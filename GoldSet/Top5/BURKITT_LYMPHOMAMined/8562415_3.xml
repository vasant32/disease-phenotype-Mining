<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural changes in leukaemic cells on initial contact with, and during migration into, layers of bone marrow stroma in vitro were examined in a variety of types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and leukaemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow fibroblasts (BMF) were grown on <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53201">polycarbonate</z:chebi> microporous membranes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells added to cultures and allowed to adhere to BMF for variable periods of time before fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) blasts showed rapid development of surface membrane microvilli on contact with BMF layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALL blasts, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell line NALM-6, showed evidence of movement in to the BMF layer within 15-30 min, with intrusion of extended cytoplasic processes into gaps between BMF cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ALL cells were frequently seen within the layers of fibroblasts after 30 min incubation, and had pronounced morphological changes, with pseudopodia and attenuated and elongated microvilli interdigitating with the surface of fibroblasts or with strands of extracellular matrix material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes were also noted in the surface membrane of BMF adjacent to ALL cells, with invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane and formation of micropits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the migratory behaviour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cells, migration was not observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> cells or other leukaemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells showed membrane activation, with variable degrees of microvillous formation, and in some cases insertion of pseudopodia into BMF layers, but migration was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural immunogold labelling was carried out to determine the localization of leukaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and their ligands on BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This demonstrated that beta 1 integrins were largely localized to the contact surfaces of both ALL blasts and fibroblasts, with VCAM-1 expressed only on the surface of BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations confirm the specificity of migratory behaviour for pre-B leukaemic cells, and indicate that a complex pattern of surface and intracellular events mediate this process, including the expression of beta 1 integrins and VCAM-1 at the sites of insertion of leukaemic cells between fibroblast margins </plain></SENT>
