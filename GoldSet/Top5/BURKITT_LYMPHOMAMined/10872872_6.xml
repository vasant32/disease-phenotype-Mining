<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We characterized the cell growth and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation for EBV infected epithelial cell lines, GT38, GT39, and GTC-4 using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell lines grew similarly in liquid medium, and formed colonies in soft agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell growth was inhibited with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, dose-dependently in liquid medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The colony formation was enhanced with low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, but was inhibited with high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latent EBV was reactivated with high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> as shown by the expression of EBV BZLF1 gene product ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> on GTC-4 were compared with a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mode of actions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in GTC-4 was different from Raji in terms of cell growth and EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effective concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> for cell growth inhibition and EBV reactivation were higher in Raji than GTC-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (20 ng/ml) induced cell cycle arrest to Raji but not to GTC-4; however, the rate of trypan blue stained cells increased in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treated GTC-4 but not Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> affects differentially for the stimulation and inhibition of cell growth, and also EBV reactivation depends on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> concentrations and cell types </plain></SENT>
