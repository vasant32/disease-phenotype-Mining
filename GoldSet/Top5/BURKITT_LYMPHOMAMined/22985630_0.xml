<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RV affects a wide variety of viruses including members of the Herpesviridae family, retroviruses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> A virus and polyomavirus by altering cellular pathways that affect <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), the causative agent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, is associated with different proliferative diseases in which it establishes a latent and/or a lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of RV against the EBV replicative cycle and investigated the molecular targets possibly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a cellular context that allows in vitro EBV activation and lytic cycle progression through mechanisms closely resembling those that in vivo initiate and enable productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, we found that RV inhibited EBV lytic genes expression and the production of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that RV inhibited protein synthesis, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and suppressed the EBV-induced activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further insights into the signaling pathways and molecular targets modulated by RV may provide the basis for exploiting the antiviral activity of this natural product on EBV replication </plain></SENT>
