<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that LMP-1 activates the immunoregulatory molecule CD69 gene transcription through a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)‑dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD69 expression was upregulated in LMP-1‑expressing EBV-immortalized human B-cell lines and an EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP-1 expression increased CD69 expression at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD69 promoter was regulated by LMP-1 activation of NF-κB via the carboxy-terminal activation region 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Promoter deletion analysis indicated that two NF-κB binding sites are necessary for activation of the CD69 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that LMP-1 activates both NF-κB binding sites in the CD69 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the regulation of CD69 expression by LMP-1, and this novel finding may, thus, represent an important link between the EBV oncoprotein LMP-1 and its critical role in the development of EBV-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
