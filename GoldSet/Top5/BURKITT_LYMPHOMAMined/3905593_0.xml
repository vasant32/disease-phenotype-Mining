<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients included in the COPAD protocol were treated with massive therapy: seven because of relapse, one because of partial remission after two months' induction therapy and two because of long delay before first complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapy used was bischloroethyl nitrosourea, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CPM) and 6-thioguanine (BACT) in nine cases and CPM in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 100%, and disease-free survival was reached in five of ten cases, including four with no evidence of disease for over two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine of ten patients who received ABMT, the bone marrow (BM) was not decontaminated, and BM involvement was found at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> prior to day 86 from ABMT in four of five failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and cytological analyses led to no firm conclusion about the role, if any, of reinjected BM in this outcome: a liquid-culture monitoring system used in six cases showed BM malignant cells present in the graft in one early relapse and absent in two relapses in which BACT failed; in three long-term survivors, no malignant cell was found in the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This first group of ten showed the efficiency of BACT and the necessity of purging BM in at least some cases before ABMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the second group, selected from 43 patients given LMB 01 and 02 protocols, eight were treated by massive therapy and ABMT: one with localized stages I and II disease, four with stage III and three with stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients received massive therapy either because of early relapse, progressive disease, partial remission after induction therapy or long delay before CR, or as a consolidation of CR in cases of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or cerebrospinal fluid involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group, four of eight are disease-free; three of them had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM by in-vitro liquid-culture monitoring; their BM was not decontaminated and they had no BM relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other five cases, BM was decontaminated by Asta Z in one and by y-29/55 antibody in four.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
