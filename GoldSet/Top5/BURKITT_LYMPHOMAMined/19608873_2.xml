<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases represented a diverse spectrum of histological types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (24 cases) and classic Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (five cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>mTORC1 was also activated in the hyperplastic but not involuted follicles of HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in eight cases, supporting the notion that mTORC1 activation is a common feature of transformed lymphocytes irrespective of either their reactive or malignant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found that in B-cell lines that represent diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Epstein-Barr virus-infected lymphocytes, and human herpesvirus 8-positive primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, inhibitors of Syk, MEK, and, seemingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3 kinases suppressed mTORC1 activation, in particular when these inhibitors were used in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other histologically similar types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are derived from transformed B lymphocytes may display clinical responses to inhibitors that directly target mTORC1 or, possibly, upstream activators of the mTORC1 pathway </plain></SENT>
