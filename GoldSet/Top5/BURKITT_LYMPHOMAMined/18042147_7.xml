<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), two major molecular subtypes, the activated B-cell-like (ABC) and the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, can be defined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), two outcome-related signatures, termed Immune response 1 (IR1) and Immune response 2 (IR2), have been identified by gene expression profiling, indicating a significant role of the microenvironment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development and progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IR1, composed of genes mostly expressed by T-cells, was found to be associated with a more favorable clinical course, and IR2, enriched for genes expressed by macrophages and follicular dendritic cells, was found to be associated with an inferior clinical course </plain></SENT>
