<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists as a life-long <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> within memory B cells, but how EBV may circumvent the innate immune response within this virus reservoir is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that the latency-associated non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of EBV may actually induce type I (antiviral) interferon production, raising the question of how EBV counters the negative consequences this is likely to have on <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed this by examining the type I interferon response in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, the only in vitro model of the restricted program of EBV latency-gene expression in persistently infected B cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we observed no effect of EBV on interferon alpha-induced signaling or evidence of type I interferon production, suggesting that EBV in this latent state is silent to the cell's innate antiviral surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did uncover, however, a defect in the negative feedback control of interferon signaling in a subpopulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines as was revealed by prolonged interferon-stimulated gene transcription consistent with sustained tyrosine phosphorylation on STAT1 and STAT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was due to inadequate induction of expression of the ubiquitin-specific protease UBP43, which removes the ubiquitin-like ISG15 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> conjugated to proteins (ISGylation) in response to type I interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results here are consistent with previous findings in genetically engineered Ubp43(-/-) murine cells that UBP43 down-regulates interferon signaling, independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity, by precluding the protein kinase JAK1 from the interferon receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This natural deficiency in UBP43 expression may therefore provide a useful model to further probe the biological roles of UBP43 and ISGylation </plain></SENT>
