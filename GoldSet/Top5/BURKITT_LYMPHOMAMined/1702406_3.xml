<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse grafts of these hybrids, however, completely regress after an initial growth phase </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the initial growth phase as well as during regression, these grafts showed the deregulated c-myc expression pattern of the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line with highly abundant c-myc transcripts originating from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> specific translocation chromosome 8q+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results question the significance of c-myc deregulation for an unlimited in vivo growth potential of B-lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the hybrids, surface expression of B-cell-specific antigens was analyzed on the hybrids and shown to correspond to that of the parental LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, transcription of the gene encoding for the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) as well as histological features were analyzed in growing versus regressing hybrid grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LMP gene, which is down-regulated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> produced by the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, was expressed in the hybrid grafts as well as in the parental LCL grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding might be compatible with a host response of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse against LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histological analysis, however, which revealed massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the center of the regressing grafts without pronounced inflammatory infiltrates, rather points to a hypoxemic process leading to graft regression </plain></SENT>
