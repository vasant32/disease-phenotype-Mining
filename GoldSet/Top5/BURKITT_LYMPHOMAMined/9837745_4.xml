<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we have investigated IL-12 expression in B cells during in vitro transformation with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human peripheral B cells became capable of constitutively producing p40 by in vitro transformation with EBV, coincident with the expression of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These B cells expressed p40 and p35 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) stimulation strongly enhanced p40 and p70 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transfection with LMP1 expression vector into a human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi, led to p40 production with nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that transformation of primary B cells with EBV induces IL-12 expression potentially through LMP1 expression </plain></SENT>
