<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR antigens, the human equivalent of mouse Ia antigens, are multimeric surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> characterized by a high degree of allelic polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are expressed specifically on macrophages and lymphocytes and they play a key role in the regulation of the immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated this complex genetic system by a direct study of the genes involved through molecular cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper deals with the cloning, in plasmids, of full-length cDNA sequences for the HLA-DR alpha chain from the human B-cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The approach relies on a translation assay of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> injected into frog oocytes and recognition of translation products by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After enrichment of specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and cloning of cDNA, plasmid clones were analyzed by hybridization-selection of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and translation in oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clone was identified and used to screen a cDNA library from which several full-length HLA-DR alpha chain plasmids were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence determination of one such clone confirmed its identity and also established the amino acid sequence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal signal sequence of HLA-DR alpha chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The translation product of HLA-DR alpha chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> purified by hybridization-selection gives a single alpha chain spot on two-dimensional gels, whereas the alpha chain released from the alpha/beta HLA-DR complex gives about seven distinct spots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the results of analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting are compatible with the existence of a single nonpolymorphic alpha chain gene and indicate extensive cross-hybridization with a homologous gene in mouse DNA </plain></SENT>
