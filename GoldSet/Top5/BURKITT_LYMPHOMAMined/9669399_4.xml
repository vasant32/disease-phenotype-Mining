<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prediction of platelet counts after therapy is important for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simple prediction methods based on linear correlation between radiation dose and blood count nadir have been insufficient because they have not considered time, because of the complicated hierarchical structure of the hematopoietic system in which platelets are not directly injured by low dose rate radiation and because of changing radiation dose rates to marrow with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study addresses these problems using a cell kinetics model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model consists of compartments for progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, platelets and stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear quadratic formula was used for progenitor cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stromal cells were described by a model based on a maximum likelihood estimate for cellular damage, repair and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reported values for murine cellular turnover rates and radiosensitivity of progenitor cells were used in the model calculations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental mice received 4 Gy of external beam radiation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> implantation and 12.4-23.3 MBq 67Cu-2-iminothiolane-BAT-Lym-1 (BAT = 6-[p-(bromoacetamido) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi>]-1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacet ic acid) 19-30 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood counts were measured three times each week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model predicted the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and the time of the nadir corresponded to measured values in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For a dose of 14.2 MBq 67Cu-2-iminothiolane-BAT-Lym-1 that induced a platelet nadir of 20% of baseline (Grade II), the model predicted that at least 20 days were needed before a second 14.2-MBq injection if a subsequent nadir of &lt;10% of baseline (Grade IV) was to be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nadir and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> predicted by the model were similar to those observed in the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Predicted information could be useful for planning the dose and timing of fractionated radionuclide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This model provides a stepping stone for future development of a predictive model for patients </plain></SENT>
