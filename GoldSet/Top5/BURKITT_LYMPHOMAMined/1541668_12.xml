<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain complementarity determining region (CDR)-III of B-lineage cells at various stages has provided important insights concerning B cell maturation and selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of human CDR-III sequences has been relatively limited compared with that of the murine system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the CDR-III sequences of B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>) cells in 23 newly diagnosed and 10 relapsed patients, in order to elucidate the organization of CDR-III in B cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a very low frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in D and JH regions, preferential use of DLR, DXP, DHQ52, and DN elements, and of 3' side JH segments, and no predominant usage of D coding frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unusual joinings such as VH-D-D-JH and VH-JH were observed in three, and one sequences, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the CDR-III sequences derived from 10 patients between diagnosis and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of them had three spots of mutated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> at relapse, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were found in the N region near the D segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data showed the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> at relapse, in addition to developmentally regulated rearrangement of the immunoglobulin gene at the stage of B cell precursors </plain></SENT>
