<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The balanced t(12;17)(p13;q12) is a rare but recurrent aberration in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> gene has been postulated as a likely candidate for involvement in the t(12;17), the precise molecular consequences of this translocation have not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified a t(12;17) in 2 of 398 childhood ALL patients karyotyped at presentation in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cases had a precursor-B immunophenotype and were CD10 negative and CD33 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization excluded involvement of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> locus in the t(12;17) and provided no evidence for concomitant cryptic deletion of the 12p commonly deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these and previously published cases demonstrates that the translocation predominately occurs in children and young adults with precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and is typically characterized by low CD10 expression and high CD33 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data support the involvement of a new locus telomeric to <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of t(12;17)-positive ALL </plain></SENT>
