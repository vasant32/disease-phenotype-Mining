<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the possibility of using anti-B4-bR in combination with chemotherapy protocols, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic effects of combining it with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Namalwa and a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-expressing cell line, Namalwa/mdr-1, obtained by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e> of Namalwa cells with the mdr-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Namalwa/mdr-1 cells were slightly more sensitive to anti-B4-bR than Namalwa cells; IC37 values were approximately 4 pmol/L and 8 pmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When anti-B4-bR was combined simultaneously with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, additive to supra-additive killing of Namalwa and Namalwa/mdr-1 cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In xenografts of Namalwa/mdr-1 cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> at their maximum tolerated doses (3 mg/kg x 3 or 15 mg/kg x 3) showed no therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with 5 daily bolus injections of anti-B4-bR (50 micrograms/kg) followed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> significantly increased the life span of the mice by 129% and 115%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment with anti-B4-bR, the Namalwa/mdr-1 population expressed lower levels of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, and this decrease may account for the synergistic action of the drug combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-B4-bR could be used to good effect in combination with current treatment regimens and further hint at a promising role for this immunotoxin in treatment of disease at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> stage, where cells may be resistant to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
