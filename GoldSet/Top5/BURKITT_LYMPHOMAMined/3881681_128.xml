<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that c-myc is an inducible gene, regulated directly by growth signals which promote proliferation and expressed in a cell-cycle dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because various leukaemic cell lines express high levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>, it was of interest to discover whether the gene could be down-regulated in these cells by a growth inhibitor such as interferon (IFN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that in Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, IFN-alpha produces a five- to sevenfold reduction in c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> through a decreased rate of c-myc gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By isolating a growth-resistant Daudi cell variant that had escaped from this down-regulation, we provide the first clear link between reduction of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the IFN-mediated G0/G1 arrest characteristic of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by screening other cell lines, we demonstrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of human leukaemic cells with respect to these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, IFN-alpha fails to reduce the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and to change the cell-cycle distribution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and U937 cells, although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> induction of other IFN-regulated activities takes place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter group of cells shows a decline in c-myc gene expression when they become arrested in the G0/G1 phase as part of their terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
