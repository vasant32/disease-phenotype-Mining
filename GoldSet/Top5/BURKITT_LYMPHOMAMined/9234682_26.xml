<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MHC-II transactivator CIITA is essential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of MHC-II gene expression examined so far and thus constitutes a master regulator of MHC-II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generated and analyzed mutant CIITA molecules which are able to suppress endogenous MHC-II expression in a dominant negative manner for both constitutive and inducible MHC-II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dominant negative CIITA mutants were generated via specific restriction sites and by functional selection from a library of random N-terminal CIITA deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This functional selection strategy was very effective, leading to strong dominant negative CIITA mutants in which the N-terminal acidic and proline/serine/threonine-rich regions were completely deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dominant negative activity is dependent on an intact C terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficient repression of endogenous MHC-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels was quantified by RNase protection analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quantitative effects of various dominant negative CIITA mutants on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of the different MHC-II isotypes are very similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimized dominant negative CIITA mutants isolated by functional selection should be useful for in vivo repression of MHC-II expression </plain></SENT>
