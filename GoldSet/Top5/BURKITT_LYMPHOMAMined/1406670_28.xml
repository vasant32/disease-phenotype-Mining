<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>9:147-152, 1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in two pairs of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, differing in the expression of the putative immortalizing gene of EBV, EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In EBNA2-expressing cells, the induction of four ISGs by IFN-alpha was strongly reduced or, in some cases, abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">Chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs containing different IFN-stimulated response elements were transfected into EBNA2-negative and EBNA2-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity by IFN was impaired in EBNA2-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, a reporter gene construct driven by an IFN-gamma-sensitive promoter element was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as revealed by gel shift assays, EBNA2-positive and EBNA2-negative cells exhibited a nearly identical pattern of IFN-stimulated response element-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most important, activation of the factor ISGF-3, which previously has been shown to be required and sufficient for transcriptional activation of IFN-induced genes, was not inhibited in IFN-resistant cells expressing EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the EBNA2-related IFN resistance seems to be distinct both from the resistance mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> virus and adenovirus gene products and from the IFN resistance in Daudi cell variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these three cases, the transcriptional block of IFN-induced genes is due to inhibition of ISGF-3 activation and binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the EBNA2-related IFN resistance in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells acts downstream of the activation of ISGF-3 </plain></SENT>
