<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From April 2003 through October 2005, 17 infants (each of whom weighed less than 10 kg) underwent the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four were girls and 13 were boys (mean age, 15.7 +/- 9.3 months [range, 2-36 months]; mean weight at the time of transplantation, 7.4 +/- 2.6 kg [range, 6-10 kg]) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen left lateral segments and 1 left lobe were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 3.5% +/- 1.2% (range, 1.5%-6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the early postoperative period, hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was identified in 2 infants, and a biliary leak in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was treated by reanastomosis with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> grafting in the first patient and by surgical embolectomy in the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The biliary leak was treated with percutaneous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 infant, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">portal vein stenosis</z:e>, which was identified during the late postoperative period, was treated by percutaneous balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At this time, 14 (82.3%) infants were alive, exhibiting good graft function at a median follow-up of 11 months (range, 2-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three infants died: 1 on postoperative day 47 from adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome, 1 on postoperative day 12 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and 1 on postoperative day 65 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection, which occurred in 5 patients, were treated with pulse steroid therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that extensive use of living-related donors in liver transplantation can result in an excellent outcome for small pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
