<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results have shown a combined modulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi>-specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, a decreased activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi>-specific PLC has been found, concomitant to a PLD-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> hydrolysis, suggesting that the intracellular signalling activated by interferon in Daudi cells involves a phospholipase D/phosphohydrolase pathway </plain></SENT>
