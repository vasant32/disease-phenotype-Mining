<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> testing was performed in 124 children with B-cell ALL, who were newly diagnosed and enrolled in the ALL-XH-99 treatment protocol from September 2001 to April 2005MRD was determined by 4-color flow cytometry in the different time points during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After induction therapy, 103, 13 and 8 patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> &lt;0.01%, 0.01%-0.1% and &gt;0.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 5-year relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> &lt;0.01%, 0.01%-0.1% and &gt;0.1% was 88.9+/-3.9%, 70.0+/-14.5% and 0%, respectively and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 82.4+/-4.4%, 21.2+/-18.0% and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> and EFS among the patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within half a year after induction remission, the 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> negative (&lt;0.01%) and positive was 87.7+/-4.1% and 58.3+/-14.2%, respectively (P&lt;0.01) and the 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> was 80.7+/-4.6% and 25.6+/-13.8%, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After half a year with induction remission, the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> negative and positive also showed statistical differences in the 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (92.0+/-3.6% vs 48.5+/-15.5%; P&lt;0.01) and EFS (85.6+/-4.5% vs 21.4+/-11.0%; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> level after induction chemotherapy together with the reaction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, the bone marrow features on the 19th day of induction, and the fusion gene with BCR-ABL or MLL-AF4 had prognostic significance in childhood B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> level in the whole course of therapy is an important outcome indicator in childhood B cell ALL </plain></SENT>
