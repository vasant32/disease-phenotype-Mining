<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serological surveys were carried out in Uganda and Tanzania to see whether the variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> incidence from high to low areas is paralleled by a variation in the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the putative Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera were collected from samples of the general child population living at high and low altitudes in the West Nile District in Uganda and in North Mara, Tanzania </plain></SENT>
