<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF) has been reported to stimulate growth of leukemic cells from B-cell precursor-<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the effects of LMW-BCGF on proliferation of leukemic clonogenic (progenitor) and nonclonogenic (progeny) cells from children with BCP-ALL (28 patients) and B-cell ALL (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were either at diagnosis (n = 18) or in relapse (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response of leukemic progenitor cells was determined by culturing cells (10(5) cells/mL) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> with 0.1 U/mL LMW-BCGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonies (greater than 20 cells) were counted at day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response of the leukemic progeny population was determined by DNA synthesis studies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53526">tritiated-thymidine</z:chebi> and by DNA quantitation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidiumiodide</z:chebi> for determination of cell-cycle status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LMW-BCGF supported growth of leukemic progenitor cells from 20 of 28 (71%) BCP-ALL and two of two B-cell ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colony numbers ranged from 7 to 2,400 (mean 145, median 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A dose-response effect in colony growth was noted, with an apparent plateau at approximately 2.0 U/mL LMW-BCGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colony cells were primarily of leukemic phenotype (CD19+/CD10+/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LMW-BCGF also induced significant increases in leukemic progeny cell proliferation as measured by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation (stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 34) and by cell-cycle assay (percentage S+ G2/M stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LMW-BCGF was more effective in stimulating leukemic proliferation than three recombinant interleukins (rIL-2, rIL-3, rIL-4), although rIL-3 was able to support colony growth in 4 of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that LMW-BCGF and, to a lesser degree rIL-3, are able to stimulate proliferation of BCP-ALL progenitor and progeny cells, whereas rIL-2 and rIL-4 do not support progenitor cell proliferation and have only marginal effects on leukemic progeny cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
