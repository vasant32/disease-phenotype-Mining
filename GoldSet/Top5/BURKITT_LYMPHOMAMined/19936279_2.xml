<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unique mechanism suggesting the role of the mitochondria as the key energy source responsible for residual cells has been assessed in the clinical setting on specimens from patients on therapy were found to have increased copies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) associated with positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and/or persistent disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential role of mtDNA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> emphasizes queries into the contributions of relevant enzymatic pathways responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study hypothesized that in an in-vitro model, recovering or residual cells from chemotoxicity will exhibit an increase in both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase expression and decrease in succinate dehydrogenase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Ramos cells (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) were exposed to varying concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> for 1 hr; and allowing for recovery in culture over a 7-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cDNA was extracted on days 1 and 7 of the cell culture period to assess the relative expression of the aforementioned genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> synthase, increase isocitrate dehydrogenase and decrease succinate dehydrogenase expressions were found in recovering Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recovering <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells appear to compensate by regulating enzymatic levels of appropriate genes in the Krebs Cycle suggesting an important role of the mitochondria in the presence of residual cells </plain></SENT>
