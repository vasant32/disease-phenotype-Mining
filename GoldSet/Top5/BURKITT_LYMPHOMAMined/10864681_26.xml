<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recently identified bfl-1 gene (also known as A1 or GRS), a homologue of bcl-2, encodes an antiapoptotic protein that suppresses <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor protein and exhibits proliferative and potent cooperative transforming activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that elevated levels of bfl-1 mRNA are a feature of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B-cell lines and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines expressing the full spectrum of EBV latent proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line in which the expression of EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is inducibly regulated by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, we demonstrate that LMP1 expression coincides with a dramatic increase in the level of bfl-1 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also in this system, an increase in the level of Bcl-2 protein was seen to occur earlier than that of bcl-2 mRNA, suggesting that both transcriptional and translational mechanisms are involved in the control of Bcl-2 expression by LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that elevated bfl-1 mRNA stability can contribute to this effect of LMP-1, thus providing evidence of a novel mechanism of gene regulation by this EBV protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of bfl-1 by LMP1 was not observed in the T-cell line Jurkat or the epithelial cell line C33A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of Bfl-1 in an EBV-positive cell line exhibiting a latency type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> protects against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by growth factor deprivation, thereby providing a functional role for Bfl-1 in this cellular context and adding Bfl-1 to the list of antiapoptotic proteins whose expression is modulated by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the regulation of bfl-1 expression by a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein, and this novel finding may thus represent an important link between the EBV oncoprotein LMP1 and its cellular growth-transforming properties </plain></SENT>
