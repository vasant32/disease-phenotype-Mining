<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Friend erythroleukemic cells (FL) and myelocytic leukemic cells (ML) accumulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> in a cap or patch-like pattern observed by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photoactivated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> induced the appearance of "holes" on the cell membrane demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytoma</z:mpath> (MS) cells accumulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> intracellularly around the nuclear envelope and as circular profiles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photoactivated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> induced development of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> on the cell membrane, and even complete cell destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> at short-term incubation periods was determined by [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">Protoporphyrin</z:chebi>, unexposed to light, reduced the incorporation of both precursors only to a moderate extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi>-treated cells exposed to light showed complete inhibition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term exposure of ML and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> in the dark induced a nearly 50% inhibition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cytotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> in the dark was lower than that of photoactivated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi>, this may possess a potential activity in vivo even without illumination </plain></SENT>
