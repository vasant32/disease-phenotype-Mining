<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that neutralization of immortalization by this monoclonal antibody is virus specific, since its potency was inversely related to the dose of challenge virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody recognized antigens on viruses grown in human as well as in marmoset cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We show that this monoclonal antibody neutralized three other transforming strains of EBV originating, respectively, from American patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> and fatal polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and from an African child with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However the antibody did not neutralize or detect antigens by immunofluorescence in the W91 strain of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hybridoma antibody did neutralize other EBV strains derived from the same Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Nyevu), as was the case with the W91 strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal antibody provides clear evidence of antigenic differences on the surface of EBVs and will ultimately prove useful in defining the antigenic site on EBV which elicits neutralizing antibody </plain></SENT>
