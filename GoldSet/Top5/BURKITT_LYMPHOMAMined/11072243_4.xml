<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, immunoglobulin variable (Ig V) region genes, c-myc re-arrangement and sequence and p53 status were analyzed in clones derived from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (LAM) in which it was previously demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred late during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such evidence was based on the finding that 2 groups of cellular clones, characterized by the same c-myc re-arrangement but different EBV-fused termini, were obtained from the LAM cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Ig V gene sequences were identical for the 2 groups of clones with different EBV-fused termini </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ig variable heavy (V(H)) gene sequence displayed a substantial accumulation of point mutations (but no intra-clonal diversification), whereas the productive Ig V lambda (V(lambda)) gene sequence was virtually unmutated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies on the Ig V kappa (V(kappa)) locus suggested a receptor revision event (with a switch from kappa to lambda chain production) prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, it was determined that the mutations observed in both p53 alleles and in the re-arranged c-myc gene occurred before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we present a model for the various steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that stimulation by an antigen or a superantigen initially favored the clonal expansion and accumulation of other cytogenetic changes, including those involved in receptor editing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These events occurred prior to or during the germinal center (GC) phase of B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, possibly upon exit of the cells from the GC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> occurred, further promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
