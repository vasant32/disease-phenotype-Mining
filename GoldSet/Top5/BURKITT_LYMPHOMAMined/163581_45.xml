<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An older median age and a predominance of presentation in abdominal and pelvic sites rather than in the jaw distinguishes this series of American patients from those reported from endemic regions in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow involvement invariably consisted of massive infiltration recognizable in smear, clot and biopsy preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or bone marrow was always associated with short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight long-term survivors <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was apparently confined to a single site at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the most consistent finding was widespread multiorgan involvement without predilection for lymphoreticular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> changed after chemotherapy, varying from diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> within 48 hours of initial therapy to extreme pleomorphism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells after 9 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, there was almost complete absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at autopsy in an organ site shown clinically to have been extensively involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
