<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 induces B lymphocyte immortalization and activates constitutive signal transduction, including NF-kappaB, JNK/p38, and JAK/STAT pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During EBV latency, LMP-1 expression induces several B lymphocyte activation markers, including intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (ICAM)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that various structurally distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI), as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatment, induced homotypic aggregation in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell-surface expression of ICAM-1 was concurrently strongly up-regulated by both HDACI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell-surface expression of ICAM-1 was concurrently strongly induced by both HDACI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among several ICAM family members, only ICAM-1 was up-regulated by both HDACI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatments, suggesting that up-regulated ICAM-1 expression might mediate the observed increase in homotypic aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HDACI-induced homotypic aggregation was blocked by exposure to a monoclonal antibody specific for the beta-chain (CD18) of an ICAM-1 ligand, LFA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, HDAC inhibition, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatment, induced LMP-1 expression in EBV-positive cell lines, and this LMP-1 species was identified by RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses as the latent form of LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control of EBV LMP-1 gene expression by HDACI inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level, as indicated by nuclear runoff studies and analysis of steady-state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dominant-negative LMP-1 efficiently blocked HDACI-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation, and ectopic expression of LMP-1 activated expression of an ICAM-1 promoter-driven reporter gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HDACI-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1, and consequent homotypic aggregation, were efficiently blocked by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> and by ectopic expression of a super-repressor IkappaBalpha, while LPM-1 induction was unaffected, suggesting that these effects are mediated by NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate, therefore, that the latent isoform of LMP-1 is induced by HDAC inhibition, and that HDACI-induced latent LMP-1 expression, through NF-kappaB activation, is responsible for ICAM-1 expression up-regulation and homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
