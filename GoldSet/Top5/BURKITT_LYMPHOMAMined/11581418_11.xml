<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, by infecting the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line Ramos, which hypermutates constitutively and can be considered a transformed analogue of a germinal center B cell, with EBV as well as by transfecting it with selected EBV latency genes, we demonstrate that expression of EBV gene products does not lead to an inhibition of hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have identified two natural EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines (ELI-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and BL16) that hypermutate constitutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, contrary to expectations, EBV gene products do not appear to affect somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
