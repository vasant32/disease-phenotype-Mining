<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because DNA segments homologous to the consensus sequences of joining and switching regions of immunoglobulin genes were detected in the unknown sequence, we speculate that the system for either V-J or switching recombination in immunoglobulin genes may be involved in forming this unusual rearrangement </plain></SENT>
