<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction studies have demonstrated the occurrence of bi/oligoclonality in a variable number of cases of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, a fact that may strongly interfere with the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonality has also been associated with a poorer prognosis and a higher chance of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To correlate bi/oligoclonality, detected by polymerase chain reaction in Brazilian children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> with a chance of relapse, with immunophenotype, risk group, and disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study of patients outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Unit of the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 47 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> DIAGNOSTIC TEST: Polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers for the CDR-3 region of heavy chain immunoglobulin (FR3A, LJH and VLJH) for the detection of clonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bi/oligoclonality was detected in 15 patients (31.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups with monoclonality and biclonality in terms of the occurrence of a relapse (28.1% versus 26.1%), presence of CALLA+ (81.2% versus 80%) or risk group (62.5% versus 60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was similar in both groups, with no significant difference (p: 0.7695) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that bi/oligoclonality was not associated with the factors investigated in the present study and that its detection in 31.9% of the patients may be important for the study and monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
