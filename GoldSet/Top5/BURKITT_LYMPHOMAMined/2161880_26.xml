<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgG treatment activated latent EBV genomes in 50 to 70% of the cells of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV-activating role of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, as potentiated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and suppressed by cAMP, was analyzed in the cells through effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of these second messenger pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early Ag (EA) was induced in 10% of cells with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 (A23187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA induction with anti-IgG or A23187 was blocked by a calmodulin <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45951">trifluoperazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DAG pathway had a potentiating but not direct effect on EBV activation because: 1) the DAG analog, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> for protein kinase C, alone induced only 2% EA-positive cells, 2) diC8 synergized with A23187 for EA induction, and 3) the protein kinase C <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>, almost completely inhibited EA induction by anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When cells were reincubated in medium with fresh diC8 and A23187 at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, EA induction at 24 h reached the levels seen with anti-IgG stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cAMP-mediated pathway suppressed EBV activation because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi> or 8-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-cAMP, plus blockage of phosphodiesterase by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi>, or use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>, inhibited EA induction with anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the principal stimulatory role in EBV activation of a Ca2(+)-mediated, second messenger pathway, as synergized by DAG and inhibited by cAMP, was established, we did not explain the significant lag in EA induction by A23187 and diC8 as compared with anti-IgG induction of EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EBV genome activation with anti-IgG is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin and DAG pathways in Akata cells, that the cAMP pathway suppresses EA induction by anti-IgG, and that a mechanism regulating the speed of EA induction remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
