<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The DG75 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived human B cell line is heterozygous for p53, carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and mutant (Arg283His) alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells constitutively express high levels of both p53 proteins and also Mdm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arg283His transactivates the p21Waf1, Mdm2, bax, cyclin G and IGF-BP3 promoters in transient transfection assays equally as well as, if not better than WT p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also suppresses the outgrowth of SAOS-2 cells and specifically binds DNA like <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in primary rodent fibroblasts Arg283His fails to suppress transformation by HPV16-E7 and (Ha-)ras and even has modest transforming activity when transfected alone with (Ha-)ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When Arg283His is transiently transfected into SAOS-2 cells it efficiently induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, so - unlike mutants such as Arg175Pro - its behaviour in transformation assays does not clearly correlate with loss of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining of both REF transformants and transiently transfected SAOS-2 revealed that this unusual mutant becomes excluded from the nucleus and produces striking cytoplasmic fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best correlation with transformation, therefore, appears to be the lack of nuclear retention of Arg283His </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since this mutation does not map to any known nuclear localization signal and its presence seems to result in aberrant exclusion from the nucleus, then it may prove very useful in exploring mechanisms involved in the nuclear:cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 </plain></SENT>
