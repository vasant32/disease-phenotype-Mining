<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 lead to loss of the suppressor function and thus contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential role of p53 mutations in a sampling of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the majority of which were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients, including allograft recipients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, Wiscott-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aldrich syndrome</z:e>, and human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus type 1 infection, in comparison with three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and four Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation in p53 was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines as well as the three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that with the exception of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, p53 mutations are not involved in the majority EBV-positive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which develop in immunocompromised patients </plain></SENT>
