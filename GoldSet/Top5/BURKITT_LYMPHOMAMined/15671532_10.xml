<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation associated 2 (IRTA2) gene encodes a cell surface receptor homologous to the family of Fc receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the restricted expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in B cell-lineage cells, IRTA2 is a new potential target for the immunotherapy of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the expression of the IRTA2 gene product, we produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to IRTA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A mouse used for cell fusion was DNA-immunized with an expression plasmid encoding the IRTA2 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of MAbs secreted from the hybridomas were characterized with recombinant proteins of IRTA family members in an enzyme immunoassay and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and blood cells from five patients with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) were analyzed with IRTA2 expression using FACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three MAbs (F25, F56, and F119) were selected based on their specific reactivity with recombinant IRTA2 and lack of cross-reactivity with other IRTA family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a FACS analysis, MAbs F56 and F119 detected IRTA2 expression in six of seven B cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one of six Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments and Western blotting using MAb F25 confirmed the expression profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that HCL cells from five patients expressed IRTA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first evidence that IRTA2 is expressed on the surface of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and HCL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IRTA2 could be useful as a new target for immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
