<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have identified the DUB family of cytokine-regulated murine deubiquitinating enzymes, which play a role in the control of cell proliferation and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through data base analyses and cloning, we have identified a human cDNA (DUB-3) that shows significant homology to the known murine DUB family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blotting has shown expression of this gene in a number of tissues including brain, liver, and muscle, with two transcripts being apparent (1.6 and 1.7 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, expression was observed in cell lines including those derived from a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> such as the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line RAJI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also demonstrated that DUB-3, which was shown to be an active deubiquitinating enzyme, is induced in response to interleukin-4 and interleukin-6 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have demonstrated that constitutive expression of DUB-3 blocks proliferation and can initiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that human DUB-3, like the murine DUB family members, is transiently induced in response to cytokines and can, when constitutively expressed, block growth factor-dependent proliferation </plain></SENT>
