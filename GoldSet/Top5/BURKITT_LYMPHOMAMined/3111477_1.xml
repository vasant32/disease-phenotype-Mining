<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the cytotoxic effects of nitrosoureas with and without a 42-hr preincubation with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, 1 mM) in a MER+ (methylation excision repair positive) human cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DFMO combined with a chloroethyl nitrosourea [1,3-bis-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) or 1-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47553">2-chloroethyl</z:chebi>)-1-nitrosourea (CNU)] yielded increased toxicity with D37 ratios of 1.9 and 3.3 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no enhanced toxicity with the monofunctional nitrosourea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ENU</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCNU or CNU did not induce DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks in cells with or without a DFMO pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA single-strand breakage was not increased by addition of DFMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BCNU-induced DNA-protein crosslinking was decreased in cells pretreated with DFMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are similar to those in MER- cells in that the chloroethyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="27594">carbonium</z:chebi> alkylating species is required for the enhanced cytotoxicity seen with DFMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability to form DNA interstrand crosslinks, however, does not appear to be necessary for this toxicity enhancement </plain></SENT>
