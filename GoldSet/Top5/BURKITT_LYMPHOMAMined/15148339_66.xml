<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)1 contains a glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain that appears to protect the antigen from proteasomal breakdown and, as measured in cytotoxicity assays, from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted presentation to CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This led to the concept of EBNA1 as an immunologically silent protein that although unique in being expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, could not be exploited as a CD8 target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using CD8+ T cell clones to native EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> upstream and downstream of the GAr domain and assaying recognition by interferon gamma release, we show that the EBNA1 naturally expressed in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) is in fact presented to CD8+ T cells via a proteasome/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transporter-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LCL recognition by such CD8+ T cells, although slightly lower than seen with paired lines expressing a GAr-deleted EBNA1 protein, leads to strong and specific inhibition of LCL outgrowth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endogenously expressed EBNA1 is therefore accessible to the MHC class I pathway despite GAr-mediated stabilization of the mature protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We infer that EBNA1-specific CD8+ T cells do play a role in control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in vivo and might be exploitable in the control of EBV+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
