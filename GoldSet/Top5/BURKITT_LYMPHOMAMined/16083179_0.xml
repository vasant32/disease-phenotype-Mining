<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 5 HIV-infected patients were enrolled to evaluate their EBV-specific T cell responses by Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) ELISpot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had detectable T cell responses, mainly directed at Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors wanted to see whether it was possible to augment magnitude and spectrum of the EBV responses by stimulating patient PBMC with cells presenting autologous EBV antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors successfully established spontaneously EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBVh-BCL) and used them for generation of EBV-specific CTL (EBV-CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBVh-CTL lines established in the present study were not only highly cytotoxic against the autologous virus but also able to secrete IFNgamma detected by ELISpot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors are now in the process of generating these lines in a large number and in a clinical grade for adoptive immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
