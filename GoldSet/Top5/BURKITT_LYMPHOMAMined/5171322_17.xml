<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This impaired responsiveness is partly related to an intrinsic cellular defect but an inhibiting factor in the serum of coeliac patients has also been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impaired coeliac lymphocyte response in this in-vitro test system may serve as an indicator of a comparable defect in immune surveillance in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This would account for the increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e> known to arise in patients with longstanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coeliac disease</z:e> and might also explain the raised incidence of other gut-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
