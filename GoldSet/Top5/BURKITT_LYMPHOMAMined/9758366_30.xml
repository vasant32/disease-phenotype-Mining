<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunodetection of this protein is a useful method for distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although bcl-2 might also be a useful marker for distinguishing reactive monocytoid B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> from its putative malignant counterpart, marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there were no extensive studies to date that tested this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a survey of bcl-2 expression in 778 cases of NHL using immunohistochemical techniques applied to routinely processed and paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 20 reactive monocytoid B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, none were bcl-2 positive, compared with 118 (79%) of 150 marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to the follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in our study, of the 110 Grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 107 (97%) were bcl-2 positive, 119 (83%) of the 143 Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive, and 71 (74%) of the 96 Grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 positivity of Burkitt-like high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was significantly different from that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4 [67%] of 6 vs. 0 of 5; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T-cell NHL had a significantly lower bcl-2 positivity than did B-cell NHL (10 [45%] of 22 vs. 627 [83%] of 756; P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, bcl-2 is a highly sensitive marker for follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a useful marker for distinguishing reactive monocytoid B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> from marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> The significant difference in bcl-2 positivity between Burkitt-like high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> suggests an additional diagnostic use for this protein </plain></SENT>
