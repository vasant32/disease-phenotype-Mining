<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Genes coding for DNA polymerases eta, iota and zeta, or for both Pol eta and Pol iota have been inactivated by homologous recombination in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BL2 cell line, thus providing for the first time the total suppression of these enzymes in a human context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The UV sensitivities and UV-induced mutagenesis on an irradiated shuttle vector have been analyzed for these deficient cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The double Pol eta/iota deficient cell line was more UV sensitive than the Pol eta-deficient cell line and mutation hotspots specific to the Pol eta-deficient context appeared to require the presence of Pol iota, thus strengthening the view that Pol iota is involved in UV damage translesion synthesis and UV-induced mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A role for Pol zeta in a damage repair process at late replicative stages is reported, which may explain the drastic UV-sensitivity phenotype observed when this polymerase is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A specific mutation pattern was observed for the UV-irradiated shuttle vector transfected in Pol zeta-deficient cell lines, which, in contrast to mutagenesis at the HPRT locus previously reported, strikingly resembled mutations observed in UV-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancers</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a Pol eta PIP-box mutant (without its PCNA binding domain) could completely restore the UV resistance in a Pol eta deficient cell line, in the absence of UV-induced foci, suggesting, as observed for Pol iota in a Pol eta-deficient background, that TLS may occur without the accumulation of microscopically visible repair factories </plain></SENT>
