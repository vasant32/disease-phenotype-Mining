<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a stemline with a 14q+ marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The origin of the extra segment on No. 14 was determined, and it was different in the two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations, and those from non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with 14q+ markers reported in the literature, indicate an inconsistent pattern for the origin of the extra material on No. 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only feature in common for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases is instability of the distal region of the long arm of No. 14, and liability of this region to be involved in structural rearrangements, particularly translocations </plain></SENT>
