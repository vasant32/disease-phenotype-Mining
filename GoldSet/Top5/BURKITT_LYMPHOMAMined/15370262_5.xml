<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The associated poor prognosis and potentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and its blastoid variants make differentiation from other non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> especially important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a marked leukemic component, which demonstrated both a typical nodular mantle cell pattern and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within a single lymph node removed at the time of splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of CD5, CD10, and Bcl-1 co-expression by immunohistochemistry and detectable t(11;14) and cMYC gene rearrangement by FISH analyses in the Burkitt region support a transformation of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> over a concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A limited number of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> demonstrating dual t(11;14) and chromosome 8q24 cMYC gene rearrangements have been previously reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They demonstrate an extremely aggressive course with a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the accelerated terminal phase of this patient's clinical course mirrors these previous published cases; none have described the combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case provides further support for the aggressive nature of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and demonstrates the utility of flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic techniques in avoiding potential errors in their diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment </plain></SENT>
