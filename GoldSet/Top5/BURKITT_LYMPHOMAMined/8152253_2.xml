<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the possibility of involvement of this gene in childhood B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, cells from 23 pediatric patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were examined for expression and alteration of the Btk protein and also for mutations in the btk gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Btk proteins, similar in both molecular weight and quantity to those seen in unaffected individuals, were detected in whole cell lysates from the blasts of 12/12 patients indicating that no abnormal protein was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cDNAs from the leukemic blasts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 patients were screened with specific primers covering the coding region of the btk cDNA for mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found but a nucleotide polymorphism was identified in 4/23 patients at the 3' end of btk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size in this study was relatively small, these data suggest that btk does not appear to play a critical role in childhood B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
