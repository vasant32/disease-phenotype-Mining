<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An unexpected feature of the latency II form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">epithelial tumor</z:e> nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) is the presence of spliced polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> encoded from the BamHI A fragment of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome and running in the opposite orientation to several BamHI-A lytic cycle genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of these BamHI-A transcripts and the specificity of their association with NPC remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the extent to which such <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are present in other transcriptionally distinct forms of EBV latency seen in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent assays of BamHI-A transcription were employed: amplification across defined splice junctions in cDNAs, using the polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization with a radiolabeled riboprobe specific for a putative open reading frame downstream of these splice junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such methods, which easily detected BamHI-A <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in fresh NPC biopsies and transplantable NPC lines, also revealed consistent expression of these transcripts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines displaying the highly restricted latency I form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (BamHI-F promoter usage) as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) displaying the latency III form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (BamHI-C/W promoter usage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression in established LCLs, occurring irrespective of virus producer status, was not a consequence of continued in vitro passage; thus, appropriately spliced BamHI-A transcripts could be amplified from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells within 1 day of their experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in vitro, along with BamHI-C/W promoter-initiated but not BamHI-F promoter-initiated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization both on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and on LCLs showed that essentially every cell contained BamHI-A transcripts, although at levels apparently lower than those observed in NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that expression of the BamHI-A <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> is a consistent feature shared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known forms of latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
