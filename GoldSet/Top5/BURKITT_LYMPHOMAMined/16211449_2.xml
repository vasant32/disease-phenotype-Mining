<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Financial considerations have led to suggestions that routine microscopic evaluation of tonsils and adenoids is neither cost effective nor clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility of tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> must be carefully weighed when making institutional policy decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One way to find an appropriate algorithm for pathologic examination is to examine the characteristics of biopsy-proved tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients who had non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and large-cell or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the tonsils and adenoids and were registered on Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (POG) protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven (9%) of 832 POG cases of NHL involved the tonsils and adenoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of the pathology reports available from 29 of these cases revealed that NHL was incidentally discovered by pathologic examination in only 5 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which had clinical evidence of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272386" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar enlargement</z:e> or size discrepancy by gross examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 24 cases indicated a clinical suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0558355,C0751560" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tonsillar cancer</z:e>, as judged by a preoperative diagnosis or by a request for frozen-section examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in most cases there is a clinical suspicion of tonsillar NHL at the time of gross examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With routine cases, we predict that the use of comparative organ weights, a clinical impression of tonsillar asymmetry, and review of clinical history will increase the recognition of tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> when "gross-only" protocols are employed for specimen handling </plain></SENT>
