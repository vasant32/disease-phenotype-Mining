<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of MYC with immunoglobulin genes is a hallmark of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this rearrangement is not entirely specific and is often accompanied by varying numbers of additional cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the impact of karyotypic complexity, in correlation with comprehensive immunophenotypic analyses on the diagnosis and clinical outcomes of 34 cases of MYC-IG rearranged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that included Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (twenty-two cases), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three cases), unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (six cases), and plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 26 of 34 cases (76%), including four cases (12%) that harbored dual translocations involving BCL-2 or BCl-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases had a significantly lower number of additional abnormalities (mean of 1.7), compared with unclassified B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3.3), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (21.7), and plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with simple karyotype (&lt; or =2 additional abnormalities) were more likely to have a diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (89 versus 33% in patients with &gt;2 additional abnormalities, P&lt;0.01) and express bcl-6 (95 versus 47%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, bcl-6 expression, and simple karyotype were individual predictors of better overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate analyses, only bcl-6 expression remained an independent predictor, although survival could be further stratified by karyotypic complexity in bcl-6(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that simple karyotype and bcl-6 expression suggest a diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and may portend better overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may be very useful in the diagnosis and stratification of MYC-IG rearranged high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
