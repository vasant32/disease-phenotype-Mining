<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) is currently used in clinical trials for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, in virtue of its ability to inhibit cell growth and to promote cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the pleiotropic pharmacological activity of ATRA is of fundamental relevance for an effective use of the compound in clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper reports on the effects of ATRA treatment on the cell surface expression of a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules known to regulate the interactions between the effectors of the immune system and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) cell lines exposed to ATRA selectively up-modulate the surface expression of ICAM-1/CD54, a molecule regulating cell/cell contacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such effect could be reproduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the BC cell lines analyzed, independently of their hormone receptor status, indicating that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> are irrelevant in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regulatory effects on ICAM-1 expression are time- and dose-dependent and reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other differentiating and proliferating agents comparatively tested, e.g. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> or dexamethas one, are ineffective, indicating that ICAM-1 up-modulation is uniquely featured by ATRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second observation is that ATRA treated cells are, only apparently, less sensitive to lysis by lymphocytes activated by IL-2, as determined by means of a standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, notwithstanding this effect, a marked reduction in the ability to form colonies was highlighted in ATRA treated versus control lines after incubation with LAK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the clonogenic killing effect could be reversed using anti-CD54 mAbs as blocking tools, indicating that ICAM-1 plays a key role in the phenomena </plain></SENT>
