<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether EBV activation might also affect proteasome subunit composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, independently of the latency program established in the host cells, induction of the EBV lytic cycle reduces the expression of the proteasomal components β5, β1 and β2i, whereas it increases that of β2, β1i, PA28α and PA28β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modulation of the composition and enzymatic activities of the proteolytic complex are indicative of a less efficient generation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> immunoepitopes </plain></SENT>
