<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These started in the medulla as small osteolytic foci which coalesced and penetrated the cortex causing subperiosteal new bone formation in layers or spicules, and giving rise to large soft-tissue masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Common sites were the femoral and tibial diaphyses and the metaphyses around the knee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five were in the epiphyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other sites were the pelvis, humerus and ulna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had a lymphomatous synovial effusion of the knee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the lower limbs the lesions were often bilateral and symmetrical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathological fractures</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiologically the lesions mimicked Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043388" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PIAN">yaws</z:e>, but clinically they were relatively painless, an important differential diagnostic feature </plain></SENT>
