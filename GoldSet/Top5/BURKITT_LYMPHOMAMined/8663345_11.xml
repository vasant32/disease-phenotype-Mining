<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When these cell lines were cultured with concanavalin A for a long period of time, a subpopulation of some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cell lines was induced to express new lambda light chains replacing the original lambda chain (light chain shifting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Production of the new lambda chain, which replaces the original lambda chain, results from a VJ rearrangement at a previously excluded allele and a dramatic reduction of the original lambda chain transcript, although no difference was found in the level of heavy chain transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombination activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2, which are normally expressed during specific early stages of lymphocyte development, were expressed in not only the light chain shifting-inducible lines but also in the non-inducible cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these Ig secreting cell lines with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi>, which is known to enhance expression of the RAG genes, could not induce the creation of new lambda light chain-producing cells from the inducible lines, suggesting that the expression of the two RAG genes is not sufficient for inducing new lambda light chain production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concanavalin A induced a gradual but significant production lost of the original lambda chain in a subpopulation of the light chain shifting-inducible cells but not in the non-inducible cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association of new lambda light chain production with loss of original lambda chain raises the possibility that, when the RAG genes are expressed, concanavalin A may act on a novel intracellular mechanism controlling lambda light chain allelic exclusion in these plasma cell lines </plain></SENT>
