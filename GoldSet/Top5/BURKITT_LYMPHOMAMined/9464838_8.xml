<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Ramos B cell line can be induced to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to a variety of different agents, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophores</z:chebi>, anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) and macromolecular synthesis inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, following up-regulation of the Fas (CD95) surface receptor by CD40 ligation, these cells also become susceptible to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by Fas ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that protection from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>- and macromolecular synthesis inhibitor-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD40 ligation is associated with a rapid up-regulation of Bcl-xL followed by a more moderate and delayed up-regulation of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that overexpression of Bcl-xL, like Bcl-2, protects Ramos cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>, anti-Ig and macromolecular synthesis inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to Bcl-2, ectopic overexpression of Bcl-xL does not rescue from Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in Ramos B cells, the Fas apoptotic pathway exhibits differential sensitivity to inhibition by Bcl-2 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings also suggest that CD40 signaling provides a switch which renders the cells susceptible to Fas-ligand mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through up-regulation of Fas whilst affording protection from anti-Ig-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through up-regulation of Bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
