<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that over-expression of c-myc facilitates the replication of SV40 DNA in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we investigated the ability of N-myc and L-myc to substitute for c-myc in promoting SV40 DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vectors expressing either a chimeric N-myc/c-myc, N-myc or L-myc gene were constructed and co-transfected with a plasmid containing the SV40 origin of replication and the early genes encoding SV40 T antigens (Tag) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chimeric N-myc/c-myc and the N-myc proteins enhance SV40 replication in the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BJAB at levels comparable to c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulative effect of N-myc is also evident in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line RAMOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, L-myc stimulated SV40 replication only in RAMOS cells </plain></SENT>
