<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two hybridomas that produce the mAbs 135 and 449 B4 were obtained that inhibited the binding of IgE to the Fc epsilon RL/CD23 on the EBV-transformed B cell line RPMI 8866 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>mAb 135 was obtained from a mouse immunized with RPMI 8866 cells, whereas mAb 449B4 was obtained from a mouse immunized with a partially purified preparation of Fc epsilon RL/CD23 obtained as the eluate of an IgE immunoabsorbent loaded with a soluble extract of RPMI 8866 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two mAbs bound to Fc epsilon RL/CD23- cell lines and precipitated two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with 36,000 Mr and 28,000 Mr, which were the HLA-DR alpha and beta chains, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with mAb 135 of NP-40 lysates from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29826">dithio</z:chebi>-bis(succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi>) (DSP) crosslinked 125I-labeled RPMI 8866 or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells incubated with rIL-4 showed three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with 42,000, 36,000, and 28,000 Mr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 42,000 Mr <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> is identical to the Fc epsilon RL/CD23 since it could be precipitated by the anti-Fc epsilon RL/CD23 mAb 25 after resolubilization from the <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitations of the crosslinked cell extracts carried out with the anti-Fc epsilon RL/CD23 mAb 25 yielded the same three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when RPMI 8866 or rIL-4 preincubated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells were solubilized with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi> buffer, which prevents the dissociation of noncovalently linked <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> complexes, mAb 135 and mAb 25 precipitated complexes composed of three molecules with 42,000, 36,000, and 28,000 Mr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The well-characterized anti-HLA-DR mAb L243 was unable to block the binding of either IgE or mAb 135 to RPMI 8866 cells, although it could immunoprecipitate the complex (HLA-DR-Fc epsilon RL/CD23) from crosslinked cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since mAb 135 and L243 were able to both bind the RPMI 8866 cells, it demonstrates that they bind to different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the HLA-DR complex, the mAb 135 epitope of the HLA-DR molecule being close to the IgE binding site of the Fc epsilon RL/CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrated that the Fc epsilon RL/CD23 and HLA-DR antigens are spatially associated on the B cell membrane </plain></SENT>
