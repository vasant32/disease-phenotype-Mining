<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the 8; 21 and 15; 17 translocations, respectively, are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the 8q24 translocations including 8; 14, 2; 8, and 8; 22 translocations seen in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the 1; 19 and 11; 14 translocations seen associated with pre-B-cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, respectively, are examples of similar correlations with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the cases of 9; 22 (Ph1) and 11q23 translocations, each of which is found in both myeloid and lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, any one abnormality is rarely encountered in association with both categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that, with regard to many of the known chromosome translocations, the break occurs at a point close to the location of a specific cellular oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, c-myc and c-abl, which reside in 8q24 and 9q34, respectively, are known to undergo rearrangement in cases of 8q24 and 9; 22 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements have been proved to give rise to the production of an abnormal protein, which seems to cause the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of cells with such chromosome translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome translocations are now believed to be directly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> through the mechanism of activation of the cellular proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
