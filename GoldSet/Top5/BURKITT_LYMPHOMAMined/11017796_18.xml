<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is required for the maintenance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> chromosome in latently infected, proliferating cells and plays a role in latent cycle DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 also functions as a positive and negative regulator of EBV gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the interaction of EBNA-1 with p32, a host <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein that associates with EBNA-1 in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that a fraction of p32 localizes to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent cycle origin of DNA replication oriP in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p32 binds EBNA-1 independently of other proteins or DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 variants lacking one of two p32 binding elements did not interact stably with p32 in cultured cells and were defective for both transcriptional activation of a reporter gene linked to oriP FR and replication and/or maintenance of a plasmid bearing oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support a role for p32 in transcriptional activation by EBNA-1 and suggest that p32 plays a role in EBV latent cycle DNA replication </plain></SENT>
