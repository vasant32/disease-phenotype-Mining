<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study evaluating the antigenic determinant of such cells that mediate this effect, a monoclonal antibody (I57) was raised against the Daudi cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This antibody was found to interact with a 30-kDa protein on these cells and had agonistic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It enhanced the B lymphoblastoid accessory cell and interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent stimulation of PHA-treated murine thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect of I57 on PHA-treated thymocytes was more pronounced at high, supraoptimal concentrations of the lectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast with the effect of IL-1 that failed to stimulate these cells treated with PHA at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>I57 also enhanced stimulation of thymocytes treated with IL-2 alone or with both PHA and IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>I57 exhibited by itself mitogenic activity for human T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cells, treated with IL-2, were further stimulated by I57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>I57 seems to be different from other agonistic antibodies that have been described so far </plain></SENT>
