<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reasons are given for considering that there is sufficiently substantial indirect and circumstantial evidence linking Epstein-Barr (EB) virus to African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> to call for a dynamic new approach to establish a causal role for the virus in these human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It would seem that the only way to do this would be to develop a vaccine, vaccinate a population at risk in a high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-incidence area, and subsequently follow the population for a consequential decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent developments in the control of animal herpesvirus-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> by vaccines free of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nucleic acid make it possible to envisage that a similar vaccine could be developed against EB virus without undue difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments showing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-inducing ability of EB virus in South American subhuman primates have provided an in vivo laboratory system in which to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trial of the vaccine in human populations could be carried out by testing its ability to protect those at risk from primary EB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although in world terms <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is not a major health problem, nevertheless African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> provides uniquely favorable conditions in which to test for a causative role for EB virus: high incidence areas are known, the peak <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence is at the age of 5 or 6, and the effects of vaccination on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> incidence could be assessed within a decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Should a carcinogenic role for EB virus be demonstrated in African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, a much longer term program would be called for to extend the vaccine control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> to areas where EB virus is implicated in the induction of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although a high incidence of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is confined to populations of Southern Chinese origin, the very large numbers of such people and the frequency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> among them make this a substantial world health problem and, therefore, worth the cost and effort necessary to develop a vaccine giving life-long immunity and to conduct a program that will take more than a generation to give positive results </plain></SENT>
