<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>Malignant tumors</z:mp> of the head and neck are very rare in children, and their symptoms are usually uncharacteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are of mesenchymal origin: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As their growth is quick and destructive, irreversible damage of adjacent structures or even infiltration of the endocranium occurs early and rapidly, resulting in a dramatic deterioration of survival rate and life quality in advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Three cases of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant head-and-neck tumor</z:e> in children are described, stressing typical key symptoms which might often be neglected or misinterpreted as aggravation or psychogenic if the physician is not aware of the possibility of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic and therapeutic approach is illustrated according to the tentative diagnosis and the underlying histologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In any suspicious case, diagnostics must start immediately and often under emergency conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interdisciplinary communication is mandatory from the beginning and should be directed by oncopediatricians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since there are often fundamental differences in diagnostic procedures and therapeutic regimen compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> in adults, unnecessary repetitive examinations and consecutive delay in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of therapy can be avoided by early planning of a diagnostic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic principles differ widely from those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following biopsy, histological examination, and staging, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> chemotherapy and/or radiation is usually performed, but surgical procedures are indicated only in rare cases in the presence of a very small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutilating surgery is always contraindicated in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Restaging should follow conservative therapy, after which surgical removal of necrotic masses or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> may be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of diagnostics and therapy is crucial for children's prognosis concerning survival and function of affected organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An interdisciplinary approach is mandatory from the beginning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In early cases, this strategy gives a chance to restore organ function and life quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In advanced cases, life and a residual organ function may be preserved but complete restoration is rare, especially if a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> is the underlying histologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
