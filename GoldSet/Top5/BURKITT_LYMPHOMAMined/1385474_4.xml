<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have investigated the effects of IL-4 on the proliferation and differentiation of leukemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cell precursors (BCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that IL-4 significantly inhibited spontaneous [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> ([3H]-TdR) incorporation by leukemic blasts from some B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) patients (8 of 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-4 was found to suppress the spontaneous and factor-dependent (IL-7 and IL-3) proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BCP (CD10+ surface [s] IgM- cells) isolated from fetal bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum growth inhibition of either leukemic or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BCP was reached at low IL-4 concentrations (10 U/ml), and the effect was specifically neutralized by anti-IL-4 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-4 was further found to induce the expression of CD20 antigen on BCP-ALL cells from a number of the cases examined (5 of 8), but in contrast to leukemic cells, IL-4 failed to induce CD20 antigen on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, IL-4 was found to induce neither the expression of cytoplasmic mu chain, nor the appearance of sIgM+ cells in cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or leukemic BCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that IL-4 has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation in leukemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B lymphopoiesis but is unable to drive the transition from BCP to mature B cells </plain></SENT>
