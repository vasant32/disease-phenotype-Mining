<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While modern intensive chemotherapy protocols cure the majority of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the prospects of cure with salvage chemotherapy for relapsed or refractory disease are minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data on the results of allografting for well characterised Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in particular little on the impact of GVHD on transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with t(8;22) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who underwent an HLA-identical sibling allograft in second complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred at day 60 post-transplant, without pre-existing GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GVHD subsequently developed after withdrawal of immunosuppression and administration of alpha-interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> regressed, consistent with a graft versus Burkitt's effect, until progression at day 200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A delayed, partial and transient response subsequently occurred to rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches should be considered for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> unable to be cured by conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
