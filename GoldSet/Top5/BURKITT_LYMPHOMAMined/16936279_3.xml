<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperphosphorylation results in functional inactivation of RB, activation of the E2F transcriptional program, and entry of cells into S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RB unphosphorylated at serine 608 has growth suppressive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of serines 608/612 inhibits binding of E2F-1 to RB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Nalm-6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> extracts, serine 608 is phosphorylated by CDK4/6 complexes but not by CDK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that phosphorylation of serines 608/612 by redundant CDKs could accelerate phospho group formation and determined which G1 CDK contributes to serine 612 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that CDK4 complexes from Nalm-6 extracts phosphorylated in vitro the CDK2-preferred serine 612, which was inhibited by p16INK4a, and fascaplysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serine 780 and serine 795 were efficiently phosphorylated by CDK4 but not by CDK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the redundancy in phosphorylation of RB by CDK2 and CDK4 in Nalm-6 extracts is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serine 612 phosphorylation by CDK4 also occurred in extracts of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cells but not in extracts of mobilized CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon could contribute to the commitment of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to proliferate and explain their refractoriness to differentiation-inducing agents </plain></SENT>
