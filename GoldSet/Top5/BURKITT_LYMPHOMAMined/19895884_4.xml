<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> is a B cell differentiation antigen (Gb3/CD77) strongly expressed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that, in these cells, VT-1 induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via a caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we provide new insights into this signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we demonstrate that VT-1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> requires degradation of the caspase-8 inhibitory molecule c-FLIPL and that this degradation occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activation is mainly due to i) cleavage and activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid by caspase-8 and ii) Bax relocalization to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membranes which lead to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, tBid is not involved in Bax relocalization, and relocalization is most likely controlled by the extent of Bax phosphorylation: in non-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, p38 MAPK participates in the retention of Bax in the cytoplasm in an inactive form whereas in VT-1 treated cells, protein phosphatase 2A is activated and induces Bax relocalization to mitochondria </plain></SENT>
