<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the c-myc oncogene becomes joined to an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene in a head-to-head configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within c-myc, the breaks frequently occur near the first exon-intron boundary, while within the immunoglobulin gene the breaks usually involve sequences directing heavy-chain switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that the translocations represent abortive immunoglobulin switching events which have activated the c-myc gene for a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, sequence analysis of the c-myc gene does not reveal any apparent similarity to the immunoglobulin switch signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With these results in mind, we have determined the precise breakpoints within c-myc for two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> lines in order to search for any common features that may shed some light on the mechanism of chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report here that the tetranucleotide sequence GAGG occurs close to the breakpoint in five out of six translocations, and so may be a sequence recognized by either the enzymes that catalyse immunoglobulin heavy-chain switching, or some other DNA-cleaving activity </plain></SENT>
