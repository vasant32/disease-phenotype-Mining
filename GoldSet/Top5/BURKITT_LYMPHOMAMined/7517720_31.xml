<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicated increased accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53376">polyglutamates</z:chebi> (MTX-PG) in blast cells as a predictor of favorable treatment outcome in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the expression of FPGS activity in blasts from children with ALL at diagnosis and after treatment with MTX as a single agent, before conventional remission induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of enzyme activity in ALL blasts at diagnosis (median of 689 pmol/h/mg protein) were significantly higher (P = .003) than those found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) blasts (median of 181 pmol/h/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparable lineage differences in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid versus nonlymphoid cells suggest a lineage-specific control of FPGS expression, FPGS activity increased in ALL blasts after in vivo exposure to MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median increase in FPGS activity was significantly higher (P = .003) in B-lineage ALL (188%) than in T-lineage ALL (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the percentage of intracellular long chain MTX-PG (Glu3-6) was significantly higher (P = .02) in B-lineage ALL (92%) than in T-lineage ALL (65%), consistent with higher FPGS activity in B-lineage blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding could explain, at least in part, the superior outcome in children with B-lineage ALL treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
