<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because this complication appears to stem from a deficiency of EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells, we assessed the safety and efficacy of donor-derived polyclonal (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) T-cell lines as immunoprophylaxis and treatment for EBV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients considered to be at high risk for EBV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> each received 2 to 4 intravenous infusions of donor-derived EBV-specific T lymphocytes, after they had received T-cell-depleted bone marrow from HLA-matched unrelated donors (n = 33) or mismatched family members (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The immunologic effects of this therapy were monitored during and after the infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infused cells were identified by detection of the neo marker gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-specific T cells bearing the neo marker were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial analysis of DNA detected the marker gene for as long as 18 weeks in unmanipulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and for as long as 38 months in regenerated lines of EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients (15.5%) had greatly increased amounts of EBV-DNA on study entry (&gt;2, 000 genome copies/10(6) mononuclear cells), indicating uncontrolled EBV replication, a complication that has had a high correlation with subsequent development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients showed 2 to 4 log decreases in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA levels within 2 to 3 weeks after infusion and none developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, confirming the antiviral activity of the donor-derived cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no toxic effects that could be attributed to prophylactic T-cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients who did not receive prophylaxis and developed overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> responded fully to T-cell infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal donor-derived T-cell lines specific for EBV proteins can thus be used safely to prevent EBV-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> after allogeneic marrow transplantation and may also be effective in the treatment of established disease </plain></SENT>
