<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were absent and lymphoblastoid cell lines could not be established from 197 samples, which were characterized by limited initial cell proliferation and development of an adherent population, followed by cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 2-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 14 aspirates, after a similar pattern of growth, cell proliferation began again after about 6 weeks, with a rapid appearance and growth of cell clumps from the feeder layer--a type of growth typical of spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 22 aspirates, growth of malignant cells was observed in culture and cytocentrifuged, stained smears, including marrow samples from 9 patients in whom the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells had not been ascertained or even suspected by cytology </plain></SENT>
