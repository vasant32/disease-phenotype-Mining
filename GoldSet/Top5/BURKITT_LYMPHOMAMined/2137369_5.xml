<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The loss of expression of the enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (the Mex- phenotype), which often results from cellular transformation, confers hypersensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed two unrelated examples in which human cell lines have undergone a spontaneous alteration in their Mex phenotype during propagation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The change was reversible and was not the result of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases a loss of methyltransferase expression was accompanied by a simultaneous loss of expression of two metabolically unrelated enzymes: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase and galactokinase. "Reversion" to methyltransferase expression was accompanied by simultaneous reexpression of both kinase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third example of this coordinate gene regulation was seen with the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji which expresses methyltransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase, and galactokinase at high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase- Raji cell line derived by bromodeoxyuridine mutagenesis that is also Mex- was found to be galactokinase- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears that methyltransferase expression may in some instances be coordinately regulated with the tk and glk loci which are closely linked on human chromosome 17 </plain></SENT>
