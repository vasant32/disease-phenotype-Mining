<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GP7 (4-[4''-(2'', 2'', 6'', 6''-tetramethyl-l''-piperidinyloxy) amino] -4'-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin) is a new spin-labeled derivative of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50305">podophyllotoxin</z:chebi> semi-synthesized by our university </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the activity of L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> in GP7-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GP7 induced time- and dose-dependent apoptotic DNA fragmentation accompanied by caspase-3 activation in Raji cells, and the kinetics of caspase-3 activation induced by GP7 was well correlated with that of apoptotic DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> treatment prevented GP7-induced caspase-3 activation, suppressed caspase-3 cleavage and abrogated GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that L-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> is a potent anti-apoptotic agent to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and may exert its anti-apoptotic effect via inhibition of caspase-3 activity in GP7-treated Raji cells </plain></SENT>
