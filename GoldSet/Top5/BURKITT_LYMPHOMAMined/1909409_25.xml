<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) patients were analyzed for the configuration of their immunoglobulin (Ig) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements and/or deletions of the Ig heavy chain (IgH), Ig kappa chain (Ig kappa), and Ig lambda chain (Ig lambda) genes were detected in 98, 48, and 23% of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these percentages suggest the presence of a hierarchical order in IgH and Ig light chain (IgL) gene rearrangements during B-cell differentiation, no correlation was found between the immunophenotype of the precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and the arrangement patterns of their IgH and IgL genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple rearranged IgH gene bands, generally differing in density, were found in 27 (45%) of the precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> in various restriction enzyme digests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data were used to determine whether the presence of more than two rearranged IgH gene bands was caused by hyperdiploidy of chromosome 14 or other chromosome 14 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined cytogenetic and IgH gene data allowed the precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> to be divided into three groups: a monoclonal group (n = 36; 60%), a biclonal group (n = 16; 27%), and an oligoclonal group (n = 8; 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five biclonal ALL biclonality at the Ig kappa gene level was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such subclone formation was not detected at the Ig lambda gene level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the detection limit of the Southern blot technique is 2-5%, it might well be that small subclones remained undetected, implying that the frequency of subclone formation at the IgH gene level in precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> is probably higher than 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with multiple IgH gene rearrangements have a higher tendency to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although higher relapse rates were found in the oligoclonal group (53%) and in the combined bi-oligoclonal group (33%) compared with the monoclonal group (20%), the log rank trend test showed no significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of multiple subclones in precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> as found by IgH gene analyses will severely hamper the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mediated amplification of '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific' IgH gene junctional regions, because it cannot be predicted which detectable (or undetectable) subclone will cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> and/or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore it can be expected that the PCR technique will frequently produce false negative results during the follow-up of precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
