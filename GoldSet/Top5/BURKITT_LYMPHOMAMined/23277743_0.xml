<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, diagnostic challenges are common in low-income and middle-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to assess the agreement between a clinical diagnosis of childhood non- Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) assigned in Uganda, a pathological diagnosis assigned in Uganda, and a pathological diagnosis assigned in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included children with suspected NHL referred to the Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, between 2004 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical diagnosis was assigned at the Mulago National Referral Hospital, where tissue samples were also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained slides were used for histological diagnosis in Uganda, and were re-examined in a pathology laboratory in The Netherlands, where additional pathological, virological and serological testing was also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement between diagnostic sites was compared using kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical and pathological diagnoses from Uganda and pathological diagnosis from The Netherlands was available for 118 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The agreement between clinical and pathological diagnoses of NHL assigned in Uganda was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84-95; kappa 0.84; P &lt; 0.001) and in The Netherlands was 49% (95% CI 40-59; kappa 0.04; P = 0.612) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was considered separately from other NHL, the agreement between clinical diagnoses in Uganda and pathological diagnoses in Uganda was 69% (95% CI 59-77; kappa 0.56; P &lt; 0.0001), and the corresponding agreement between pathological diagnoses assigned in The Netherlands was 32% (95% CI 24-41; kappa 0.05; P = 0.326) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The agreement between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pathological diagnoses assigned in Uganda and The Netherlands was 36% (95% CI 28-46; kappa 0.11; P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical diagnosis of NHL in Uganda has a high probability of error compared with pathological diagnosis in Uganda and in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, agreement on the pathological diagnosis of NHL between Uganda and The Netherlands is very low </plain></SENT>
