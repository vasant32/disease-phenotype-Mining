<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results described here provided an example of a human IgM monoclonal antibody against a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> and of the unusual properties of its corresponding immunotoxin (IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody referred to as 38-13 has been previously described and reacted with the globotriaosylceramide [Gb3:<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>(alpha 1----4)-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>(beta 1----4)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17234">Glc</z:chebi>(beta 1----1)<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>] specifically expressed on surface membrane of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An immunotoxin (38-13 IT) combined with the pokeweed antiviral protein (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) toxin via S-S bridges showed paradoxically a lower cytotoxic effect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Ramos cells than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells such as leukemic mouse L1210 cells, while these cells appeared not to be involved by flow cytometric analysis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the inhibitory effect of selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> analogs on the binding and the cytotoxicity of 38-13 antibody conjugated or not to <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> toxin was compared on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> blocked in alpha configuration provided a fine inhibition of 38-13 binding on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Ramos cells and both alpha and beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> allowed us to establish a clear distinction between the pathway entry of 38-13 IT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells; in close correlation with the 38-13 binding specificity the 38-13 IT cytotoxic effect in Ramos <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells could also be prevented by alpha-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> only, suggesting that this toxic action is probably mediated through the IT binding to Gb3 antigenic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, on apparently irrelevant L1210 cells, 38-13 IT showed a cytotoxic effect which was inhibited preferentially by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> in beta configuration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was discussed that IT binding alone to either antigenic sites which are inhibited by the hapten alpha-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>, or nonspecific sites which can compete with the hapten beta-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> is unable to induce efficient killing of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But cooperation of both bindings might give an attractive explanation of IT cytotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the unexpected activity of 38-13 IT in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells probably could be mediated through an active macromolecular transport process which could implicate a beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi>-binding protein (lectin) </plain></SENT>
