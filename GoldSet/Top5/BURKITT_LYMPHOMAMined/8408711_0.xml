<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surface phenotype of Burkitt's cells were positive for CD19, CD20, HLA-DR, CD14, CD33 and surface immunoglobulin markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although cytogenetic analysis was not performed, the c-myc and heavy immunoglobulin genes had the same 14.2 kilobase EcoRI molecular size fragment, suggesting a possible t(8;14) translocation which is a common marker of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The c-abl oncogene was also rearranged in DNA digested BamHI and EcoRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physiopathological implications of the rearranged c-abl gene are unknown, this being the first case, as for as is known, of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> with a rearranged c-abl gene </plain></SENT>
