<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) functions as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor, and reduced levels of p27(Kip1) connote poor prognosis in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p27(Kip1) levels are predominately regulated by ubiquitin-mediated turnover of the protein, which is marked for destruction by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(Skp2) complex following its phosphorylation by the cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding of phospho-p27(Kip1) is directed by the Skp2 F-box protein, and this is greatly augmented by its allosteric regulator Cks1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have established that programmed expression of c-Myc in the B cells of Emu-Myc transgenic mice triggers p27(Kip1) destruction by inducing Cks1, that this response controls Myc-driven proliferation, and that loss of Cks1 markedly delays Myc-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and cancels the dissemination of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that elevated levels of Skp2 are a characteristic of Emu-Myc <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that bear MYC/Immunoglobulin chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, Myc-mediated suppression of p27(Kip1) was abolished in Skp2-null Emu-Myc B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of Skp2 loss on Myc-driven proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> was surprisingly modest compared with the effects of Cks1 loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings suggest that Cks1 targets, in addition to p27(Kip1), are critical for Myc-driven proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
