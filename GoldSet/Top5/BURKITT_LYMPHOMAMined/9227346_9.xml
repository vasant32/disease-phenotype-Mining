<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TdT is known as a useful marker for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but its detection usually requires fresh tissue specimens or cell suspensions, using either an enzyme analysis or immuno-fluorescence or -peroxidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until the recent development of the use of microwave-treated paraffin sections for immunoperoxidase staining, detection of TdT in paraffin sections required rather complicated processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This new simple technique was applied to paraffin sections from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue specimens of 16 patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and of seven patients with non-endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is sometimes difficult to differentiate from lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> because of their similar clinicopathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, as a control, ten cases each were examined of adult T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e>) and angioimmunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AILD), which are both peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells from 15 of the 16 (94 per cent) patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were found to be TdT-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the anti-TdT antibody used was confirmed by immunoblot and the specific 60 kD band was detected only in a specimen of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that the immunostaining of TdT on paraffin-embedded sections is a useful method for differentiating lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method is applicable to a routine diagnostic service </plain></SENT>
