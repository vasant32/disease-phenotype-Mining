<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the involvement of Fas-mediated pathway in the killing activity of purified human CD3-, CD16+ NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fas ligand <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed in freshly isolated NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was identified by the fragmented chromatin in individual cells, was induced in the cells that expressed high levels of Fas via direct NK-to-target cell interaction or Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, even in Ca(2+)-free medium, in which perforin pores are known not to be formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> in both the presence and absence of external <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> was inhibited by Fab of an anti-Fas mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the Fas gene in target cells facilitated the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, compared with the parental cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The function of the Fas-mediated pathway in the coexistence of the perforin-dependent pathway was examined in 10 cell lines expressing different levels of Fas by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> imaging and morphologic observation of single cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a certain boundary level, low or high levels of Fas expression in target cells were correlated to a great degree with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> due to severe membrane damage after NK-target cell contact or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at a later period, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that Fas ligand/Fas interaction is present and plays a significant role in the human NK cell-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
