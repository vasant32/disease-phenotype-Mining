<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cells to 3 atmospheres of pressure HPO for 2 hr produces inhibition of DNA synthesis and mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous exposure to HPO and ADM results in decreased cytotoxicity compared to drug treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, exposure to ADM (0.15 microgram/ml) 2 to 8 hr before or after HPO produces an increase in drug effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no potentiation of lower ADM concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity is increased when cells are exposed to HPO during, before, or after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> (NSC 762) (0.15 and 0.25 microgram/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> (NSC 762) concentrations are not potentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HPO potentiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> appears to depend upon the agent studied, the concentration of the agent, and the scheduling of the drug and HPO exposure </plain></SENT>
