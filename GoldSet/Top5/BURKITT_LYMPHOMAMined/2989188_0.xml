<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The extracellular calcium level required for proliferation was compared in B lymphoid cell lines from various sources by determining the calcium concentration at which long-term proliferation was inhibited by 50% (CaPD50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines had a mean CaPD50 of 44 +/- 28 microM whereas 45 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained by in vitro transformation of B lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) had a mean CaPD50 of 3.6 +/- 1.8 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference applied also to autologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and LCLs established from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decreased calcium requirement of virally-transformed compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived cell lines therefore appears to be a universal phenomenon in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> group, no correlation was found between the calcium requirement for proliferation and presence or absence of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arrest of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and LCLs occurred in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and was readily reversed by addition of calcium to the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One anomalous LCL was found which showed a high CaPD50 (43 +/- 6 microM) and accumulated in both G1 and G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results, in combination with a previous study of EBV transformation in vitro, indicate that the calcium dependence of B lymphocytes generally decreases in the following order: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells greater than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells = early stage transformation greater than LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2 transformed phenotypes thus distinguished in human lymphoid cells may offer unique opportunities for defining the status and expression of EBV in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
