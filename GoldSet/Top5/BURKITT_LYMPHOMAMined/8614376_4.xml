<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo monitoring of pharmacokinetic parameters of leukemic blast cells were initiated in order to contribute to the pharmacological basis of optimal ara-C treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral or bone marrow blast cells from 66 leukemic patients [51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) were separated and incubated with ara-C for 1 hour and in ara-C-free medium for another 3 hours, and the intracellular formation and retention of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight children who received continuous ara-C infusion for induction treatment, the ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> concentration in circulating blast cells was monitored in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in vitro values observed in this assay corresponded to the cellular levels monitored in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> retention differed clearly among the individual groups, as classified by immunophenotype at the time of the initial diagnosis: non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> 67+/-25% (x+/-SD, n=33), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> 37+/-15% (n=8), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 34+/-18% (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> retention between non-T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward lower ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> retention in relapsed as compared with newly diagnosed ALL, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximal accumulation of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> (after 1 hour incubation) was comparable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, and blast cells from children in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed similarity of cellular accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and the significantly more rapid decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> provide the pharmacokinetic rationale supporting the prolonged infusion duration for ara-C in these subgroups as an alternative to the intensification by high-dose ara-C schedules with short-term infusion </plain></SENT>
