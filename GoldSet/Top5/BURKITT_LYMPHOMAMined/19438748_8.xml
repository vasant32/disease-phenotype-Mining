<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that UbcH10 overexpression is associated with aggressive thyroid, ovarian and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate UbcH10 expression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cell lines and tissue samples of Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) were screened for UbcH10 expression at transcriptional and translational levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UbcH10 expression was related to the grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, it was low in indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and high in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and NHL cell lines and in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was highest in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry of cell lines confirmed that UbcH10 expression is cell-cycle dependent, steadily increasing in S phase, peaking in G(2)/M phase and dramatically decreasing in G(0)/G(1) phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also showed that UbcH10 plays a relevant role in lymphoid cell proliferation, since blocking of its synthesis by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference inhibited cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that UbcH10 is a novel lymphoid proliferation marker encompassing the cell cycle window associated with exit from mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its overexpression in aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> suggests that UbcH10 could be a therapeutic target in this setting </plain></SENT>
