<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concurrent BCL2 and MYC translocations (BCL2(+)/MYC(+)) were identified in 54 samples by karyotype and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with the aim of correlating clinical and cytogenetic characteristics to overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCL2(+)/MYC(+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were diagnosed as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> unclassifiable (BCLU; n = 36) with features intermediate between Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (n = 17), or follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of a t(14;18), 5 cases were BCL2 protein-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonimmunoglobulin gene/MYC (non-IG/MYC) translocations occurred in 24 of 54 cases (44%) and were highly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up of 5.3 years, 6 patients remained in remission and 32 died within 6 months of the MYC(+) rearrangement, irrespective of whether MYC(+) occurred at diagnosis (31 of 54) or transformation (23 of 54; P = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A non-IG/MYC translocation partner, absent BCL2 protein expression and treatment with rituximab-based chemotherapy, were associated with a more favorable outcome, but a low International Prognostic Index score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were independent predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
