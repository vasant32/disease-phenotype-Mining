<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were stratified morphologically into three subtypes: Burkitt's (B; 18 patients); non-Burkitt's (NB; 21 patients); and small noncleaved, not-otherwise-specified (NOS; 10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age at presentation was 10 years for B; 12 years for NB; 6 years for NOS; and 10 years overall </plain></SENT>
