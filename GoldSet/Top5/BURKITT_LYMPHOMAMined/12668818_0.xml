<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referral hospital, Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n=10) with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> managed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital from January 1995 to December 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were men with a median age of 39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median CD4 cell count at the time of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 0.056 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with the exception of one systemic Burkittlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed in seven patients and three had primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined antiretroviral therapy was continued or given to five of the six patients who received some form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the two patients with primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received whole brain irradiation therapy, one patient survived 41 months in clinical remission after diagnosis and the other patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> while in partial remission 19 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The four patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received standard- or reduced-dose chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> had a median survival of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical profiles of these patients were similar to those of patients with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of patients was poor with conventional chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other innovative treatment approaches should be investigated to prolong the survival of this patient group </plain></SENT>
