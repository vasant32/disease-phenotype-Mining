<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one cell line, L chain transcripts made up of either V kappa I subgroup gene J kappa 3 or V kappa IV gene-J kappa 4 recombination products bore a similar alteration: the donor splice site of the rearranged J kappa segment was modified, leading to the alternate use of the donor site of either the leader <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> exon or the next 3' unrearranged J kappa segment </plain></SENT>
