<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natural killer (NK) cells, through the activating receptor FcgammaRIIIa (CD16), play a major role in rituximab-mediated ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the in vitro effect of NK stimulators, such as interleukin-15 (IL-15) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides A-Class (CpG ODN A), in the enhancement of rituximab-mediated ADCC against B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), purified NK cells, or NK-depleted PBMC from healthy donors, were activated with IL-15 or CpG ODN A, and cocultured with B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the presence of rituximab to evaluate the enhancement of the cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rituximab-mediated ADCC of IL-15-activated PBMC was twofold compared to unstimulated PBMC (73% +/- 7% vs 37% +/- 5% respectively, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, rituximab-mediated ADCC was enhanced when PBMC were activated with CpG ODN A as compared to CpG ODN control (61% +/- 11% vs 36% +/- 8%, respectively, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the ADCC of purified NK cells was increased only with IL-15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK-depleted PBMC activated with either IL-15 or CpG ODN A showed no ADCC, suggesting that NK are the major effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-15 or CpG ODN A-activated PBMC, but not activated purified NK cells, secreted large amounts of interferon-gamma in the presence of rituximab-coated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-15 and CpG ODN A enhance rituximab-mediated ADCC against B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, NK cells seem to be the main effector cells mediating ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that these agents could be used as adjuvants in combination with rituximab for patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
