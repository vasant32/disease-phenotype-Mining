<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Retrotransposition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts gives occasionally rise to functional retrogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through acquiring tempero-spatial expression patterns distinct from their parental genes and/or functional mutations in their coding sequences, such retrogenes may in principle reshape signalling networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we present evidence for such a scenario, involving retrogenes of Rap1 belonging to the Ras family of small GTPases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified two murine and one human-specific retrogene of Rap1A and Rap1B, which encode proteins that differ by only a few amino acids from their parental Rap1 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Markedly, human hRap1B-retro and mouse mRap1A-retro1 acquired mutations in the 12th and 59th amino acids, respectively, corresponding to residues mutated in constitutively active oncogenic Ras proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical and structural analyses support a functional evolution scenario, where Rap1 isoforms of retrogenic origin are functionally distinct from their parental proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> retrogene-encoded GTPases have an increased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>/GDP binding ratio in vivo, indicating that their conformations resemble that of active <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-bound Rap1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We furthermore demonstrate that these three Rap1 isoforms exhibit distinct affinities for the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, when tested for their capacity to induce key cellular processes like integrin-mediated cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> or cell spreading, marked differences are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data lend strong support for an evolution scenario, where retrotransposition and subsequent mutation events generated species-specific Rap1 isoforms with differential signaling potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of the constitutively active human Rap1B-retro in cells like those derived from Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and bone marrow from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) warrants further investigation into its role in disease development </plain></SENT>
