<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data are in agreement with the model involving the passive transport of the unbound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> across the rate-determining plasma membrane, with rapid distribution within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell interior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effective permeability (P-e) and partition (K-e) coefficients of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterols</z:chebi> were inversely proportional to the serum concentration in the external media due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi>-serum binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the mechanism in which only the unbound solute in the external solution participates in the membrane transport process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> serum levels, P-e and K-e increased with increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15889">sterol</z:chebi> polarity: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17737">desmosterol</z:chebi> greater than cholesterol greater than beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27693">sitosterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
