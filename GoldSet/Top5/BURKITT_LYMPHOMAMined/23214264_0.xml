<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV lytic cycle was blocked by inhibiting the transcription of immediate-early genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the PMBE has anti-EBV activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the extract is potentially useful in preventing the lytic development of EBV in vitro </plain></SENT>
