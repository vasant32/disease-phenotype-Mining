<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can immortalize human B lymphocytes and controls their resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is associated with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> leads to the post-transcriptional down-regulation of expression of the proapoptotic protein <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This process involves the phosphorylation of BimEL by the constitutive EBV-activated kinase ERK1/2, followed by its degradation through the proteasome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that ectopic expression of BimEL in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can enhance the sensitivity of these cells to serum deprivation-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBV-mediated resistance to growth factor deprivation in human B lymphocytes is dependent on BimEL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that this regulatory pathway is an important contributor to the oncogenic potential of EBV </plain></SENT>
