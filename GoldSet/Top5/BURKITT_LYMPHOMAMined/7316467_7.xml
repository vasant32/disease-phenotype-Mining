<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin are stable and at these loci are phenotypically identical to the individuals from whom they are derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> and some lines from patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> show a tendency to increased apparent homozygosity, presumably resulting from loss of expression of one or other allele during culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the cytogenetic evidence this suggests that progressive loss of functional parts of the genome with time in culture is a characteristic of lines derived from malignant lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
