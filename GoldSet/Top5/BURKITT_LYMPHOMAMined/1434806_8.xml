<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genetic sequence of the third complementarity determining region (CDR III) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene was analysed in 55 rearranged alleles from 36 children presenting with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This confirmed the unique nature of these rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, contrary to the hypothesis that the CDR III is produced by a random process of rearrangement, biased utilisation of diversity (D) segments and of joining (J) regions 4, 5 and 6 was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, preferred sequence boundaries were seen in J regions 1 to 5 and were suggested at the 3'-end of certain D regions, notably D21/9 and DK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of rearrangement have been noted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphocyte clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with relatively limited N nucleotide addition, these factors may restrict the potential sequence variability at the D-N-J junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of clonal progression by secondary gene rearrangements, such as V-V replacement, favours the use of this site when designing clone-specific oligonucleotide probes for use in monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases where biased features of D-J rearrangement are shared by both the leukaemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphocyte clones this could reduce the sensitivity of these probes in detecting low levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
