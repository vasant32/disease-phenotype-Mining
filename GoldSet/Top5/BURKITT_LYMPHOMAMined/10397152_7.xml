<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation of an intracellular motif of Fc gamma RIIb has been shown to be a prerequisite of the inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After being phosphorylated by BCR-activated tyrosine kinases, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (P-ITIM) of Fc gamma RIIb recruits SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi>) and polyphosphoinositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) to the vicinity of BCR, which in turn dephosphorylate their specific substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This leads to the interruption of signal transduction, consequently to the anergy and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The downstream signaling pathways affected by Fc gamma RIIb-BCR co-clustering are not clarified yet, neither the substrates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTPs</z:chebi> are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have studied the Fc gamma RIIb mediated B cell inhibition on human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (BL41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the lysates of BL41 cells SHP-2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), as well as the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lyn bind both to the BCR-co-clustered Fc gamma RIIb and to its P-ITIM <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lyn hyperphosphorylates the P-ITIM associated molecules, including SHIP in the in vitro protein tyrosine kinase activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P-ITIM-compelled multi-phosphoprotein complex binds to and activates SHP-2, which in turn dephosphorylates SHIP and Shc and probably other substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localisation of these signaling molecules is regulated by the phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions, thus dephosphorylation may result in the re-direction of Shc and SHIP within the cell, consequently, in the modulation of their activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, co-clustering Fc gamma RIIb and BCR or Fc gamma RIIb and CD19 on the intact cells inhibited PI3-K activity as detected in the anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) precipitates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that SHP-2 bound to and activated by the BCR co-clustered Fc gamma RIIb, may down-regulate PI3-K activity by dephosphorylating a yet unidentified regulatory molecule, which recruits PI3-K to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
