<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The structure of the c-myc locus and the flanking chromosomal region was investigated by Southern blot analysis of DNA from bone marrow aspirates from 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main abnormality detected was the rearrangement of the MLVI-4 locus, 20 kilobases 3' of c-myc, which was observed in seven cases (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of these rearrangements were detected at the time of the initial diagnosis, four during treatment, and one at relapse, and their presence correlated with unresponsiveness to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MLVI-4 locus represents the human homologue of the Moloney <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus integration-4 locus (Mlvi-4), a common region for provirus integration in Moloney murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus-induced T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Provirus integration in this locus activates c-myc, and two additional genes, Mlvi-4 and Mlvi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene was rearranged in one patient; mutations involving the first exon of c-myc, frequently detected by altered restriction enzyme recognition sites in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, were not observed in these <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
