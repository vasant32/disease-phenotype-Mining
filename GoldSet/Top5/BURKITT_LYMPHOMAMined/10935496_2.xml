<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated a single telomere expansion in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>), where half of the cells in the bone marrow sample appeared with a Philadelphia chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparing telomere sizes in Philadelphia-positive versus -negative cells, we found generally shorter telomeres in the Philadelphia-positive cells, but with an expansion of the telomere on the long arm of one chromosome 11 homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This expansion was also found in a minority of Philadelphia-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The telomeres in these cells were of the same overall size as the telomeres in the Philadelphia-negative cells without the 11q expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that the order of events was: 11q telomere expansion, Philadelphia translocation, overall telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expanded 11q telomere contained the standard telomeric (AGGGTT)(n) repeat, but also variant repeat sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The single telomere expansion suggests a non-telomerase mechanism behind the expansion which may also explain the presence of variant repeats in the expanded telomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present case illustrates that telomere changes may occur at only some chromosome ends in a subset of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To reveal such changes, telomere <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> should be studied with in situ methodology </plain></SENT>
