<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, stable R-loops are formed co-transcriptionally in mutants of THO, a conserved nuclear complex involved in mRNP biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such R-loops trigger genome instability and facilitate deamination by human AID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanisms that generate genome instability mediated by mRNP biogenesis impairment and by AID, we devised a yeast chromosomal system based on different segments of mammalian S regions and c-MYC for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and THO mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that AID acts in yeast at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs) which in turn cause chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AID-induced translocations were strongly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants, consistent with the idea that AID-mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study not only provides new clues to understand the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability, but also shows that, once <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> residues are produced by AID-mediated deamination, these are processed into DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements by the general and conserved DNA repair functions present from yeast to human cells </plain></SENT>
