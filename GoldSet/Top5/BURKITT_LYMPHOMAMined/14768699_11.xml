<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen biopsies from 91 cases of African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined by immunofluorescence methods for the presence of surface-associated mu, gamma, delta, kappa and lambda chains, as well as for the Fc region of gamma chains and for beta1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 5% of the biopsies were surface-Ig-negative; 18% were negative for mu chains and 61% for gamma chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delta chain staining was absent, or borderline in a few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mu chains, gamma chains in a few highly reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and, in many cases, the predominant light chain seemed to be clonal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They gave no convincing evidence of more than one cell clone, either within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumors</z:e> or within syn- or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in one individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gamma chains in moderately stained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, Fc and beta1C correlated with each other and the first two reactivities decreased after incubation at low pH, indicating that their presence resulted from outside coating of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that one clone of B cells is involved in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the large majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This clone is in a state of differentiation at which surface delta chains are not expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No prognostic information resulted from the analysis of the markers studied </plain></SENT>
