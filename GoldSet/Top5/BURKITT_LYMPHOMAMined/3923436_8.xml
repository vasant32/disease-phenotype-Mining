<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we have determined the structure of the two reciprocal products of a translocation that joins the 5' portion of the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin mu switch recombination signal on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By determining the nucleotide sequences at the translocation crossover points of both product chromosomes, we precisely locate these points with respect to nearby genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This determination allows us to conclude that translocation involves nonhomologous recombination, is highly conservative of c-myc sequences (deleting only 16 bp at the crossover point), but deletes over 2 Kb of immunoglobulin sequences from the mu switch signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mu constant and c-myc genes are joined head-to-head about 3 Kb apart, while the IgH enhancer and an aberrantly rearranged D/J region are linked to sequences 5' of c-myc on the reciprocal product </plain></SENT>
