<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> express on their plasma membranes particular subsets of the 247 defined cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens, which may resemble those of precursor cells along the lineages of differentiation to mature myeloid and lymphoid leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of use of CD antigen expression (immunophenotyping) for identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> has been constrained by the technique used, flow cytometry, which commonly specifies only three CD antigens in any one assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are diagnosed using a combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunophenotype, cytochemistry, and karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a rapid, simple procedure, which enables concurrent determination of 50 or more CD antigens on leukocytes or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in a single analysis using a microarray of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A suspension of cells is applied to the array, and cells only bind to antibody dots for which they express the corresponding CD antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with significantly raised leukocyte counts, the resulting dot pattern then represents the immunophenotype of those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients at earlier stages of disease, the diagnosis depends on recognition of dot patterns distinct from the background of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distinctive and reproducible dot patterns have been obtained for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood leukocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The consensus pattern for CD antigen expression found on CLL cells taken from 20 patients in descending order of cells bound was CD44, HLA-DR, CD37, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD52, CD45RA, CD22, CD24, CD45, CD23, CD21, CD71, CD11c, and CD9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antigens that provided the best discrimination between CLL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood leukocytes were CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD25, and CD37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results obtained for the expression of 48 CD antigens from the microarray compared well with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The microarray enables extensive immunophenotyping, and the intact cells captured on antibody dots can be further characterized using soluble, fluorescently labeled antibodies </plain></SENT>
