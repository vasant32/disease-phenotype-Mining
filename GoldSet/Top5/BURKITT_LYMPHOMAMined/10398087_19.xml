<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genotyping studies indicate that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> represent B cells that contain somatically mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This implies that the precursors of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> have participated in the germinal centre (GC) reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore presumed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues from children living in developing regions would harbour an increased number of EBV-infected cells within the GC, when compared with children living in industrialized nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, hyperplastic tonsils from 40 children living in Bahia (Brazil) and 40 from German children were analysed for the presence of EBV-encoded small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) and EBV-encoded proteins by in situ hybridization and immunohistology, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> rate was similar in both groups (50 per cent of Bahian vs. 45 per cent of German cases), a significantly higher number of EBER-positive lymphoid cells were found in the GCs of 8/20 EBV-positive tonsils from Brazil (9-89 cells/GC; mean: 14.5 cells/GC per case), while only 3/18 tonsils from Germany displayed a few EBER positive cells (1-9 cells/GC; mean: 0.5 cell/GC per case) in this compartment (p &lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EBV-infected GC cells in Bahian samples resembled centroblasts, exhibited mitotic activity, and in two cases showed expression of EBV-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, findings not present in German samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that latently EBV-infected cells participate more frequently in GC reactions in developing regions than in industrialized countries and may abnormally express the oncogenic protein LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could in part explain the higher incidence in this region of EBV association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> related to GC cells or their progeny, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
