<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are of intermediate or high grade histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical manifestations and response to different chemotherapy regimens in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> NHL in the San Juan City and San Juan Veterans Administration Hospitals from 1990-1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (10 M/1F) with an average age of 46 (range 31-68) were analyzed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology was diffuse large cell in 6, Burkitt's in 4 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> in 1.73% of patients presented with Stage III/IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sites included gastrointestinal tract (2), skin/soft tissue (2), paranasal sinus (1), kidneys (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment regimen was the modified m-BACOD (64%) </plain></SENT>
