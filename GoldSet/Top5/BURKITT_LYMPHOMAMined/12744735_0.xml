<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients were positive for CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in expression of CD34 (96.2% vs 65.6%), CD10 (96.2% vs 71.8%) and CD38 (43.8% vs 95.4%) between bcr/abl-positive and -negative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In bcr/abl-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> group, the co-expression rates of CD10(+)/CD19(+)/CD34(+), CD10(+)/CD34(+)/HLA-DR(+) and CD10(+)/CD34(+)/CD38(-) were 92.3% (24/26), 73.1% (19/26) and 56.2% (9/16), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In bcr/abl-negative group, co-expression of CD10(+)/CD19(+)/CD34(+) and CD10(+)/CD34(+)/HLA-DR(+) were 43.8% (14/32) and 37.5% (12/32), respectively, there were significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) between bcr/abl-positive and -negative groups, but none of the cases co-expressed CD10(+)/CD34(+)/CD38(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement (58.8%, 10/17) was lower in bcr/abl-positive group than that (85.7%, 12/14) in bcr/able-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression rates of CD34 and CD10 are higher, and CD38 and IgH gene rearrangement are lower in bcr/abl-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases, CD10(+)/CD34(+)/CD38(-) is a unique feature of immunophenotype, and this phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells is closer to that of early B-lineage progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
