<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had greater than 25% bone marrow lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only five of 32 patients (16%) presented with an abdominal mass; however, 24 cases (75%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB L3</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison with findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e>, these 32 children were older (median age, 8 years) and had a higher incidence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease at presentation (22%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one were white, and 24 were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blast cells from individual cases expressed mu kappa (n = 13), mu lambda (n = 9), gamma kappa (n = 1), alpha kappa (n = 1), or mu with an undetermined light chain (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequently identified cytogenetic abnormality was the classic B cell-associated t(8;14)(q23;q24) (n = 4); the t(1;19)(q23;p13.3), t(9;22)(q23;q11), and t(1;22) were observed in single cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were treated uniformly on a single protocol designed for children with advanced B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>; therapy for the other 12 children varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine children (28%) are surviving event-free; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one for 3 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that approximately 25% of children with B cell ALL are curable with intensive multiagent chemotherapy and that classification by immunophenotyping is superior to use of clinical and/or lymphoblast morphologic features </plain></SENT>
