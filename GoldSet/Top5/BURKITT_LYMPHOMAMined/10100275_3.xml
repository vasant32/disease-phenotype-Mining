<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve age-matched healthy children were included as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum ICAM-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) than those in the control group (median values: 350.9, 286.4, and 138.4 ng/mL, respectively; P &lt; .01 in each comparison) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients high levels of serum ICAM-1 could be correlated with high ESR (P &lt; .01), whereas no statistically significant difference could be found when serum ICAM-1 titers were compared with stages, B symptoms, and histological subgroups, probably because of the inadequate number of patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of ICAM-1 was mainly attributed to lymphocytes, vessels, and weakly to Hodgkin's cells, and this was significantly high in patients who were in advanced stages of disease </plain></SENT>
