<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is often associated with B-cell regulatory control disturbance and delayed appearance of neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD81 is a cellular receptor for HCV and can bind to HCV envelope protein 2 (E2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD81 also participates to form a B cell costimulatory complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether HCV influences B cell activation and immune function through E2 -CD81 engagement, here, human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji cells and primary human B lymphocytes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi>) were treated with HCV E2 protein and cell culture produced HCV particles (HCVcc), and then the related <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that both E2 and HCVcc triggered phosphorylation of IκBα, enhanced the expression of anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> Bcl-2 family proteins, and protected Raji cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi> cells from Fas-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, both E2 protein and HCVcc increased the expression of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD81 itself, and decreased the expression of complement receptor CD21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects were dependent on E2-CD81 interaction on the cell surface, since CD81-silenced Raji cells did not respond to both treatments; and an E2 mutant that lose the CD81 binding activity, could not trigger the responses of both Raji cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects were not associated with HCV replication in cells, for HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) and HCVcc failed to infect Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, E2-CD81 engagement may contribute to HCV-associated B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and insufficient neutralizing antibody production </plain></SENT>
