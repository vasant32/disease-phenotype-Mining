<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of the virus was monitored by radioactivity and Epstein-Barr virus-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) induction in sensitive indicator cells (Ramos) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peaks for both activities occurred in the 17 to 18% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlabelled virus recovered in the peak fraction was labelled with 125I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and 125I-labelled purified virus bound quantitatively to receptor-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines but not to EBV-receptor-negative T-lymphocyte-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi>-labelled virus that was allowed to bind to Raji cells was present in the interior of briefly trypsinized cells after 3 h incubation at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results provide a convenient method for detecting the EBV receptor by radioactively labelled virus </plain></SENT>
