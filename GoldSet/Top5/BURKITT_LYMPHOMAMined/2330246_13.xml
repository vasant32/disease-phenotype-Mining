<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been used in many adults and several children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A blood pump was used in three of the four patients, while spontaneous arterial flow was adequate in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration was performed for varying lengths of time, from 11 hours to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had worsening of cardiovascular status or required increased pressor support during continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration </plain></SENT>
