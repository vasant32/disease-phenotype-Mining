<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, a hybrid was obtained between the Daudi (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) line and the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hybrids were extensively characterized by means of chromosome, isozyme, and HLA surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic differences between the parent cell lines allowed some conclusions with respect to the expression of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes, C3 and EBV receptors, and of immunoglobulin and beta 2-microglobulin-HLA expression as well as the influence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell (K562) genome on B-cell properties in the Daudi-K562 hybrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-cell and differentiated markers of these hybrids were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-level expression dominated for the marker C3 and EBV receptors, which showed a good correlation coefficient of 0.84, as was true for Fc receptors and surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Daudi-K562 hybrid showed loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-cell markers but retention of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell markers (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> synthesis) </plain></SENT>
