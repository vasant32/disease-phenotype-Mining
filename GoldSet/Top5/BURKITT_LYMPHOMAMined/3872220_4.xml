<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, human monocyte cytotoxin and lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin have been critically compared in terms of specificity, physicochemical characteristics and antigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite their similar pattern of reactivity with a panel of cell lines, lymphotoxin was less readily adsorbed than monocyte cytotoxin by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxins could also be distinguished by their behavior on high performance liquid chromatography and by the failure of antibody to monocyte cytotoxin to react with lymphotoxin </plain></SENT>
