<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that CX3CL1/fractalkine, a chemokine and intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, is released rapidly from apoptotic lymphocytes, via caspase- and Bcl-2-regulated mechanisms, to attract macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effective chemotaxis of macrophages to apoptotic lymphocytes is dependent on macrophage fractalkine receptor, CX3CR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CX3CR1 deficiency caused diminished recruitment of macrophages to germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, sites of high-rate B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first demonstration of chemokine/chemokine-receptor activity in the navigation of macrophages toward apoptotic cells and identify a mechanism by which macrophage infiltration of tissues containing apoptotic lymphocytes is achieved </plain></SENT>
