<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which the TIMPs stimulate cell growth is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we have demonstrated that rTIMP-2 was growth-stimulatory for human foreskin fibroblasts (HSF4, HSF43, HS68), <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells (A549), human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells (WM115), and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line RAMOS, and this stimulatory response was concentration-dependent, with the greatest stimulation occurring a 10-30 pM rTIMP-2 in [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assays and at 20-100 pM in cell growth assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human colon (18Co) and lung (37Lu) fibroblasts showed no response to rTIMP-2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies also demonstrated that for the cell types tested, TIMP-2 alone was insufficient for a growth stimulatory response requiring, at a minimum, the presence of insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the absence of any "co-factor(s)," such as insulin, TIMP-2 treatment was inhibitory </plain></SENT>
