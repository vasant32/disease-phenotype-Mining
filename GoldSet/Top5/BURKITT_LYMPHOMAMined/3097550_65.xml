<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case the region of chromosome 8 involved has recombined with a JH region on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two sites of breakage on chromosome 8 lie within 70 base pairs (bp) of one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each joining site, sequences homologous to the signal sequences thought to be recognized by the V-D-J recombinase were identified, as were N regions </plain></SENT>
