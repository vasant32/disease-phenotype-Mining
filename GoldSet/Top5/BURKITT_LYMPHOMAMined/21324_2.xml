<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Raji lymphoid cells bind immune complexes via the C 3 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to incubation with the test serum it is necessary to block the IgG Fc receptor which would interfere with the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present modification the IgG Fc receptor is blocked with monoclonal IgG <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> proteins thereby facilitating the detection of C 3 bound immune complexes with fluoresecein-conjugated anti-light chain serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This modification is presently used in a survey of immune complexes in a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
