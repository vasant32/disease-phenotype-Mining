<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation we show that the resistance to the anti-proliferative effect of IFN class I on certain EBV-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines is connected to the presence of the EBNA-2 gene and parts of the EBNA-5 gene of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the genomic segment comprising these open reading frames into an IFN-sensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line demonstrated that it is sufficient to make cells resistant towards the antiproliferative effect of IFN class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the EBNA-2 gene seems to be correlated with the IFN-resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiviral function of IFN, as tested by inhibition by vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus (VSV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and the IFN-receptor binding are not suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the neutralization of the anti-proliferative effect of IFN-alpha is involved in the EBV-mediated immortalization of B-cells and that the anti-proliferative action of IFN class I does not necessarily recruit the same mechanism as the antiviral effect </plain></SENT>
