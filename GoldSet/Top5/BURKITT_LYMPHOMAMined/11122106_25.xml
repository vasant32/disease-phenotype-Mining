<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the activity of TRAIL has been studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines and in a limited number of different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e>, its overall activity in a large number of uniform cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumours</z:e> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the activity of TRAIL in 29 primary precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TRAIL was found to have a modest activity as it killed a maximum of 29% of ALL cells within 18 h compared with killing 75% of Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity to TRAIL did not correlate with the pattern of TRAIL receptor expression or FLIP expression, as determined by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD40 receptor, which can transduce survival signals in mature malignant B cells, was less frequently expressed on ALL cells, but incubation with an exogenous soluble CD40 ligand trimer did not rescue them from spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and did not mediate their resistance to TRAIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, although ALL cells expressed TRAIL protein, they failed to kill target Jurkat cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data delineate major biological differences between mature and precursor malignant B cells and suggest a limited therapeutic role for TRAIL as a single agent in primary B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
