<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The LCLs from HIV-seropositive patients had phenotypic, cytogenetic, and biological characteristics indistinguishable from those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LCLs obtained by infecting B cells with EBV in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LCLs from LAM patient comprised composite cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cloning analysis and cell fractionation procedures showed that, beside <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EBV-infected cells, these lines contained a malignant subset population characterized by c-myc rearrangement, abnormal karyotype, and a surface phenotype similar to that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of Ig heavy chain and c-myc oncogene loci showed that these malignant cells were the progeny of a single precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these cells had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> EBV-fused termini, a finding which indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> followed c-myc rearrangement </plain></SENT>
