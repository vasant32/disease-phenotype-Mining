<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous BMT can induce prolonged clinical remissions in some children with recurrent ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of autologous BMT in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous marrow was treated in vitro with J5 and J2 monoclonal antibodies (CD10/CD9) plus rabbit complement to purge residual ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two adults with B lineage ALL were treated with high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by infusion of J2/J5 purged autologous BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 28 years (range 18-54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 22 patients had experienced at least one relapse prior to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved complete hematologic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) in this cohort of patients was 20%, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> survivors alive and free of disease between 2.5 and 7.5 years post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age at the time of BMT was an important prognostic factor, with patients &lt; 28 years old faring much better than older individuals (DFS, 45% vs 0%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by infusion of J2/J5 purged autologous marrow is as efficacious in young adults as it is in children and is a reasonable alternative for patients who lack HLA-matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results in older adults are poor, however, and demonstrate the need for more effective transplant strategies in these individuals </plain></SENT>
