<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During B cell development, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable region (VH) genes are rearranged and expressed in a programmed manner and accumulating evidence suggests recurrent utilization of developmentally restricted VH genes in malignant B lymphoid populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used polymerase chain reaction gene amplification in conjunction with a panel of VH family-specific amplimers to directly compare the repertoire of VH region rearrangement in mature, CD5+ B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> with that in immature, CD5 B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed a diverse pattern of VH family utilization common to both disease groups in which VH regions most proximal to the IgH joining locus were preferentially rearranged relative to their family sizes with recurrent utilization of several known developmentally restricted VH genes in close to germ-line configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that biased VH family usage is independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This bias may reflect similar stages or compartments in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphopoiesis from which diverse types of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> may arise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since blast cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> do not express functional immunoglobulin, we infer that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell-associated VH family repertoire is determined through antigen-independent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
