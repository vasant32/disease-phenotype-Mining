<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the use of dielectrophoresis (DEP) to position U-937 monocytes within a non-uniform electric field, prior to electroporation (EP) for gene delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DEP positioning and EP pulsing were both accomplished using a common set of inert planar electrodes, micro-fabricated on a glass substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single-shell model of the cell's dielectric properties and finite-element modeling of the electric field distribution permitted us to predict the major features of cell positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent to which electric pulses increased the permeability of the cell membranes to fluorescent molecules and to pEGFPLuc DNA plasmids were found to depend on prior positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For a given set of pulse parameters, EP was either irreversible (resulting in cytolysis), reversible (leading to gene delivery), or not detectable, depending on where cells were positioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly demonstrate that position-dependent EP of cells in a non-uniform electric field can be controlled by DEP </plain></SENT>
