<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 108 cases 93 were HA-positive by sheep cells in at least one of their sera, while 15 were HA-negative by the same test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 280 controls false-positive HA tests were not encountered except in eight cases with the horse cell microtitre tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With one of the two slide tests at least two false-positive tests and 12 false-negative tests were also found but these sera had low titres in microtitre tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The HA life-span was found to be unexpectedly long in a few cases, sheep cell HA lasting up to 8 to 10 months and horse cell HA up to 21 to 23 months.Many false-positive tests may therefore not be true false-positives and may result from the persistence of HA following unrecognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> months before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of IM had (or developed) antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (EBV-VCA), whereas only half of the controls were EBV-VCA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis of nonspecific and specific test results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> allows the following conclusions: (1) horse cell microtitre tests and the monospot test are more sensitive than sheep cell microtitre tests and the monotest; (2) false-negative results are occasionally seen with the latter tests but not with the former; (3) more false-positive results, however, are probably seen with the former tests; and (4) specific EBV-IgM and EBV-EA antibody tests are useful in the diagnosis of selected borderline cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
