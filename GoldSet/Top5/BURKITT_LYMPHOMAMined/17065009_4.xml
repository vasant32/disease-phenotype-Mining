<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survivin gene is highly expressed in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) tissues and high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line-Daudi and it is regarded as a potential target of gene therapy for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study used a vector-based short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) technique to explore the effect of RNAi-mediated survivin gene silencing on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant plasmid survivin-shRNA was transfected into Daudi cells transiently and stably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of survivin was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transfection of survivin-shRNA, the levels of survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were significantly reduced by 64.20% (transient transfection) and 62.32% (stable transfection), respectively; The levels of survivin protein were significantly reduced by 63.50% (transient transfection) and 61.88% (stable transfection); compared with control-shRNA and PBS treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells were significantly higher in the transfection group than in the control group, respectively 21.30 +/- 2.96% (transient transfection) and 19.10 +/- 2.15% (stable transfection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was suggested that survivin could be an attractive target for new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> intervention of NHL and vector-based survivin-shRNA could effectively reduce the expression of survivin and induce cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and growth inhibition of NHL cells </plain></SENT>
