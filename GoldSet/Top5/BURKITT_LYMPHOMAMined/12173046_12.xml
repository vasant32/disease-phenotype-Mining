<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in human mismatch repair (MMR) genes are the genetic basis for certain types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSI has also been observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, but whether these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> are associated with MMR deficiency is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using both biochemical and genetic approaches, this study analysed MMR proficiency in 11 cell lines derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and demonstrated that six out of seven hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines with MSI were defective in strand-specific MMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro complementation experiments, using characterized MMR mutant extracts or purified proteins, showed that these hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells were defective in either hMutS(alpha) (a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH6) or hMutL(alpha) (a heterodimer of hMLH1 and hPMS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cell lines deficient in hMutS(alpha) showed large deletions or point mutations in hMSH2, while those deficient in hMutL(alpha) exhibited point mutations in hMLH1 or a lack of expression of hPMS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> with MSI are also associated with MMR deficiency, and that the cause of MMR deficiency in these cell lines is due to a defective MutS(alpha) or MutL(alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also report here, for the first time, that an MSI-positive cell line derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is proficient in MMR </plain></SENT>
