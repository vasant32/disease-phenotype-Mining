<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established two human plasma cell lines, FR4 and AD3, from ascitic fluid in a patient with IgA k <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (PC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant amylase production was found in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both AD3 and FR4 were free of Epstein-Barr virus, and both produced Ig A k in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They produced amylase of the salivary type in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by the demonstration of amylase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> comigrating with salivary gland <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cell lines commonly had unusual chromosomal abnormalities der(14)t(8;14) and dic(8)t(1;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD3 had additional chromosomal abnormalities compared with FR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that AD3 is a subline of FR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The oncogene c-myc is rearranged in most case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, neither rearrangement nor amplification of the c-myc allele was detected in our PC lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These lines expressed c-myc of 2.4 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no structural changes in the amylase genes of AD3 and FR4 detectable with Southern blotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As these lines were authentic PC lines, they would be useful for the future study of the relationship between the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> and the rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> aberration, amylase production </plain></SENT>
