<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single measurements on a panel of 15 healthy individuals demonstrate that the frequency varies over a wide range from 1-50 per 10(6) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat measurements over 1-3.5 years on several individuals whose frequencies varied over a 10-fold range showed that the variation does not represent the fluctuation in the frequency that can occur within an individual; rather, the frequencies are specific to the individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency within an individual measured over time is stable and contributes less than 10% to the variance seen in the whole population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These measurements suggest that the level of EBV-infected B cells is tightly regulated and we propose that the same homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells also regulate B cells latently infected with EBV </plain></SENT>
