<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classically, the immunophenotype of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been considered to be the germinal center type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most reports, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are reported to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1-negative. <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1 expression is seen in plasma cells and in a small fraction of B cells located in the light zone of germinal centers corresponding to the final step of intra-germinal center B-cell differentiation, and in activated T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1 expression may denote the final step of intra-germinal center B-cell differentiation at the centrocyte stage, as well as the subsequent steps of B-cell maturation toward plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center B cells, in which the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1 and bcl-6 are mutually exclusive, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in approximately 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> show coexpression of bcl-6, suggesting that the expression of these proteins may be deregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, including 19 associated with HIV, were reported in one of the few studies in the literature; 2 of these cases showed occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1-positive cells, less than the 20% cutoff for positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied 222 cases of well-characterized Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the classic phenotype and C-MYC translocation and found 90 cases (40.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> 1 nuclear expression, suggesting a late germinal center stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
