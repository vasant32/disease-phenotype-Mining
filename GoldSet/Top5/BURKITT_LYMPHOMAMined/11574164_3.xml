<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene was cloned by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach based on a cDNA clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting hzfr sequence is 3393 base pairs in length coding for a protein of 1057 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence alignments between hzfr and zfr reveal an identity of 92% on the nucleotide level and an identity of 96.4% on the amino acid level, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on Southern blot data hzfr can be addressed as a single copy gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue-specific expression was determined by semi-quantitative PCR of normalized cDNA populations from various human tissues with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highest levels of transcripts were found in brain. hzfr transcripts could not be detected in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
