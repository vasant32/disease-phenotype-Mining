<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is among the environmental factors that are suspected of predisposing to SLE, based on the characteristics of EBV itself and on sequence homologies between autoantigens and EBV antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher titers of anti-EBV antibodies and increased EBV seroconversion rates have been observed in SLE patients as compared with healthy control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serologic responses do not directly reflect EBV status within the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clarification of the precise status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in SLE patients would help to improve our understanding of the role played by EBV in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study we determined EBV types in SLE patients (n = 66) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individual (n = 63) by direct PCR analysis of mouthwash samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared EBV load in blood between SLE patients (n = 24) and healthy control individuals (n = 29) using semiquantitative PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and EBV type distribution were similar between adult SLE patients and healthy control individuals (98.5% versus 94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the EBV burden in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was over 15-fold greater in SLE patients than in healthy control individuals (mean +/- standard deviation: 463 +/- 570 EBV genome copies/3 microg PBMC DNA versus 30 +/- 29 EBV genome copies/3 microg PBMC DNA; P = 0.001), suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> is abnormally regulated in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abnormally increased proportion of EBV-infected B cells in the SLE patients may contribute to enhanced autoantibody production in this disease </plain></SENT>
