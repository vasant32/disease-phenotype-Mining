<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophoretic analysis of DNA has evidenced a different pattern of DNA fragment size produced by DNase I in nuclei isolated from control cells compared to interferon-treated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This feature is supported by a different recovery of acid soluble chromatin and is accompanied by modifications of in vitro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis along with initiation and elongation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No changes have been evidenced in nuclei isolated from Daudi-resistant cells under the same experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data might be interpreted as a transient modulation, induced by interferon, of chromatin structure in terms of chromatin condensation which, in turn, activates the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis after the transduction into the nucleus of the interferon-generated signals </plain></SENT>
