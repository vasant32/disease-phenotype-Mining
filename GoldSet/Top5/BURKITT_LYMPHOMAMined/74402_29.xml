<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least 13% of the total Namalva interferon activity possessed the F antigenic determinant found on human interferon derived from fibroblast cultures, while the bulk of the Namalva interferon activity had the Le antigenic determinant characteristic for human leukocyte interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The separated Le and F subspecies of Namalva interferon differed in the degree of their heterospecific activities on bovine cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Le moiety resembled crude leukocyte interferon in that it was highly active in bovine cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The F component of Namalva interferon showed a lower degree of activity in bovine cells, thus resembling crude fibroblast interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When analysed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and by isoelectric focusing, crude Namalva interferon qualitatively resembled crude leukocyte interferon </plain></SENT>
