<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was originally produced by immunizing mice with nuclei of cultured cells from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with progressive refractory B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were treated with 131I-labelled Lym-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 131I Lym-I produced complete or partial remissions in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity did not occur or was mild in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant complications included two instances of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> secondary to necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one instance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human antimouse antibodies occurred in only 2 patients after multiple injections of Lym-I antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This experience was in contrast to treatment of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with unconjugated Lym-I alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unconjugated Lym-I also caused no significant toxicity but was less effective than 131I Lym-I </plain></SENT>
