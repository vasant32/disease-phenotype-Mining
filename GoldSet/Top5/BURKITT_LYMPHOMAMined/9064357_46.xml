<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reactivation of this herpesvirus during immunosuppression is often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These considerations led us to analyze the early events that occur after exposure of the immune system to EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strong major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-dependent but not MHC-restricted, T cell proliferation was observed in vitro in response to autologous, lytically infected EBV-transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By measuring the appearance of the early activation marker CD69 on individual T cell V beta subsets, we could demonstrate selective activation of human V beta 13- T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed with murine T cell hybridomas expressing various human BV genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While EBV- Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were nonstimulatory, they induced V beta-restricted T cell activation after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV specific activation was also demonstrated in cord blood cells, excluding a recall-antigen response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the characteristics of a superantigen-stimulated response are seen, indicating that induction of the EBV lytic cycle is associated with the expression of a superantigen in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A model is presented proposing a role for the superantigen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, latency, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
