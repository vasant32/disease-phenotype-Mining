<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, making it a potentially important target for immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this promise has not been realized, because an endogenously processed MHC class I-restricted T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> remains to be identified, and relatively little is known about MHC class II-restricted helper <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we identify a T-cell <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> derived from EBNA1 that is recognized by CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, EBNA1-specific, HLA-DP3-restricted CD4(+) T cells are capable of recognizing MHC class II-matched Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells loaded with the purified EBNA1 protein, as well as target cells transfected with Ii-EBNA1 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These new findings demonstrate that EBNA1 is processed endogenously and presented to T cells by MHC class II molecules, and, hence, may be useful to incorporate into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> vaccines to enhance antitumor immunity against EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
