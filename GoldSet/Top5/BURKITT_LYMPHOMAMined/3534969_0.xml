<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dose of most <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic agents</z:chebi> is limited by the toxicity to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The availability of marrow for transplantation (allogenic, syngenic or autologous), and the capability of reconstituting hematopoietic function, makes it possible to administer chemoradiotherapy in supralethal doses in an effort to kill a greater fraction of the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total Body Irradiation is used both to eradicate the malignant cells and to suppress host immune reactivity enough to prevent rejection of allogenic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transplanted allogenic marrow can also exert an antitumor effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A survey of radiobiological studies undertaken is presented and preliminary results of a series of patients treated with TBI at ISSR are discussed </plain></SENT>
