<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene-expression microarray analysis of 48 cell lines derived from patients with different B-NHLs delineated 20 homozygous deletions at 7 chromosome areas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which contained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further investigation revealed that only a fraction of primary biopsies presented inactivation of these genes by point mutation or intragenic deletion, but instead some of them were frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, the pattern of genetic and epigenetic inactivation differed among B-NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the P53-inducible PIG7/LITAF was silenced by homozygous deletion in primary mediastinal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and by promoter hypermethylation in germinal center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the proapoptotic BIM gene presented homozygous deletion in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and promoter hypermethylation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the proapoptotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> was mutated and preferentially silenced in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and INK4c/P18 was silenced by biallelic mutation in mantle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
