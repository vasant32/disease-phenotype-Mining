<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A protocol was designed to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients with mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with the aims of comparing the response to therapy and survival with regards to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-three adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy, survival and toxicity were evaluated according to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 15-74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in CR rates between HIV-negative (77%) and HIV-positive patients (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only age &gt; 60 years was associated with a lower CR rate (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.04-0.81, p=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival (OS) probability was 51% (95%CI, 38%-64%) for the 53 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OS of HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients did not significantly differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only age &gt; 60 years was associated with a shorter OS (OR 5.1, 95%CI 2.0-12.7, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2-year disease free survival (DFS) for the 40 patients achieving CR was 60% (95%CI, 45%-75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; 60 years was the only identified factor associated with a shorter DFS (OR 5.2, 95%CI 1.4-20, p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of intensive strategies in adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also shows the feasibility of these strategies in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> with comparable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Advanced age proved to be the main adverse prognostic factor for response to therapy and survival </plain></SENT>
