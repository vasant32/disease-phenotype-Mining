<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now provide evidence implicating metabolic inactivation in the resistance of human Burkitt's (Daudi) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to BLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and human head and neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (A-253) cells grown (s.c.) in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were found to be resistant and sensitive to BLM treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 1 h of s.c. injection of [3H]BLM A2, Daudi xenografts accumulated less BLM and metabolized this drug to a much greater extent than did A-253 xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BLM-resistant Daudi xenografts metabolized BLM A2 to at least 6 metabolites and only a small proportion of the drug remained as unmetabolized BLM A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the BLM-sensitive A-253 xenografts, however, BLM A2 remained the major component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of BLM A2 with Daudi cytosolic fractions resulted in a complex mixture of metabolites similar to that formed by Daudi xenografts in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This BLM metabolite mixture was biologically inactive in plasmid DNA degradation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of mice bearing Daudi xenografts with an inhibitor of BLM hydrolase, L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)<z:chebi fb="70" ids="37808">butane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi>), prior to [3H]BLM A2 treatment did not affect the amount of BLM accumulated but inhibited BLM A2 metabolism in the xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30270">E-64</z:chebi> alone did not inhibit the growth of Daudi xenografts, it potentiated the antitumor activity of BLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> resist BLM by metabolically inactivating it and that inhibition of BLM metabolism in vivo enhances the antitumor activity of BLM and hence overcomes resistance </plain></SENT>
