<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> mixture did not increase IgM production by the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line NAT-30, IgG production by the human B lymphoblastoid cell line HMy-2, and IgE production by the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line U266 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin production-stimulating activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> mixture was inactivated by trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, confocal laser microscopic analysis had shown that HB4C5 cells incorporated a lot of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> but other cell lines did not incorporate it as much </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These facts strongly suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acts as an immunoglobulin production-stimulating factor (IPSF) after internalization into the human B cell lines and the native structure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> is required for the IPSF activity </plain></SENT>
