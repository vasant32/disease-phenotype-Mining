<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NFkBis constitutively activated in a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its role in primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has not been fully explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing to define the role of NFkB in growth and survival of PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NFkB activity by Bay11-7085 resulted in decreased expression of p65 in the nuclear compartment as detected by EMSA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, Bay11-7085 treatment caused de-phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream targets suggesting a cross-talk between NFkB and the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, treatment of PEL cells with Bay11-7085 led to inhibition of cell viability and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar apoptotic effects were found when p65 was knocked down using specific small interference <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, co-treatment of PEL cells with suboptimal doses of Bay11-7085 and LY294002 led to synergistic apoptotic responses in PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These data support a strong biological-link between NFkB and the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway in the modulation of anti-apoptotic effects in PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Synergistic targeting of these pathways using NFKB- and PI3-kinase/AKT-inhibitors may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of PEL and possibly other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with constitutive activation of these pathways </plain></SENT>
