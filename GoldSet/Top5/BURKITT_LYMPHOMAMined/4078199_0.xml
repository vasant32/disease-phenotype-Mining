<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We determined the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> content for two different Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (EW 36 and CA 46) after transfer to new media for 7 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aliquots of the cell culture were washed and the cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation and lysed with distilled water with and without the addition of 0.25% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi> permitted the detection of between 8 and 40% more <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increased <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> liberated by the addition of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33336">lanthanum</z:chebi> was calculated as the "bound" <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that the total <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> is inversely related and the bound <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> directly related to the age of the cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a decrease of lymphocyte <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> content and an increase in the percentage of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> bound for these two cell lines with increasing age of the cell culture </plain></SENT>
