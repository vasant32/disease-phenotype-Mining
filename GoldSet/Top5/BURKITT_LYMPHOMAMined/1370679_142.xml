<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Engagement of the CD3/T cell antigen receptor complex on small, resting T cells is insufficient to trigger cell-mediated cytotoxicity or to induce a proliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have used genetic transfection to demonstrate that interaction of the B7-BB1 B cell activation antigen with the CD28 T cell differentiation antigen costimulates cell-mediated cytotoxicity and proliferation initiated by either anti-CD2 or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a B7-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line that fails to stimulate an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response is rendered a potent stimulator after transfection with B7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mixed leukocyte reaction proliferative response against the B7 transfectant is inhibited by either anti-CD28 or B7 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that freshly isolated small, resting human T cells can mediate anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 mAb-redirected cytotoxicity against a murine Fc receptor-bearing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytoma</z:mpath> transfected with human B7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These preexisting cytotoxic T lymphocytes in peripheral blood are present in both the CD4 and CD8 subsets, but are preferentially within the CD45RO+ "memory" population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While small, resting T cells apparently require costimulation by CD28/B7 interactions, this requirement is lost after T cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD3 initiates a cytotoxic response mediated by in vitro cultured T cell clones in the absence of B7 ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The existence of functional cytolytic T cells in the small, resting T cell population may be advantageous in facilitating rapid responses to immune challenge </plain></SENT>
