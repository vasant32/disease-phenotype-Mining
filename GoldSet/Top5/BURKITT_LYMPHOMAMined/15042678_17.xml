<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received 18 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic cranial radiation (2400 centigrays) and 12 doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy were administered to the first cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subsequent cohort received the same therapy, with the exceptions that intrathecal therapy was reduced to six doses and radiotherapy was administered only to high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up durations were 6.8 years in Cohort 1 and 4.1 years in Cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three occurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e>, 2 severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e>, 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> were documented in the first cohort of 52 patients (Cohort 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent cohort of 40 patients (Cohort 2), none of these occurrences were observed, and patients experienced less neurologic toxicity overall (61% vs. 26%; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Responses were similar, and the 3-year event-free survival rate was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.65) for Cohort 1 and 0.45 (0.29-0.60) for Cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive, short-duration chemotherapy with less intensive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis led to control at this sanctuary site with little neurotoxicity and may be curative for adults with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
