<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a core repertoire of oncogenic mechanisms is widely conserved between various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, the constellation of pathway activities can vary even in patients with the same malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modern molecularly targeted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs intervene in cell signaling compensating for pathway deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence characterizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with respect to pathway activation will become crucial for treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we have used semi-supervised machine learning methodology to generate signatures of eight oncogene-inducible pathways, which are conserved across epithelial and lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We combined them to patterns of pathway activity called <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAPs</z:mp> for pathway activation patterns and searched for them in 220 morphologically, immunohistochemically and genetically well-characterized mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including 134 cases with clinical data available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which was characterized by a unique pattern, the <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAPs</z:mp> identified four distinct groups of mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> across independent gene expression studies with distinct biological characteristics, genetic aberrations and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirmed our findings through cross-platform analysis in an independent data set of 303 mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
