<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An assay for circulating immune complexes is described which uses radiolabelled bovine conglutinin as ligand and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> precipitation as the technique for separating bound ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique is simple to perform and gives good sensitivity detecting artificial immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its use in detecting complexes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is described and it is compared with the Clq binding assay also performed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the simultaneous performance of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> assays using radiolabelled Clq and radiolabelled conglutinin may be an advantageous method for screening sera for the presence of immune complexes </plain></SENT>
