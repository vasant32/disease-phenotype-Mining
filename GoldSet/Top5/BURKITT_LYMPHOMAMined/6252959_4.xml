<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repair was demonstrated by the induction of repair synthesis and by the disappearance of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-induced single-strand breaks and/or alkaline-labile sites in DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-induced repair patch size, based on the density shift induced in DNA by extensive shear after incubation of treated cells in medium with bromodeoxyuridine or by calculation from the extent of restoration of DNA sedimentation profiles in alkaline <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradients and the amount of repair synthesis measured by the BND cellulose method, indicated that only a few <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were inserted per repaired region </plain></SENT>
