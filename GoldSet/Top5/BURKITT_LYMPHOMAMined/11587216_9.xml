<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to reciprocal t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation involving c-myc and IgH loci, we identified a t(7;8;14)(q11.2;q24;q32) translocation in CA 46 cells and t(8;14;18)(q24;q32;q23) in ST486 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both rearrangements were not previously described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and resulted in transposition of myc sequences in a new genomic configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several DNA imbalances mapped by CGH at the same sites in both lines, may reflect recurrent genomic changes that are relevant to pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the tumorigenicity of these lines by injecting cells intraperitoneally in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two separate experiments, CA46 cells produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> 2 weeks after cell inoculation while ST486 cells induced only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> after a long latency period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 involving variable bands but always band 1q23 is the second most common alteration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and is known to be associated with aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplication of the bands 1q23-24 commonly observed in EBV-negative lines was identified only in highly tumorigenic CA46 cells suggesting that this region harbor gene(s) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell invasiveness </plain></SENT>
