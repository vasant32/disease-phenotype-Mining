<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that a 2.7-kilobase-pair rearranged Epstein-Barr virus DNA fragment of this gene (BamHI fragment WZhet) induced transient expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replicative antigens and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> when it was transfected into a somatic cell hybrid, which was derived from the fusion of an epithelial line cell with a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that this rearranged WZhet fragment, when introduced stably into lymphoblastoid cells, will activate expression of the complete <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replicative cycle in 1-10% of the lymphoblastoid cells, leading to production of biologically active virions that can immortalize primary lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfected plasmid appears to be regulated in a manner analogous to the complete Epstein-Barr virus genome </plain></SENT>
