<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalized cells and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells have a completely different growth pattern and phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV immortalized cells express a set of 11 <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes to accommodate B cell activation and proliferation, whereas EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells highly express the c-myc oncogene that is activated through translocation into 1 of the immunoglobulin loci and EBNA1 as the only <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a primary human B cell line conditionally immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus in which the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene program responsible for the induction of proliferation can be switched on and off by the addition or withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> (cell line EREB2-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Starting from this cell line we have generated 2 daughter cell lines that proliferate in a c-myc dependent fashion, 1 with a highly active exogenous c-myc gene (cell line A1) and 1 with a regulatable c-myc gene that can be switched on by withdrawal and switched off by addition of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> (cell line P493-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the 3 cell lines has allowed us to dissect the contribution of c-myc and EBV genes to the regulation of the growth pattern and expression of cell surface molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that MYC and EBNA2 (and their respective target genes) have opposing effects on the expression of several surface markers involved in B cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that MYC contributes to the phenotype of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by upregulating CD10 and CD38 and downregulating activation markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the cells is determined on one hand by the absence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene products EBNA2 and LMP1 that mediate the phenotype of activated lymphoblasts and to a lesser extent by an active contribution of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
