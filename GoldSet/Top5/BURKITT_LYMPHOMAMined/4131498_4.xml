<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 90 aspirates where histology was also available there was agreement between histological and cytological diagnosis in 81 (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This percentage was identical when only previously undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were considered (60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 aspirates no cells were obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in which a diagnosis was made histologically and in 5 there was disagreement with histology, either regarding the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique of fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is simple, rapid, safe and reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is particularly valuable when emergency treatment is required, necessitating a very rapid diagnosis, or when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> is entirely intra-abdominal and the patient is unfit for laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeat aspirates may be performed to assess progress following treatment, or multiple suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> sites may be aspirated to assist staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The technique may be used to confirm the presence of relapsing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> cytology may prove valuable as a further dimension in the interpretation of histological sections in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumours</z:e>, and in some circumstances may be sufficient in itself to establish a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
