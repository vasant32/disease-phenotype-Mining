<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SR-91 is a natural killer (NK)-resistant leukemic cell line expressing a low level of ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment of SR-91 cells with TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, increased both ICAM-1 (CD54) expression on SR-91 cells and binding to the human NK cell line NK-92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only TNF-alpha-treated SR-91 cells became sensitive to killing by NK-92 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased binding induced by both cytokines and the TNF-alpha-induced sensitivity of SR-91 cells to NK-92 cell killing were abrogated by anti-LFA-1 mAb as well as by a combination of antibodies against the three ligands of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), ICAM-1 (CD54), ICAM-2 (CD102) and ICAM-3 (CD50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicated that LFA-1 interaction with the three ICAMs on SR-91 cells is essential for effector-target cell binding (which is a prerequisite for subsequent target cell lysis), but is insufficient to render the SR-91 cells sensitive to killing by NK-92 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, but not IFN-gamma also induced the activation of LFA-1, CD44 and beta1 integrins on SR-91 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations we propose that the differential effect of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma could be related to the activation of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules on the surface of SR-91 cells by TNF-alpha that, upon interaction with their counter-receptors on NK-92 cells, lead to the activation of the NK-92 cells </plain></SENT>
