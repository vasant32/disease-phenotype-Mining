<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients at very high risk for TLS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> can be identified based on the level of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and urine output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prospective use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), in addition to conventional management to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis, in three children with advanced abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in two children with high white blood cell count T-cell ALL who were at very high risk based on LDH and urine output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of very high-risk patients, the LDH ratio (value at diagnosis/upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) ranged from 0.88 to 10.3 and urine output from 0.13 to 4.7 ml/kg per hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVVH was begun at a mean time of 10.5 h before chemotherapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Full-dose induction chemotherapy was begun within 24 h of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After beginning CVVH, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> levels decreased 46% prior to beginning chemotherapy and decreased to a mean of 4.2 mg/dl 24 h after chemotherapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the five patients had either no change or a drop in the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patient one, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen peaked at 58 mg/dl, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> at 4.7 mg/dl 6 days after beginning chemotherapy with a subsequent return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, CVVH prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> secondary to TLS in 80% of these very high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the fifth patient, CVVH allowed full-dose chemotherapy to continue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prospective use of CVVH could potentially decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with induction chemotherapy in very high-risk patients with a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
