<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we show that pretreatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines expressing the c-met protooncogene with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) protects them from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by DNA damaging agents commonly used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This protection was observed in assays based on morphological assessment of apoptotic cells and DNA fragmentation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protection was dose- and time-dependent -- maximal protection requiring pre-incubation with 100 ng/ml HGF for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting analysis and flow cytometric studies revealed that HGF inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced decreases in the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-X(L), and to a lesser extent Bcl-2, without inducing changes in the pro-apoptotic Bax protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, these studies suggest that the accumulation of HGF within the microenvironment of neoplastic cells may contribute to the development of a chemoresistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
