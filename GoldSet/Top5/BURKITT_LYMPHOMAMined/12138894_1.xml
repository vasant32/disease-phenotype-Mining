<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in the intracellular signal transduction process that causes antibody-induced apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in B-cells is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously established a B-cell line (MBC-1) from a patient with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the leukemic stage that demonstrated the typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when treated with anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This antibody-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was partially inhibited by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30742">ethyleneglycol</z:chebi>-bis-tetraacetic acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin-D</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FK506, an immunosupressive agent and calcineurin inhibitor, also partially rescued the anti-IgM antibody-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of MBC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that the calcium signaling pathway, which leads to a change in gene expression, plays an important role in anti-IgM-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MBC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric measurement of the cytosolic free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) showed that nontoxic concentrations of 4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> IP) increased [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i more than did the anti-IgM antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A brief <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> spike was observed on anti-IgM antibody treatment, but a gradual increase and decrease were observed when the cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> IP at a nontoxic concentration of 1 microg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that interpretations differ for the 2 patterns of calcium signaling and that the brief spiked elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> produces distinct biological and cellular responses compared to the gradual increase and decrease of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> plays a significant role as a multifunctional second messenger providing specific information to the nucleus in anti-IgM antibody-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MBC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
