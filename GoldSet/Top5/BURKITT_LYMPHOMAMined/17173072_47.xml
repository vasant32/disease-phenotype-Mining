<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BIC is a primary microRNA (pri-miR-155) that can be processed to mature miR-155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show the crucial involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the regulation of BIC expression upon B-cell receptor triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, Northern blot analysis did not reveal any miR-155 expression upon induction of BIC expression in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Ramos cell line, whereas other microRNAs were clearly detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of BIC in Ramos and HEK293 cells resulted in miR-155 expression in HEK293, but not in Ramos cells, suggesting a specific block of BIC to miR-155 processing in Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In line with the results obtained with Ramos, lack of miR-155 expression after induction of BIC expression was also observed in other Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, indicating a generic and specific blockade in the processing of BIC in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, induction of BIC expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsillar B cells resulted in very high levels of miR-155 expression and induction of BIC expression in Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also resulted in elevated levels of miR-155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence for two levels of regulation for mature miR-155 expression: one at the transcriptional level involving PKC and NF-kappaB, and one at the processing level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells not only express low levels of BIC, but also prevent processing of BIC via an, as yet, unknown mechanism </plain></SENT>
