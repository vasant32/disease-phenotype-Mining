<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RA-induced myeloid differentiation and G1/G0 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells is known to require the activation of the RARalpha and RXR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> receptors, as well as activation of the MAPK, ERK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activation of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1 (blr1) gene occurs early during RA-induced differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells and requires these same three activating processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> ligands that activate either the RARalpha or the RXR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> receptors revealed that blr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction was detectable only when both RARalpha and RXR were activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither the RARalpha nor RXR selective ligands alone induced expression of blr1, but the combination of the two ligands induced the expression of blr1 to the same extent as RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MAPKK (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, was used to determine whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) activation was necessary for induction of blr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PD98059 inhibited induced blr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, due to RA or activated RARalpha plus RXR ligands, indicating that ERK2 activation is necessary for blr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that ectopic expression of blr1 also caused increased MAPK activation, in particular ERK2, and subsequently accelerated RA-induced differentiation and G1/G0 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of ERK2 activation inhibited differentiation of blr1 transfectants, suggesting that the accelerated differentiation reflected blr1-enhanced ERK2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present data also demonstrate that ectopic expression of blr1 increased JNK/SAPK activity, but JNK/ SAPK activation was not needed for accelerated RA-induced differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show that the signals known to be required for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 differentiation, activated RARalpha, RXR, and ERK2, are necessary for blr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
