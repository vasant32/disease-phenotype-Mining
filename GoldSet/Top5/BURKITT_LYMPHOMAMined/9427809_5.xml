<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study has used a panel of 23 monoclonal antibodies to IgM and 4 to IgD in order to probe parameters influencing sIg-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in an IgM/IgD-expressing Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No direct correlation was observed between the capacity of the different anti-mu to drive cells into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and either their domain specificity or their affinity for sIgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a direct correlation between the functional outcome and the ability of the monoclonal antibodies to elicit a rise in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to occur, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response had to attain a threshold value of approximately 100 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A direct role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in the delivery of the apoptotic signal was demonstrated using thapsigargin to raise intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antigen receptor ligation was linked to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> increases by tyrosine kinases as revealed by direct analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the effects of selective protein tyrosine kinase-inhibiting tyrphostins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal a central role for the antigen receptor-generated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signal in driving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and stresses the need to use a panel of reagents when probing function with presumed ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
