<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic contribution of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-LP protein to B-cell immortalization remains an enigma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies have indicated that EBNA-LP may contribute to immortalization by enhancing EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation of the LMP-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into the potential role EBNA-LP has in EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization, we asked whether it is a global or gene-specific coactivator of EBNA2 and whether coactivation requires interaction between these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, we found that EBNA-LP strongly coactivated EBNA2 stimulation of LMP-1 and LMP2B <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, which are expressed from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> divergent promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> LMP2A gene and cellular CD21 and Hes-1 genes were induced by EBNA2 but showed no further induction after EBNA-LP coexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that EBNA-LP did not stably interact with EBNA2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays, even though the conditions were adequate to observe specific interactions between EBNA2 and its cellular cofactor, CBF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colocalization between EBNA2 and EBNA-LP was not detectable in EBV-transformed cell lines or transfected type I Burkitt's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, no significant interactions between EBNA2 and EBNA-LP were found with mammalian two-hybrid assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From this data, we conclude that EBNA-LP is not a global coactivator of EBNA2 targets, but it preferentially coactivates EBNA2 stimulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> divergent promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While this may require specific transient interactions between these proteins that only occur in the context of the divergent promoter, our data strongly suggest that EBNA-LP also cooperates with EBNA2 through mechanisms that do not require direct or indirect complex formation between these proteins </plain></SENT>
