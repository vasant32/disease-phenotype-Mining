<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The monomeric laminin receptor, a 67-kd high-affinity laminin-binding protein, is expressed by a variety of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression and abnormal surface distribution of this receptor have been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells where it appears to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported the existence of an association between laminin receptor overexpression by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cells and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) bearing gammadelta T-cell receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gammadelta(+) lymphocytes represents a sizable fraction of the TILs in approximately one fourth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancers</z:e> analyzed thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether gammadelta(+) TILs might participate in the immune response against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> through recognition of monomeric laminin receptors expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells from 11 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens exhibiting sizable gammadelta(+) T-cell infiltrates and from 11 other specimens infiltrated predominantly by lymphocytes bearing alphabeta(+) T-cell receptors were analyzed for expression of the monomeric laminin receptor by use of the monoclonal antibody (MAb) MLuC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gammadalta TILs and chibeta+ TILs derived from four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were each examined for cytotoxic activity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> target cells by use of a standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> cell lines expressing different levels of surface monomeric laminin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of MAbs directed against the laminin receptor (i.e., MLuC5) or against gammadelta T-cell receptors (i.e., TigammaA and A13) as well as laminin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> known to bind to the laminin receptor to inhibit TIL-mediated target cells lysis was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed that the association between overexpression of the monomeric laminin receptor by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> cells and the presence of gammadeltadelta+ TILs is statistically significant (two sided P = .003; Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also observed a relationship between the levels of laminin receptor expression on cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cells and their susceptibility to specific lysis by gammadelta(+), but not alphabeta+, TILs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This specific cell killing was not T-cell receptor mediated, but it was inhibited by addition of the anti-monomeric laminin receptor MAb MLuC5 and by a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to amino acids 2091-2108 of the laminin A chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate gammadelta(+) TILs localized at human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> sites can kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in a process that involves interaction with the monomeric laminin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The infiltration of gammadelta(+) TILs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo> sites may represent a first line of defense against cells undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
