<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CD40 antigen provides a potent activation and survival signal to B lymphocytes when it is engaged by its T cell ligand (CD40L, gp39) or cross-linked by anti-CD40 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we use human tonsillar B cells and the Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell line, which serves as a model for human germinal center B lymphocytes, to study the effectors of Apo-1/Fas expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that Apo-1/Fas expression was upregulated on both malignant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B lymphocytes after CD40 ligation induced by (a) cognate T helper-B cell interaction mediated by microbial superantigen (SAg); (b) contact-dependent interaction with CD40L+, but not CD40L- Jurkat mutant T cell clones; and (c) monoclonal anti-CD40, but not any of a panel of control antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced B cell Fas/Apo-1 expression is functionally significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coculture of Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line cells with irradiated SAg-reactive CD4+ T cells with SAg or CD40L+ Jurkat T cells results in B cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, evidenced by reduced cell viability and DNA laddering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This process is augmented by the addition of anti-Apo-1/Fas monoclonal antibody, consistent with an acquired susceptibility to Apo-1/Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support an immunoregulatory pathway in which seemingly contradictory signals involving the B cell proliferation/survival antigen CD40, as well as the Apo-1/Fas molecule, which mediates programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of lymphocytes, are linked in the process of human B cell activation </plain></SENT>
