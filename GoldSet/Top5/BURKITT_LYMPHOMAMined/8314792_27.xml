<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a transcriptional activator that binds to sequences in the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter and is thought to be largely responsible for the T cell-specific inducibility of IL-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that specific NFAT binding activity could also be induced in human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B cell NFAT complex, however, was not functional, since it failed to activate transcription from an NFAT-driven <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Competition with an AP-1 motif or with anti-Jun and anti-Fos antibodies abolished binding to the NFAT motif in both T and B cells, indicating that Jun and Fos are critical for NFAT complex formation in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts, full-length, but not truncated, Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an NFAT complex, indicating the presence of a constitutively expressed nuclear factor(s) in B and T cells necessary for the formation of the NFAT complex in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An NFAT oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the 5' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi>-rich part of the NFAT sequence failed to form a complex and to compete with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> motif for NFAT complex formation in both T and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose a model whereby a core NFAT complex consisting of Jun, Fos, and a constitutive nuclear factor is formed in both T and B cells, but an additional factor and/or post-translational modification of a factor, missing in B cells, might be required for transactivation by NFAT </plain></SENT>
