<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum total LDH activity correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden as determined by clinical staging at presentation or clinical stage of the disease process ("disease status") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> lysis by chemotherapy considerably increased the serum total LDH activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the LDH isoenzyme pattern, the largest relative increases were found with LDH3 and LDH4, whereas the highest isoenzyme activities occurred with LDH2 and LDH3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the total and isoenzyme LDH activities are helpful to evaluate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and prognosis in patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
