<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the rearranged third complementarity-determining-region (CDR-III) of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) was used as a surrogate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA obtained from marrows at diagnosis was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a pair of consensus primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 rounds of DNA amplification and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel separation, the nucleotide sequences of 87.5% (21/24) consecutive children with B-lineage ALL were obtained by automated sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were between 1-4 rearrangements per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the J5 and J6 joining regions were preferentially used, the rearranged sequences were unique for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 sequences obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oligoprobes to the DNJ region were constructed and quantitation in 7 patients showed a detection sensitivity of 1 leukaemic cell in 10(4) to 10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells compared to 3 in 100 using conventional morphological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial bone marrow showed progressive decrease in the quantity of leukaemic cells, and no leukaemic sequences were detected during cessation of therapy in 4/7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, absconded treatment and eventually relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the need to eliminate the leukaemic clones below <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection levels before the end of therapy at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study describes a novel, simplified and sensitive method of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection in childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
