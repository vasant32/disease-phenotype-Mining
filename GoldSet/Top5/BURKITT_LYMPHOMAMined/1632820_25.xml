<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dolastatin 15, a seven-subunit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi> derived from Dolabella auricularia, is a potent antimitotic agent structurally related to the antitubulin agent dolastatin 10, a five-subunit <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> obtained from the same organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared dolastatin 15 with dolastatin 10 for its effects on cells grown in culture and on biochemical properties of tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC50 values for cell growth were obtained for dolastatin 15 with L1210 murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) cells (3, 3, and 5 nM with the three cell lines, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For dolastatin 10, IC50 values of 0.4 and 0.5 nM were obtained with the L1210 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At toxic concentrations dolastatin 15 caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to arrest in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells both dolastatin 15 and dolastatin 10 caused moderate loss of microtubules at the IC50 values and complete disappearance of microtubules at concentrations 10-fold higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite its potency and the loss of microtubules in treated cells, the interaction of dolastatin 15 with tubulin in vitro was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its IC50 value for inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced polymerization of tubulin was 23 microM, as compared to values of 1.2 microM for dolastatin 10 and 1.5 microM for vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dolastatin 10 noncompetitively inhibits the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> to tubulin, inhibits nucleotide exchange, stabilizes the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> binding activity of tubulin, and inhibits tubulin-dependent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> hydrolysis (Bai et al., Biochem Pharmacol 39: 1941-1949, 1990; Bai et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>J Biol Chem 265: 17141-17149, 1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only the latter reaction was inhibited by dolastatin 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, its structural similarity to dolastatin 10 indicates that dolastatin 15 may bind weakly in the "vinca domain" of tubulin (a region of the protein we postulate to be physically close to but not identical with the specific binding site of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27288">vinca alkaloids</z:chebi> and maytansinoids), presumably in the same site as dolastatin 10 (the "<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> site") </plain></SENT>
