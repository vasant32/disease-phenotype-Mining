<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The size of the protein is consistent with the potential coding region predicted from the c-myc nucleotide sequence, and is the same for malignant cells carrying either a rearranged or an unrearranged c-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because c-myc transcripts are expressed at higher levels in malignant than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, it appears that an increased level of the c-myc protein rather than a change in the gene product is the relevant factor in determining transformation </plain></SENT>
