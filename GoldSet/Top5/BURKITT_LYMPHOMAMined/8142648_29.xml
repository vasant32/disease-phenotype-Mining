<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the establishment of two permanent Simian virus 40-transformed human stromal cell lines, designated L87/4 and L88/5, derived from the bone marrow of a hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines show a fibroblastoid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and do not express hematopoietic cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L87/4 but not L88/5 expresses the macrophage marker CD68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most remarkable feature of these new stromal cell lines is their ability to persist as growth-arrested adherent feeder cells after ionizing-irradiation at doses up to, and exceeding 20 Gy (L87/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This renders them particularly useful for studying aspects of feeder dependence of hematopoietic cell development in long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines are able to function as feeder cells, supporting the long-term proliferation of CD34+ human cord blood cells as well as the clonogenic growth of the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line BL70 </plain></SENT>
