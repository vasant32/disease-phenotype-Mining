<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentration required for 50% inhibition of protein synthesis (IC50) in Daudi cells was 1.3 X 10(-8) M for IgG-A and 5 X 10(-8) M for Fab-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of both A chain immunotoxins was enhanced twofold by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of A chain immunotoxins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi>, a maximum of 99 and 90% reduction of clonal precursors was obtained with IgG and Fab-A chain immunotoxins respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins containing ricin B chain and IgG or Fab fragments specific for the antibody portion of A chain immunotoxins were used as secondary "piggyback" immunotoxins to treat cells that were pretreated with A chain immunotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both B chain immunotoxins were nontoxic at 1 X 10(-6) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When added to target cells pretreated with specific A chain immunotoxins, the IC50 of the A chain immunotoxins was decreased up to 16-fold in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the results obtained with A chain immunotoxins alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> significantly increased the toxicity of the complete piggyback system, resulting in the killing of 99.999% or five logs of target cells in the clonal assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This decreased the IC50 of A chain immunotoxins up to 116-fold when compared with A chain immunotoxin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This enhanced toxicity was independent of the valency of either immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
