<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated virus-cell interactions in the EBV-positive YTN10 cell line, an NK-like cell line established from a patient with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low level expression of the EBV receptor CD21 molecule was detected by FACS and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis identified a latency II pattern of EBV gene expression, consisting of EBNA-1 transcription from the Qp promoter, in the absence of other EBNA gene expression, and accompanied by LMP-1 and LMP-2A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome was present in episomal form and there was evidence for lytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This latency pattern is typical of EBV gene expression in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and differs from the full spectrum of EBV latent gene expression in most posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and from the restricted EBNA-1 expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
