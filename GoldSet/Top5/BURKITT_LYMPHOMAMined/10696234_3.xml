<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We purified to near homogeneity a previously identified 100 kDa mammalian homologous DNA pairing protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purified 100 kDa protein also catalyzed high levels of cell-free homologous DNA recombination activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This ATP-dependent activity was capable of forming conservative recombinant products between two circular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect any DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, or 5' or 3' exonuclease activity associated with this purified material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified 100 kDa protein bound <z:chebi fb="1" ids="32130">silver nitrate</z:chebi> as well as a monoclonal antibody specific for nucleolin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A recombinant protein comprised of the Escherichia coli maltos-ebinding protein fused to the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of human nucleolin possessed homologous DNA pairing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the 100 kDa homologous DNA pairing protein is nucleolin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observation that nucleolin can carry out homologous DNA strand pairing in vitro raises the prospect that it may function similarly in vivo </plain></SENT>
