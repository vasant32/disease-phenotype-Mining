<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the anatomic and histologic presentation and prognosis of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) among people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (PWA) and determine their contribution to the NHL burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We linked <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries in selected areas of the United States and compared NHL sites and histologies in PWA and non-PWA, after adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 51,033 PWA, we found 2,156 cases of NHL (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of NHL cases occurring post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> were not reported to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL was part of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-defining condition for 3.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PWA; the relative risk of NHL with 3.5 years of another <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> diagnosis was 165-fold compared to non-PWA within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surveillance system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of NHLs, 39% were high grade (vs. 12% among non-PWA), 60% were nodal (vs. 74% among non-PWA) and 15% had brain primaries (vs. 1% among non-PWA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding brain sites, extranodal sites were still 20% more common than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative risk was elevated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histologic types, with the risk ranging from 652-fold for high-grade diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and 261-fold for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> to 113 for intermediate-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> to 14-fold for low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival among PWA with NHL was poor, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade had little impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> areas, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related NHLs constitute a major share of the NHL burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NHL risk is considerably under-estimated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The major differences between PWA and non-PWA were the high frequency of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the increase in high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in PWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the grade of NHL did not influence the prognosis among PWA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increasing risk of NHL in PWA has contributed substantially to the general increase in NHL rates in the United States since 1981 </plain></SENT>
