<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with a model in which Bcl-2 contributes to the immortalization of B cells mediated by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore asked whether the expression of Bcl-2 protein correlates with the induction of three <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotypes</z:mp> induced by or associated with LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bcl-2 in primary B cells infected with the B95-8 strain of EBV varied between 1 and 1.8 times that in uninfected cells when 50% of the cells were infected, expressed LMP, and incorporated 20-fold more [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> than did uninfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that induced proliferation of these primary cells is not sufficient to induce Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We found that BALB/c 3T3 cells and their derivatives transformed by LMP do not express Bcl-2 detectably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The expression of LMP at high levels in lymphoid cells is cytotoxic and correlates with an increased expression of Bcl-2 following stable selection for the introduced LMP gene; 2 days after transfection, control vector- and LMP-transfected populations, however, express equal levels of Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed transient expression of LMP in an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We interpret these observations to indicate that increased expression of Bcl-2 is unlikely to contribute to the ability of EBV to immortalize primary B cells and that both the transformation of rodent cells and the cytotoxicity mediated by LMP are independent of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
