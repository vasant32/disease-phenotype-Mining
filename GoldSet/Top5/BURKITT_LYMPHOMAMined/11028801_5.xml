<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have established that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with lympho-proliferative disorders such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV is also present in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of similar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334254" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoepithelioma</z:e>-like <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) arising in a variety of organs, predominantly in stomach, salivary gland and thymus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As reports of EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1266101" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thymic epithelial tumors</z:e> (TET) have been divergent and as different methods have been used to detect EBV, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of EBV in TET of Danish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Archival material of 157 cases of TET (105 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymomas</z:hpo> and 52 thymic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, including 4 lymphoepithelioma-like thymic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (LELTC)) was analyzed for EBV by applying a sensitive and specific method for detecting latently EBV-infected cells (in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> investigated cases were EBER negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EBV does not seem to be implicated in the pathogenesis of TET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a review of the literature showed that 28% of LELTC were EBER <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As they occurred in young people (mean 18 years), at an age when the patients were susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by EBV, it is suggested that EBV merely acts as an innocent bystander </plain></SENT>
