<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve in vitro immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), two in vivo infected LCLs, and one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (EB2) were examined by non-radioactive in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) with a biotinylated EBV probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent hybridization sites were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes frequently carrying the EBV genome were chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In more than 70 chromosomal bands, a greater number of integration sites than expected was found (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of these bands were involved in the majority of the cell lines (for example, 1p31, 1q43, 2p22, 3q28, 4q13, 5p14, 5q12, and 11p15) whereby band 5p14 was involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LCLs analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Virtually no <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integrations were found on the sex chromosomes (X, Y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the EBV integrations was found in G-band-positive material (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings clearly show that EBV integrates into the human genome in a non-random manner </plain></SENT>
