<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three established Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines (Daudi, Raji and DG-75) and three B-non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) of other types (Pfeiffer, Farage and Toledo) were analyzed with respect to the presence of somatic point mutations in their rearranged immunoglobulin Vkappa genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the Vkappa sequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and two of those of the B-NHL were heavily mutated (up to 11%), when compared with their closest germline variable region counterparts ("clonal mutations") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one of the six cell lines contained an unmutated germline Vkappa sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clonal mutations have features characteristic of the mutation machinery operating in the course of the T-dependent immune response, such as a preference of mutations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26386">purine bases</z:chebi>, more transitions than transversions and targeting to CDR and to known "hotspot" motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence variations among different Vkappa PCR clones isolated from each of the cell lines ("intraclonal mutations") showed that the Vkappa of Toledo exhibited about 5-fold higher mutation frequency (MF) than the background level of Taq polymerase error (approximately 0.12% mut/bp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the MF of Vkappa of two of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines was 3-4-fold higher than the Taq polymerase misincorporation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the mutation frequencies of the Vkappa of DG-75, Farage and Pfeiffer did not significantly exceed the level of Taq polymerase error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our combined results show that 5 out of the 6 B-cell lines studied originated from B-cells that have already somatically mutated in vivo their rearranged Vkappa genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two of the Burkitt's and one of the B-NHL cell lines exhibit intraclonal variation indicating that the process of somatic hypermutation continued following the neoplastic event, either in vivo or in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are in accord with the presumed origin of the majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and some types of the B-NHL, from centrocytes or centroblasts of the germinal centers in which the process of somatic hypermutation is taking place </plain></SENT>
