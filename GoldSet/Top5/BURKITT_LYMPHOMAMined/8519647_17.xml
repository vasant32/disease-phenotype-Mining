<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivity and specificity of BU12-SAPORIN was identical to that of unmodified native BU12 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BU12-SAPORIN was selectively cytotoxic in vitro in a dose-dependent manner for the CD19+ human common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e>) cell line NALM-6 but exhibited no toxicity for the CD19- T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) cell line HSB-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival of severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice with disseminated NALM-6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was significantly prolonged compared with sham-treated control animals by a course of therapy with BU12-SAPORIN but not with the irrelevant anti-CD7 immunotoxin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38989">HB2</z:chebi>-SAPORIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BU12-SAPORIN had no therapeutic effect in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with disseminated CD19- HSB-2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These preclinical studies have clearly demonstrated the selective cytotoxicity of BU12-SAPORIN for CD19+ target cells both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This, taken together with the lack of expression of the CD19 molecule by any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life-sustaining tissue and its ubiquitous and homogeneous expression by the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> and B-NHL cells, provides the rationale for undertaking a phase I trial of systemic therapy with BU12-SAPORIN </plain></SENT>
