<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that MP reduces the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells without significant damage to bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This information is important because we need to improve the existing in vitro purging regimens used to cleanse autologous marrows of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> before transplantation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who have received high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow (NBM) and Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were treated in parallel with various purging regimens, NBM <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated using soft-agar culture, while Daudi cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated using one-week liquid culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A protocol of 2.0 mg/mL of MP for four hours demonstrated optimal selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When treatment was followed by cryopreservation, a 1.7 log purge of Daudi cells was increased to 2.3 logs while preserving 36% of committed NBM precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We repeated these experiments on a simulated contaminated marrow to model closely the mixture of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells found in advanced, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We evaluated this mixed system by flow cytometric immunoanalysis using the two-color CD10/CD20 markers to detect residual, viable Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our initial results were reproducible in this mixed-cell system, further supporting the evidence for effective in vitro purging of bone marrow using MP </plain></SENT>
