<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-10 appears to be tightly regulated, as the levels of constitutive expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells is extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haematopoetic cells, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cells and EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells express high levels of IL-10 constitutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we have cloned and sequenced IL-10 promoter fragments and analysed their activity in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A nested set of DNA fragments from the IL-10 gene 5'-flanking region was placed upstream of the luciferase gene and assayed for their ability to direct luciferase expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have identified elements within the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-10 gene which can activate or suppress the constitutive expression of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The essential promoter of the IL-10 gene, which induces low levels of luciferase expression, was found to require the major start site of transcription (+1), a TATA-box (-77) and up to 150 additional 5' <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive regulatory sequences are located between -1100/-900 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Negative regulatory elements which abolish luciferase activity were identified between -800/-300 </plain></SENT>
