<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paper is aimed to present preliminary results of identification of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements and quantitative assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels in Polish children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results are presented in the context of clinical significance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> study, current methodology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> assessment and standardization process in Western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: DNA isolated from bone marrow / bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained at diagnosis from 26 children (25 B-precursor ALL, 1 T-ALL) aged 1.3-16.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PCR-heteroduplex analysis, based on standard BIOMED-1 and BIOMED-2 primer combinations and protocols for detection of rearrangements and clonality assessment; sequencing of clonal PCR products and comparison with germline sequences of Ig/TCR genes for identification of the rearranged genes andjunctional regions; real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with the use of TaqMan probes for assessment of follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels (in 11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clonal TCRG, incomplete TCRD, Vdelta2-Jalpha, TCRB, IGK-Kde and IGH gene rearrangements were detected in 61, 61, 35, 13, 39 and 83% of patients, respectively, which was generally concordant with published data for patients of other European nations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to broaden the scope of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> study in Poland and to develop Polish standards of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> diagnostics, based on current European experience and standards </plain></SENT>
