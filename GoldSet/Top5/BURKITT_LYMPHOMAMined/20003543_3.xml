<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies from developed countries have shown differences in survival for the different immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such studies are lacking in Africa where diagnosis is largely dependent on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report immunohistochemical and other prognostic factors in B cell non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients in Kampala, Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue blocks from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda, from 1991-2000, were sub typed using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, Giemsa as well as immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using tissue micro array, 119 biopsies were subjected to: CD3, CD5, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD30, CD38, CD79a, CD138, Bcl-6, Bcl-2, IRTA-1, MUM1/IRF4, Bcl-1/cyclin D1, TdT, ALKc, and Ki-67/Mib1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case notes were retrieved for: disease stage, chemotherapy courses received and retrospective follow up was done for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non Hodgkin B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> comprised of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>] (95/119) diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (19/119), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4/119) and precursor B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1/119) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, good prognosis was associated with receiving chemotherapy, female gender and CD30 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only receiving chemotherapy remained significant after Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with activated germinal centre B cell (GCB) pattern (CD10+/-, BCL-6+/-, MUM+/-, CD138+/-) had better survival (98.4 months; 95% CI 89.5 -107.3) than the others (57.3 months; 95% CI 35.5 - 79.0) p = 0.027 (log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activated GCB diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a better prognosis than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, not receiving chemotherapy carried a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Availability of chemotherapy in this resource limited setting is critical for survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
