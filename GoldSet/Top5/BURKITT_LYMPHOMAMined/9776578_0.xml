<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have successfully developed a highly sensitive and specific assay system for human interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulated gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based on a human Jijoye cell line with the germline epsilon transcript promoter joined to the human growth hormone (hGH) cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The germline epsilon transcript promoter is responsive to IL-4 and involved in immunoglobulin heavy chain class switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We cloned hGH complementary DNA (cDNA) as the reporter gene instead of using conventional hGH genomic DNA which failed to generate any IL-4 inducible clone in human Jijoye cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two IL-4 inducible cell lines with the hGH cDNA reporter show high signal/noise ratio for IL-4-mediated induction (60-90 fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to IL-4 is dose-dependent with ED50 of 10 pM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected, there is no response to other human cytokines and growth factors, as well as mouse IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutant hIL-4 antagonist hIL-4.Y124D inhibits the induction mediated by native hIL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These IL-4 inducible cell lines provide a sensitive, specific assay system to study IL-4-regulated gene expression, and in particular the regulation of the germline epsilon promoter </plain></SENT>
