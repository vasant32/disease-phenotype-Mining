<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two components of oriP are a region containing a 65-base-pair (bp) dyad symmetry and a region containing 20 copies of a 30-bp direct repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the 30-bp family of repeats of oriP can function as a transcriptional enhancer that is activated in trans by the EBNA-1 gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In either EBV-genome-positive cells or in cells that express EBNA-1, the 30-bp family of repeats, when positioned in either orientation upstream or downstream, enhances expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expressed from either the simian virus 40 early promoter or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 thymidine kinase promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of transcriptional enhancement varies with the promoter and cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This enhanced CAT expression reflects an increased level of CAT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and does not result from amplification of the plasmids expressing CAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasmids carrying the gene for resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16976">hygromycin B</z:chebi> and the 30-bp family of repeats yielded 10 to 100 times more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16976">hygromycin B</z:chebi>-resistant colonies than the vector lacking the 30-bp family of repeats in both EBV-genome-positive cells and cells that express EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
