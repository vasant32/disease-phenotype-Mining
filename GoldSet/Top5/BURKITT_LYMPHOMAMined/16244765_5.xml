<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper presents an analysis of 24 cases in which recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was used in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the largest case aggregation to date and focuses on preliminary experience in the off-label use of this hemostatic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted from the international, Internet-based registry, www.haemostasis.com, accessed in September 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The search results were manually cross-checked against monthly summary reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physicians providing the cases were contacted individually to approve the use of their cases, supply any information missing from the database, and validate the data already held </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell or T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received rFVIIa at total doses of between 18 and 1040 mug/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> stopped in 11 of 24 (46%) patients, markedly decreased in 8 of 24 (33%) patients, and decreased in 4 of 24 (17%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most patients, the response was achieved within 2.5 hours of administration of rFVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of rFVIIa was generally well tolerated -- 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was considered to be possibly related to rFVIIa administration, but this has yet to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A review of these 24 cases submitted to the www.haemostasis.com database suggests that rFVIIa is beneficial in the management of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This warrants further investigation in rigorously controlled clinical trials </plain></SENT>
