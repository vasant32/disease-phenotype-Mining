<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed from 1982 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively, including 262 in the pre-HAART (HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 117; HIV-DLCL, 145) and 101 in the HAART era (HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 18; HIV-DLCL, 83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-HAART included those who did not receive HAART, and HAART era included those diagnosed after January 1997 who received HAART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, history of injection drug use, prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, and disease stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, HIV-DLCL was associated with significantly lower CD4 counts in the pre-HAART but not the HAART era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the overall median survival was similar for both groups in the pre-HAART era (HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 6.4 months v HIV-DLCL, 8.3 months; P = .43), survival was significantly worse in patients with HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the HAART era (HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 5.7 months v HIV-DLCL, 43.2 months; P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure to attain complete remission and CD4 count less than 100 cells/mm(3) independently predicted for poor survival in the pre-HAART era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison, histology of HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and no attainment of complete remission were independent poor prognostic factors in the HAART era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Survival of patients with HIV-DLCL has improved in the HAART era, along with CD4 count, whereas survival of similarly treated patients with HIV-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> remained poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current practice of using the same regimen for both groups of patients should be re-evaluated </plain></SENT>
