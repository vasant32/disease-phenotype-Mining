<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper we show that the cleavage of fodrin to a 150 kDa fragment is an early proteolytic event in radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the Burkitts' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL30A and requires 100 microM zVAD-fmk for inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caspases-1, -3, -6 and -7 were shown to cleave fodrin to the 150 kDa fragment in vitro and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were inhibited by 10 microM zVAD-fmk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that the in vitro cleavage of fodrin by calpain is inhibited by 100 microM zVAD-fmk as was the calpain-mediated hydrolysis of casein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that calpain is activated within 15 min after radiation exposure, concomitant with the cleavage of fodrin to the 150 kDa fragment whereas caspase-3 is activated at 2 h correlating with the cleavage of fodrin to the 120 kDa fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support a role for calpain in the early phases of the radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway, upstream of the caspases </plain></SENT>
