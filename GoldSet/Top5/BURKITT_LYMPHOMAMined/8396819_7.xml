<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the expression of EBV early proteins were studied in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Akata stimulated with anti-human immunoglobulin G antibody (anti-IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Akata cells contained approximately 20 copies of EBV genome per cell as covalently closed, circular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA replication was observed at 6 hr and reached a maximal level at 24 hr after treatment with anti-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Virion DNA was found in the culture medium at 12 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of expression of BMRF1 gene product (early antigen diffuse component; EA-D) paralleled that of EBV deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and of DNA polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting analysis showed that three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with molecular masses of 54, 52, and 49 kilodaltons (kDa) were recognized as EA-D components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EBV DNase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was detected by immunoblotting at 53 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-EBV DNA polymerase antibody recognized 120- and 54-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> in the Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting showed that EA-D and EBV DNase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-EBV DNase antibody and with anti-EA-D monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that EA-D forms a complex with EBV DNase <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The molecules of EA-D, EBV DNase, and DNA polymerase appear to be closely associated together on the EBV replication </plain></SENT>
