<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complementary DNA expression library was screened with a Myc fusion protein to identify proteins interacting with this domain, and a clone encoding the Rb-related p107 protein was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p107 protein was shown to associate with Myc in vivo and to suppress the activity of the Myc transactivation domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, mutant forms of Myc from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which contain sequence alterations in the transactivation domain, were resistant to p107-mediated suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, disruption of a regulatory interaction between Myc and p107 may be important in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
