<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A homogeneous preparation of a urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> has been isolated from urine of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> and advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> of colon and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This molecule, Mr 30 kDa, is homologous to EDC1, a proteinase inhibitor antigenically related to plasma inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IATI) originally isolated from the urine of a leukemic patient, E.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The newly isolated EDC1 inhibits cellular proliferation of a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji, growing in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17351">linoleic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This concentration-dependent inhibitory effect was monitored in terms of change in cell number and 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth of cells treated with approximately 3.3 pmol EDC1/ml was 50% that of the control group by both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EDC1 was not cytotoxic to the cells because the EDC1-treated cells excluded trypan blue and resumed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth after removal of EDC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, EDC1 treatment of Raji cells prelabeled with 3H-labeled DNA did not release more radioactivity into the conditioned medium than the untreated labeled cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EDC1 did not affect the growth of Hs2B2, a B-lymphoblast cell line, and Hs294T, a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Equimolar and larger quantities of other proteinase inhibitors with inhibitory profiles similar to that of EDC1 (alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and turkey ovomucoid) did not affect the growth of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Raji cells have an absolute requirement of transferrin as a nutrient and require insulin to modulate the expression of transferrin receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cells also synthesize interleukin-1 as an autocrine growth stimulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EDC1 did not form a detectable complex with transferrin, insulin, or any autocrine factor synthesized by the cells </plain></SENT>
