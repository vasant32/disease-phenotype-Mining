<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy on the orbital cavity is the treatment of choice for this unusual presentation of localized non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness and the toxicity of radiation treatment in patients with primary orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients having primary orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated in our department between May 1983 and September 2006 were investigated in a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Either 60Co gamma rays or 6 MV X rays were used to deliver daily fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy, 5 times/week, with total doses ranging from 34.2 to 50 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients had stage IE, three had stage II and one stage IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients had marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local control (LC), disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and late side effects were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow up of 45 months, LC was obtained in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The estimated 5- and 7-year DFS rates were 75.8% and 55.3%, and the 5- and 7-year OS rates were 88.7% and 79.9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> toxicity was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late toxicity such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000491'>keratitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001097'>xerophthalmia</z:hpo> occurred respectively in 12 (25.5%), 5 (10.6%), 1 (2.1%), and 9 (19.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy is an effective and at the same time well tolerated treatment for primary orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
