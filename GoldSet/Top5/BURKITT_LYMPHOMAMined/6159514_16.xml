<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural killer activity of blood-lymphocytes was low, and so was the percentage of T-lymphocytes with Fc receptors for IgG (T-gamma cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal studies revealed a defect in the long arms of one of the chromosomes in pair no. 16 (16q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The defect only appeared after addition of interferon to the lymphocyte cultures and preferentially in T-gamma lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease progressed despite attempts to restore the patient's immune reactivity by interferon, transfer factor, and blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Necropsy showed that the severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of lymph nodes found during life had become a Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible connection between an interferon-induced chromosomal defect (break at 16q22) and reduced level of natural killer activity, reduced T-gamma lymphocytes, and proliferation of EBV-positive B-lymphocytes is discussed </plain></SENT>
