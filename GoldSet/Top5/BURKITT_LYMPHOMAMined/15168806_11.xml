<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: More than 80% of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) occurring in transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load (EBV-VL) is predictive of NHL occurrence in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to determine EBV-VL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD), both according to disease activity and use of immunosuppressive therapy, including infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 1999 and July 2001, EBV-VL was determined 212 times by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 138 patients with CD and in 24 EBV-seropositive controls free of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV-VL did not differ significantly between the controls and the patients with CD and was not influenced by CD activity or by immunosuppressive therapy, including recent infliximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High EBV-VL values were observed in two patients with severe uncontrolled CD, but returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> once the flare-up had been controlled (by immunosuppressive drugs in one case and by surgery in the other case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load is on the whole similar in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and in EBV-seropositive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infliximab infusion does not seem to increase significantly EBV-VL in the short-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> have transient, very high EBV-VL values that are compatible with an increased risk of NHL in the transplant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term clinical outcome of these patients must be determined </plain></SENT>
