<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear proteins play a central role in regulating gene expression, but are often under-represented in proteomic studies due to their lower abundance in comparison to cellular 'housekeeping' metabolic enzymes and structural proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reliable procedure for separation and proteomic analysis of nuclear proteins would be useful for investigations of cell proliferation and differentiation during disease processes (e.g., human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have purified nuclei from the human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line, Raji, using <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The integrity and purity of the nuclei were assessed by light microscopy and proteins from the nuclear fractions were separated by 2-DE and identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 124 unique proteins were identified, of which 91% (n=110) were predicted to be nuclear using PSORT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteins from the nuclear fraction were subjected to affinity chromatography on DNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> to isolate DNA-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From this purified fraction, 131 unique proteins were identified, of which 69% (n=90) were known or predicted DNA-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Purification of nuclei and subsequent enrichment of DNA-binding proteins allowed identification of a total of 209 unique proteins, many involved in transcription and/or correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data obtained should be valuable for identification of biomarkers and targets for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy, and for furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development and progression </plain></SENT>
