<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics, histology, risk factors and prognosis of these patients, in a Chilean public hospital in Chile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records of 55 patients (45 males) aged between 23 and 67 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and HIV positive serology, diagnosed between 1992-2008, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients (11%) had Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) and the rest, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> constituted 83.7% of NHL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 24 cases (43.6%), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 12 cases (21.8%), and plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 5 cases (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty five patients (64%) underwent curative intended chemotherapy (CT) concomitantly with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three year survival of the whole cohort was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the most important prognostic factors for long term survival, were complete responses to CT, (p &lt; 0.01) and a low international prognostic index (IPI) score for NHL, (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HAART, histologic subtype and CD4 lymphocyte count at diagnosis, did not influence survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most important prognostic factors for HIV patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were achieving CR with CT and low IPI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prognosis remains poor, even with HAART therapy </plain></SENT>
