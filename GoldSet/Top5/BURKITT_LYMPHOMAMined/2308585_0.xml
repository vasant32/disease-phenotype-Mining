<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is built on functional morphological basis (immunohistology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New methods have reslited in identification of new types of mls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of high number of cases registered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Reference Centre, specific organic distribution new entities can be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perifollicular B-cellular mls of MALT type are frequent in gastrointestinal tract and are rare in Waldeyer ring and in lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric determination of DNA content of cells proved to be very useful in diagnostics of mls, so the probably determination of aneuploid and proliferative activity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters are of prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recirculation of lymphocytes may play a role in dissemination os nHmls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be studied in immunomorphological (in vitro) test ased on the interaction (adherence) of lymphocytes and of endothelial cells of high endothelial postcapillary venule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations present that B-cellular CLL and clonal cells of plasma cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> show endothelial adherence, while multiple cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> do not </plain></SENT>
