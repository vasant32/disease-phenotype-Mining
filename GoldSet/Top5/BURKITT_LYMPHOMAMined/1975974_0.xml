<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into subgroups based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location and histology and the antibody responses in the various groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in both IgG and IgM antipeptide titres was detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> localized in the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High IgG titres were also noted in Burkitt-type, lymphoblastic, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, low or nil IgG titres were found in unclassified malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e>-centrocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> located in the mediastinum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the occurrence of antipeptide IgM antibody was highest in those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, where IgG titres were low, i.e. in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumours</z:e> and in unclassified malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with the exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> localized in the abdomen and unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, the IgM titres in positive individuals were low and comparable with titres found in a part of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
