<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The possible association of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) with differentiation of B-cells was explored with the use of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic lymphoblastoid cell lines representing sequential stages of B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between patterns of enzyme expression in the cell lines and immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion, chromosome constitution, proliferative rate, cell volume, or the presence of B1 and B2 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-B-cell lines, which were negative for surface Ig or Ig secretion but positive for cytoplasmic mu-chains, showed the presence of 5'-NT, whereas 9 of 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Burkitt's or non-Burkitt's type, both secreting and nonsecreting, did not exhibit enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines and 13 of 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell lines were positive for 5'-NT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that 5'-NT was present in pre-B-cells and in some very early B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5'-NT usually disappeared from early and some intermediate B-cells and reappeared in mature B-cells and plasmacytoid cells </plain></SENT>
