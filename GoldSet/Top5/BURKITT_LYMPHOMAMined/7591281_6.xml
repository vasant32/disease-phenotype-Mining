<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed with the aim of better defining the possible role of Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV)-infected cells in the pathogenesis of HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (LAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, since LAS has been considered as a pre-lymphomatous lesion, we also wished to elucidate the possible contribution of EBV-carrying cells present in LAS tissues to the development of HIV-associated malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, we have characterized EBV-infected cells in LAS lymph nodes in terms of EBV DNA prevalence, tissue distribution in relation to HIV-carrying cells, virus sub-type, expression of latent and replicative antigens, and presence of clonal EBV episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with HIV-unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> (4/10, 40%), LAS showed a higher prevalence of EBV DNA (14/20, 70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparable values of EBV prevalence were detected in LAS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> (12/16, 75%) and with follicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> (4/4, 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> EBV+ non-neoplastic lymph nodes from HIV-seronegative patients carried type-I EBV, whereas LAS specimens showed almost equivalent distribution of the 2 EBV sub-types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 EBV-carrying LAS, 4 (29%) were positive by Southern-blot analysis for the BamHI-W region of the virus genome but negative for the presence of monoclonal EBV episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization revealed a remarkably higher load of EBV-infected cells in LAS than in HIV-unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In LAS lymph nodes, EBV-carrying cells were identified as isolated, cytologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> elements, sometimes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, usually scattered throughout the interfollicular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the expression of HIV p24 was restricted to germinal center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the EBV+ LAS samples were negative for the expression of EBV-encoded latent (LMP-1 and EBNA-2) and replicative proteins (BZLF-1, BHLF-1, EA-D, EA-R and VCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes using 2 different polymerase-chain-reaction protocols showed evidence of B-cell clonal expansion in 2/20 (10%) LAS, one EBV- case, and one sample with low numbers of EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that (i) EBV-carrying cells are probably not involved in the development of LAS, either directly or indirectly; (ii) type-2-EBV-infected cells are present in LAS lymph nodes from the early phases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>; (iii) EBV-carrying LAS per se probably does not constitute a lesion at high risk for subsequent development of EBV+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; (iv) it is unlikely that a high <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load or strong EBV-mediated antigenic stimulation plays a contributory role in the development of EBV-unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of HIV-seropositive individuals </plain></SENT>
