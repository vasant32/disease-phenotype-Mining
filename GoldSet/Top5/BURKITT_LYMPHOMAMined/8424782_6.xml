<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ionomycin-induced Mg(2+)-mobilization response is dependent on the influx of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation, induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> or anti-receptor antibodies, a Mg(2+)-mobilization response does occur in a small fraction of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous measurement of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i and [Mg2+]i in individual cells showed that the receptor-triggered Mg(2+)-mobilization response is restricted to cells that have a high [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can therefore be concluded that a high [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i induces the release into the cytoplasm of Mg2+ from intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
