<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The data that the p16INK4A gene is frequently inactivated in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and that this event often accompanies the inactivation of p14ARF in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> prompted us to examine the genetic and methylation status of both genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The existence of gene deletion, mutation and promoter methylation was investigated by single-strand conformational polymorphism, direct sequencing and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sequencing of each exon of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor genes revealed p16INK4A mutation only in 3 out of 11 BL, but 1 of them also affected the p14ARF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSP analysis of promoters showed p16INK4A to be methylated and p14ARF not to be methylated in each Epstein-Barr virus-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary B-cells and de novo established LCLs had no genetic changes or methylated promoter of either gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LCLs achieving the stage of immortalization usually showed methylation of both p16INK4A and p14ARF promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in contrast to p161NK4A, inactivation of p14ARF by either genetic change or promoter methylation has no importance in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, while its methylation has a central role in the immortalization of LCLs </plain></SENT>
