<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protection requires expression of the latency-associated nuclear proteins EBNA3A and EBNA3C and correlates with their ability to cooperate in the repression of the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only protein BIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we confirm that latent EBV in B cells also inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by two other agents--ionomycin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>--and show that these act by a distinct pathway that involves a p53-independent increase in expression of another pro-apoptotic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses employing a variety of B cells infected with naturally occurring EBV or B95.8 EBV-BAC recombinant mutants indicated that the block to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> induction does not depend on the well-characterized <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency-associated genes (EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, the LMPs or the EBERs) or expression of BIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> was shown to be at least partly at the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the requirement for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> to induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this context was demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi>-specific shRNA-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although recombinant EBV with a deletion removing the BHRF1 locus--that encodes the BCL2-homologue BHRF1 and three microRNAs--partially abrogates protection against ionomycin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>, the deletion has no effect on the EBV-mediated block to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50397">NOXA</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
