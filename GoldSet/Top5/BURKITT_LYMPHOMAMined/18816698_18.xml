<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To estimate the response rate and therapy related toxicities of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab when combined with chemotherapy including ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (ICE) in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received rituximab and ICE for 1-3 cycles, depending upon response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was given on day 1 and 3 of each cycle (day 1 only for cycle 3), with ifosfamide (3,000 mg/m(2)) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (100 mg/m(2)) given on days 3, 4, and 5 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> (635 mg/m(2)) given on day 3 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 were eligible and evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although hematologic toxicities were common, only one patient was removed from study due to prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicities related to infusions of rituximab were frequent but manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the six eligible patients with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three achieved complete remission (CR), one had stable disease (SD), and two had progressive disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 eligible patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, there were four complete responses (CR), five partial responses (PR), one SD, and four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CR/PR rate for the entire group was 12/20 (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following completion of protocol therapy six patients were able to proceed to consolidation with high-dose therapy and stem cell rescue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rituximab and ICE chemotherapy was associated with an encouraging objective response (OR) rate and an acceptable toxicity profile </plain></SENT>
