<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> nuclear protein EBNA3C to activate transcription of two EBNA2-responsive genes and to inhibit EBNA2 activation of transcription in transient-transfection assays appears to be due to its ability to interact with RBPJkappa, a cell protein that links EBNA2 to its response elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now show that EBNA3A and EBNA3B expressed in non-EBV-infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> lymphoblasts are similar to EBNA3C in binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase-RBPJkappa in vitro and in coimmunoprecipitating from cell lysates with antibody to RBPJkappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA3A and EBNA3B can also inhibit the interaction of RBPJkappa with cognate DNA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although EBNA3 open reading frames are each close to 1,000 codons long, EBNA3A amino acids 1 to 138, EBNA3B amino acids 1 to 311, and EBNA3C amino acids 1 to 183 are sufficient for RBPJkappa interaction, while EBNA3B amino acids I to 109 have less or no binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RBPJkappa interacting domains overlap with the most highly conserved domain (amino acids 90 to 320) among the EBNA3 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the EBNA3 gene family appears to have evolved to differentially regulate promoters with RBPJkappa binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA2, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C are important in EBV transformation of primary human B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their interaction with RBPJkappa links EBV transformation to the notch signaling pathway and the effects of activated notch in T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
