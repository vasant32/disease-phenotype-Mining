<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cell-free assay was developed to measure the binding of iodinated human interferon-alpha 2 to membranes prepared from lymphoblastoid Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of binding were similar at 0 degrees C and 30 degrees C, with 1.3-fold more interferon bound at the higher temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Membrane preparations treated with <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 proved to be a convenient source of solubilized receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An assay was developed to measure the binding of 125I-labeled interferon (125I-interferon) to solubilized receptors, based on the precipitation of interferon-receptor complexes with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal binding with this assay was obtained at 0 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The solubilized receptor was analyzed by zonal sedimentation centrifugation and gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sedimentation analysis in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> and 2H2O gradients provided the sedimentation coefficient and the partial specific volume of the receptor-<z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gel filtration chromatography provided the Stokes radius of this complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these data we calculated several physical parameters, including Mr = 95,000 for the protein portion of the complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The receptor is a highly asymmetric and hydrophobic membrane protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>125I-Interferon could be crosslinked to receptors of intact Daudi cells or of isolated membranes by use of disuccinimidyl suberate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The covalently linked 125I-interferon-receptor complexes were analyzed by gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A single band with Mr = 140,000 was detected in gel autoradiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If one molecule of interferon is present in this complex, the Mr of the receptor is close to 120,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for the different Mr values obtained with the two analytical procedures used are discussed </plain></SENT>
