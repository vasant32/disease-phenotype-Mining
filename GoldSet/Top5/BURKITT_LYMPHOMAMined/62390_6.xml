<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty lymphoblast cell lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> have been studied for surface receptors including surface Ig, complement receptors by the EAC rosette and fluorescent (Raji cell) techniques, and Fc (aggregate) receptor by direct and indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the B-cell tropism of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an effort was made to correlate the expresion of various surface properties of lymphoblastoid cell lines with the content of EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA as determined by complementary <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-DNA (cNRA-DNA) hybridization on membrane filters or by DNA-DNA renaturation kinetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only correlation established was with the Fc receptor determined by direct immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation of EBV genome equivalents per cell with complement receptor or surface Ig was noted, suggesting that the expression of these receptors is not influenced by EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subgroups of lymphoblastoid cell lines were on the basis of variable expression of surface receptors, designated B1, B2, B3, B4, and T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of lymphoblastoid cell lines into these subgroups were in the ratio of 14:4:1:4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B1, B2, and B4 cell lines (except Molt 4F) were found to contain EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The B3 subgroup, for wich cell line 698 was the sole example, expressed surface immunoglobulins but no other B-cell characteristics, and H.S.B., a T-cell line, lacked detectable EBV </plain></SENT>
