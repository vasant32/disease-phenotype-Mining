<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human MHC class I proteins are expressed on almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nucleated cells as a heavy chain (about 45 kDa) non-covalently associated with beta 2-microglobulin (12 kDa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that MHC class I (MHC-I) proteins can also be associated with a 90-kDa protein in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface-radiolabelled cells were treated with dithiobis succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> (DSP) in order to preserve multimer protein complexes during cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lysates were immunoprecipitated and analysed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE and autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation of human MHC-I proteins co-precipitated another protein of about 90 kDa in molecular weight-p90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>p90 was coprecipitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the MHC-I expressing cells tested: U937, Raji, Molt-4 and IFN-gamma treated K562, but not from untreated, MHC-I negative K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 90-kDa protein was also co-precipitated with MHC-I from fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p90 was coprecipitated by different MoAbs to the MHC-I heavy chain or beta 2-microglobulin, but not by control antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two additional co-precipitating proteins at 34 kDa and 28 kDa were seen in MHC-I precipitates from Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that MHC-I proteins and the 90-kDa protein are associated in the cell membrane, probably by a close but weak, non-covalent interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two additional cell surface proteins at 34 kDa and 28 kDa seem to be MHC-I associated on Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
