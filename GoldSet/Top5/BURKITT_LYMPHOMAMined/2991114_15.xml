<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal location of these sequences has been determined by screening a panel of human/rodent hybrid cell lines containing overlapping subsets of human chromosomes for the presence of human gamma-crystallin sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By correlating these genomic hybridization data with the chromosomal constitution of the somatic cell hybrids, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human gamma-crystallin sequences could be assigned to chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The use of human/hamster cell hybrids derived from human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carrying a reciprocal translocation between human chromosomes 2 and 8, allowed a further localization of the sequences to the region 2p12-qter </plain></SENT>
