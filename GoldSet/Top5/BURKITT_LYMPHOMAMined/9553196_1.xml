<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 9-year-old boy had a fist-sized, hard, non-movable mass in the lower abdomen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum lactic dehydrogenase level was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At surgery, a solid, hard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> 15 x 10 cm in size was found in the jejunum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intestinal wall was diffusely thickened with an intact mucosa </plain></SENT>
