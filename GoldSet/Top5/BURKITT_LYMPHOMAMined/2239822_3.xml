<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some recent reports indicate a high frequency of immunophenotypic aberrancy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this issue with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e>, the authors reviewed the immunophenotyping data from 39 cases analyzed in their clinical laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was performed with the use of a panel of 21 B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surface antigen profiles of the leukemic cells were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and thymic counterparts, as defined by current models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six cases were B-precursor ALL, 8 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, and 3 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two cases coexpressed lymphoid and myeloid antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intralineage aberrancy was quite common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypes from 13 of 26 B-precursor ALL cases deviated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lineage marrow cells as defined by a recent classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cases were also immunophenotypically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This high incidence of aberrant antigen expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> also involves aberrant differentiation rather than purely a process of maturational arrest </plain></SENT>
