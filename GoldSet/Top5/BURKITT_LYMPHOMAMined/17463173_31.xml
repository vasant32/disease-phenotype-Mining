<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Molecular-level differentiation of neoplastic cells is essential for accurate and early diagnosis, but effective molecular probes for molecular analysis and profiling of neoplastic cells are not yet available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently developed a cell-based SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) strategy to generate aptamers (designer DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> probes) as molecular probes to recognize neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested 6 cell-SELEX-generated aptamers with equilibrium dissociation constants in the nanomolar to subnanomolar range: sgd5, selected from Toledo cells, a human diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (B-cell), and sgc8, sgc3, sgc4, sgd2, and sgd3 from CCRF-CEM cells, a human precursor T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aptamers were labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> fluorophores and then used to recognize, by flow cytometric analysis, neoplastic cells in cultured hematopoietic cell lines and clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aptamer sgd5 recognized only its target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aptamers sgc3, sgd2, sgd3, sgc4, and sgc8, selected from a T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line, identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cultured T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines with relatively high fluorescence intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aptamers sgc8, sgc3, and sgd3 showed good selectivity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cells and almost no binding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selected aptamers also detected targets on the cell membranes of neoplastic cells in patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aptamers selected against cultured neoplastic cells can effectively be used as molecular probes for recognition of neoplastic cells in patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell-based aptamer selection can be used to generate aptamer probes to obtain molecular signatures of neoplastic cells in patient samples </plain></SENT>
