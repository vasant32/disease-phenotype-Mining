<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were performed on 25 samples obtained from 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these were also simultaneously studied with nucleic acid flow cytometry to determine percent S-phase and DNA content (ploidy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 17 cases (68%), evaluable metaphases were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluable metaphase rate was higher in previously untreated patients (15/19 or 79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two cases showed abnormal karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five cases showing either the t(8;14) or t(8;22) abnormality were associated with extremely high percent S-phase values, ranging from 36% to 47%, which is in the range of high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to our previous experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of these cases were diagnosed as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and one as diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further review of this latter case resulted in the pathologic diagnosis being changed to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had either numerical or structural abnormalities of chromosome #21 [two cases of extra chromosomes and one i(21q)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three cases were diagnosed as diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four instances of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one of these was diagnosed as diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining three were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in two and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two instances of t(14;18) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is the characteristic abnormality of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One of these cases was a follicular large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The second case had possibly originated from a follicular mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and had evolved into a diffuse mixed cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both of these cases had low S-phase values in the range of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The correlation between ploidy as determined by flow cytometry and cytogenetic analysis was good whenever the DNA index was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, when the DNA index was 1.0 (diploid), concordant measurements were observed in only five of eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry detected one instance of clearly abnormal ploidy, which was thought to be diploid by cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This case most likely represents a "false negative" cytogenetic determination </plain></SENT>
