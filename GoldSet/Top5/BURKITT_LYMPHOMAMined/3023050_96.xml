<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the EB virus recovered from these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines was used to transform peripheral blood lymphocytes from seronegative donors, the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that arose were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LYDMA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the LYDMA-negative nature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> is not the result of a mutation in the resident <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome but is rather a specific adaptation in those cells, perhaps permitting evasion of the host immune surveillance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the EBV gene expression in six LYDMA-negative and two LYDMA-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and in their corresponding LCLs revealed that several of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines did not express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene products classically associated with latent transformation by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four out of eight cell lines showed restricted expression of the latent membrane protein (LMP) and/or the EB nuclear antigen, EBNA 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new level of EBV gene regulation therefore appears to be operating in some of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patterns of expression of EBV genes in the cell lines did not show any correlation with the known susceptibility of the lines to T cell killing </plain></SENT>
