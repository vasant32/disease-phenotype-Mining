<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is both an increased incidence of NHL and a poorer prognosis for the disease in these HIV-infected persons, compared with patients who spontaneously develop NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A series of 41 consecutive patients with HIV-associated NHL treated at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, between 1984 and September 1989 was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 36 had NHL proven on biopsy and NHL was diagnosed clinically in the other five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On histologic examination 11 had high-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, small non-cleaved cell (SNCC) type, similar to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 18 had high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (LCI) type, and seven could not be classified due to inadequate material for assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of these two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those patients with LCI had advanced CD4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and poor survival (median = 6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other group with SNCC had better preserved immune function, and longer survival (median = 18 weeks) </plain></SENT>
