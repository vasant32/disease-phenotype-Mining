<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 55 cases of T-lineage ALL, compared with 159 of 191 B-lineage cases, expressed the CD45 antigen (P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CD45 expression did not differ between cases of early pre-B (CD19+, cytoplasmic mu-) and pre-B (CD19+, cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases of ALL lacking CD45 had significantly lower leukocyte counts (P = .002) and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P = .007) and were more likely to have leukemic cell hyperdiploidy greater than 50 (P less than .0001) or a DNA index greater than 1.15 (P less than .0001), as compared with cases positive for the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 130 patients whose follow-up duration was sufficient for analysis of event-free survival, the 53 with the highest levels of CD45 expression (greater than or equal to 90%) were the most likely to have an adverse event on intensive multiagent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without detectable CD45 had a negligible risk of failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests a relationship between the expression of the CD45 antigen on leukemic lymphoblasts and other biologic factors that influence prognosis in ALL </plain></SENT>
