<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously described a monoclonal antibody, referred to as 38.13, reacting with most Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) derived lines, both with and without Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but not reacting with EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (Wiels et al., 1981, 1982) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody reacted with 41 BL lines out of 57 tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The target antigen, BLA, was shown to be a neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi>, identified as globotriaosylceramide (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1----4Gal beta 1----4 Glc beta 1----1 ceramide) (Nudelman et al., 1983) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This substance is known as the blood group antigen Pk, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intermediate in the P-substance synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 38.13 antibody was covalently linked to either ricin-A chain or gelonin toxin, and its anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> specificity remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both immunotoxins were highly cytotoxic for cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the toxic effects of the immunotoxins on these cells appeared to be strikingly fast, since 50% protein synthesis inhibition was achieved after two hours' incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These kinetics are similar to those obtained with entire ricin, and clearly different from those observed when using immunotoxins directed against protein antigens (16-30 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When longer incubation times are used, killing of apparently irrelevant targets was reproducibly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the presence of a low number of antigenic sites on non-Burkitt cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detection of a low number of antigenic sites by immunotoxins directed towards such <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigens might not be a disadvantage, but might rather permit efficient and rapid killing of a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
