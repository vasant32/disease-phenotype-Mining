<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BJAB, derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of an exceptional African case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, has previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike 97% of African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases studied, neither the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells nor the cell line contained detectable amounts of EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) DNA, nor did they express the EBV-determined nuclear antigen EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells of the established line had the characteristics of B-type lymphocytes and they carried receptors for EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBNA was induced in the majority of BJAB cells after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Usually the cells died within 10 days of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, but it was possible to establish a permanent EBNA-positive variant (GC-BJAB) of BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient from whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> the original BJAB line was established was seropositive for EBV antigens, indicating previous exposure to and continuing presence of the virus; yet the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> had not become infected by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This evidence shows that EBV is not readily "picked up" by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
