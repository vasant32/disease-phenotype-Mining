<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a 65-year-old woman with follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), grade 1, stage IV, which occurred concurrently with B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through the evaluation of FL, the cells that were morphologically suspected of having undergone transformation were found in the bone marrow, and flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses detected the transformed population that suggested concomitant t(8;22) with typical t(14;18) FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeated analyses of the lymph nodes demonstrated the typical morphological, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features of FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient received several multiagent chemotherapy regimens, but the disease gradually became resistant, and the patient died of leukemic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, cases involving both BCL2 and MYC translocations simultaneously, so-called "double-hit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DHL)", have occasionally been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with this type of translocation have a very poor clinical outcome, and no standard therapy has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our case, FL was supposed to have transformed into B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> via Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case is unique in that the transformed DHL cells, derived from clonally related FL cells, showed ongoing transformation from Burkitt-like feature to B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> exclusively in the bone marrow, which suggests that the bone marrow may provide a preferable milieu for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar cases should be accumulated and analyzed carefully </plain></SENT>
