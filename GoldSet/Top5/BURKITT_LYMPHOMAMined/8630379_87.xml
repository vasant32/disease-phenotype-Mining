<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> resistant to conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, no cure existed for patients who relapsed post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our long-term observations on remission induction, after relapse post-BMT, by allogeneic cell therapy (allo-CT) and the feasibility of remission induction in allo-CT-resistant patients by activation of antileukemia effector cells with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The longest observation of successful allo-CT (event-free survival, greater than 8 years) was made in a patient with resistant pre-B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> who received infusions with graded increments of donor (female) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as soon as bulky hematologic and extramedullary relapse was noticed early post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient is currently without evidence of residual host (male) cells as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> in relapse after BMT, 10 were reinduced into complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients with cytogenetic relapse responded to allo-CT alone, while five of six patients with overt hematologic relapse responded only after additional activation of donor with rhIL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allo-CT can, therefore, successfully reverse chemoradiotherapy-resistant relapse of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in patients resistant to donor lymphocyte infusion, remission can be accomplished by additionally activating donor PBL in vitro and/or in vivo with rhIL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our observations, after BMT, allo-CT should be considered the treatment of choice for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> resistant to conventional anticancer modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic activated cell therapy (allo ACT) should be considered for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells resistant to allo-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although allo-CT, followed if indicated by allo-ACT, can be effective for patients with overt hematologic relapse, reversal of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> or documented molecular/cytogenetic relapse early after BMT may also be considered as a possible indication for allo-CT </plain></SENT>
