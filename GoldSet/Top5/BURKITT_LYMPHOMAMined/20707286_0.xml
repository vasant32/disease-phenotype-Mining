<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antitumor drug resistance and side effects of antitumor compounds are the most common problems in medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, finding new antitumor agents with low side effects could be interesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assay antitumor activity of the extract from brown alga Sargassum oligocystum, gathered from Persian Gulf seashore, against K562 and Daudi human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was performed as an in vitro study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the alga extract on proliferation of cell lines were measured by two methods: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and trypan blue exclusion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The most effective antitumor activity has been shown at concentrations 500 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml of the alga extract against Daudi and K562 cell lines, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the extracts of brown alga Sargassum oligocystum have remarkable antitumor activity against K562 and Daudi cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is justified to be suggested for further research such as algal extract fractionation and purification and in vivo studies in order to formulate natural compounds with antitumor activities </plain></SENT>
