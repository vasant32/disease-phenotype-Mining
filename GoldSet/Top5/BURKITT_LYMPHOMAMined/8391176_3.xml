<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method was developed for nonisotopic postembedding in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) on ultrathin sections of frozen and of LR White resin-embedded material at the electron microscopic level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method was successfully applied to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the P3HR1 human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each of the steps in the procedure had to be optimized for successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> on the frozen and LR White sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most important conditions are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predigestion with proteinase K was only necessary with the resin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sections were treated with <z:chebi fb="25" ids="32145">sodium hydroxide</z:chebi> to denature target DNA and were hybridized with a biotinylated probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probe was best detected with a primary antibody to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> followed by a gold-conjugated secondary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm in 10% to 20% of P3HR1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar percentage of cells in thin L-sectioned material prepared by routine methods showed virus particles at different stages of maturation </plain></SENT>
