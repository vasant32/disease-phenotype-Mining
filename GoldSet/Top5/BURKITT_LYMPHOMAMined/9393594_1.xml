<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For B-lineage ALL, these assays usually involve PCR of clonal somatic gene rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most accurate quantification can be achieved by competitive PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present a novel approach for the production of reference standards for use in nested competitive PCR of these gene rearrangements, which might enable more reliable assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> for prognosis and selection of patients for individualised therapy </plain></SENT>
