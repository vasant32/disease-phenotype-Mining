<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incubation of cells of BL2 and of UD61 with various concentrations of IL-4 resulted in induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression in a dose dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was already observed after 16 h of incubation whereas maximal expression was obtained after 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression seemed to be specific for IL-4, because IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and a low m.w </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B cell growth factor were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LFA-1 and LFA-3 induction by IL-4 was blocked specifically by an anti-IL-4 antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of LFA-1 expression by IL-4 was furthermore confirmed at the specific LFA-1 beta-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-4 was unable to induce LFA-1 expression on EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of two LFA-1-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BL2 grows as single cells, but induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression by IL-4 was insufficient to induce homotypic cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and required <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> as a second signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> alone did not induce LFA-1 antigen expression and was unable to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> between BL2 cells in the absence of IL-4 in 22 h assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> to BL2 cells that expressed LFA-1 Ag upon incubation with IL-4 resulted in aggregate formation within 30 min </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, these mAbs dispersed preformed aggregates of BL2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that IL-4 can induce the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 on B cell lines, but that an additional activation signal provided by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> was required for the induction of homotypic cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
