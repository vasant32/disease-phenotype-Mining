<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early after fusion these hybrids carry EBV genomes of the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line integrated near the breakpoint of a translocation chromosome der(19) t(11;19) as well as episomal <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA molecules of the parental LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During long-term culture, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hybrid cell lines lost the integrated EBV sequences and retained exclusively episomal EBV, whereas in parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells the EBV genomes remained stably integrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of integrated EBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases resulted from a break proximal to the EBV integration site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that this integration site had become a gap-like chromatin area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that the integration of the EBV genomes constitutes a chromosomal region prone to break events akin to the phenomenon of fragile sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This instability might have led directly to the loss of the EBV DNA itself and of the chromosome 11 region distal to it </plain></SENT>
