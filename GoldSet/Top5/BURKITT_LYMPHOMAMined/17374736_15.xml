<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for stable-linker <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> to be effective, they must be internalized and degraded, limiting potential targets to surface antigens that are trafficked to lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD79a and CD79b comprise the hetrodimeric signaling component of the B-cell receptor, and are attractive targets for the use of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> because they are B-cell-specific, expressed in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), and are trafficked to a lysosomal-like compartment as part of antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that the stable-linker <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> anti-CD79b-MCC-DM1 and anti-CD79b-MC-MMAF are capable of target-dependent killing of nonHodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, these 2 ADCs are equally effective as low doses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> of follicular, mantle cell, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, even though several of these cell lines express relatively low levels of CD79b in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that anti-CD79b <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> were more effective than anti-CD79a <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> and that, as hypothesized, anti-CD79b antibodies downregulated surface B-cell receptor and were trafficked to the lysosomal-like major histocompatibility complex class II-positive compartment MIIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-CD79b-MCC-DM1 and anti-CD79b-MC-MMAF are promising therapeutics for the treatment of NHL </plain></SENT>
