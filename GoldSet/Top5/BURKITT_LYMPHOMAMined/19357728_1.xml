<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviews retrospectively cases of lymphoreticular diseases seen at a tertiary institution in Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which biopsies from the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues reported within a period of 16 years were reviewed with respect to age, sex and pathological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed for differences in proportion using Chi square by SPSS version 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine hundred and forty four cases comprising 559 biopsies from lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues, 272 bone marrow biopsies and 113 spleen biopsies were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> were the most common lesions in lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The axillary and cervical nodes accounted for most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> accounted for the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastasis to lymph nodes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common pathological changes in bone marrow were NHL and reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (CLL) had the highest mean age, which was significantly higher than in those with NHL (p=.001, 95% confidence interval -27.91 to -7.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common finding in the spleen was splenic rupture and haemoperitoneum from road traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> should be high on the list of differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in Nigerians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whereas trauma from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTA</z:e> was the major reason for splenectomy in Nigerians, in the elderly splenic biopsy would likely show CLL </plain></SENT>
