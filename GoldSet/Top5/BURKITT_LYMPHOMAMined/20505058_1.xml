<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, existing gene selection methods for microarray classification cannot identify which classes are discriminable by these selected genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose an improved linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method that simultaneously selects important genes and identifies the discriminable classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a pairwise fusion penalty for LDA was used to shrink the differences of the class centroids in pairs for each variable and fuse the centroids of indiscriminable classes altogether </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numerical results in analyzing 2 gene expression profiles demonstrate the proposed approach help improve the interpretation of important genes in microarray classification problems </plain></SENT>
