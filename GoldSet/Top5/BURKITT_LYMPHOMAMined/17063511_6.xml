<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primers of multiplex PCR were designed to amplify specific regions of the EBV EBNA1, CMV IE2, and KSHV LANA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This multiplex PCR assay was found to have detection sensitivities of 1-10 copies of purified <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA cloned into the plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess diagnostic and pre-clinical applications with this method, we utilized KSHV-positive primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PEL) cells, EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, CMV-infected fibroblast cells, and clinically prepared peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) that had been infected with viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that this multiplex PCR assay has high sensitivity and specificity for simultaneous detection of EBV, CMV, and KSHV genomes in a single amplification from a clinical material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this multiplex PCR assay, we investigated the prevalence of EBV, CMV, and KSHV in PBL samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Japanese randomly selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KSHV, EBV, and CMV genomes were detected in samples from 2 (0.2%), 377 (39.5%), and 27 (2.8%) of the 953 blood donors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both EBV and CMV genomes were detected in samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KSHV-positive donors </plain></SENT>
