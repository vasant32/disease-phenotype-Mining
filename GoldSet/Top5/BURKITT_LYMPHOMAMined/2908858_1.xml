<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>) cells showed prominent emperipolesis toward SG cells when they were cocultured, whereas T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>) cells attached firmly to the surface of SG cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autologous peripheral B and T cells behaved, respectively, in the same way as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e> cells while directly interacting with the SG cells were completely inhibited from incorporating [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, although radioactive grains were observed in 16.4%-12.4% of supernatant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e> and 13.8%-13.0% of supernatant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e> cells in each coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the media conditioned by SG cells significantly increased the incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e> cells as much as 190% of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that SG cells undergo tissue-specific cellular interactions with B- and T-lymphoid cell lines but not with a myeloid cell line, and they can modify their growth by two distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SG cells proved to be very useful in studying the effect of the lymphoid microenvironment on the proliferation of lymphocytes in vivo </plain></SENT>
