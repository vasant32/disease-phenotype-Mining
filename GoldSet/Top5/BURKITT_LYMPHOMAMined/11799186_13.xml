<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is uniquely able to up-regulate the expression of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transporters (referred to as TAP-1 and TAP-2) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation is often accompanied by a restoration of antigen-presenting function as measured by the ability of these cells to present endogenously expressed <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen to cytotoxic T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the expression of LMP1 resulted in up-regulation and nuclear translocation of RelB that were coincident with increased expression of MHC class I in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the C-terminal activator regions (CTARs) of LMP1 significantly impaired the abilities of LMP1 to translocate RelB into the nucleus and to up-regulate the expression of antigen-processing genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis with single-point mutations within the CTARs confirmed that the residues critical for NF-kappa B activation directly contribute to antigen-processing function regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This LMP1-mediated effect was blocked following expression of either dominant negative I kappa B alpha S32/36A, an NF-kappa B inhibitor, or antisense RelB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that upregulation of antigen-presenting function in B cells mediated by LMP1 is signaled through the NF-kappa B subunit RelB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data provide a mechanism by which LMP1 modulates immunogenicity of Epstein-Barr virus-infected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells </plain></SENT>
