<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of proteins whose expression or function is deregulated in sBL and play a role in its formation could facilitate development of less toxic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that E2F1 expression is deregulated in sBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now investigated the mechanisms underlying E2F1 deregulation and found that the E2F sites in its promoter fail to repress its transcriptional activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and that the transcriptional repressor E2F4 barely interacts with these sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also have found that E2F4 protein levels, but not those of its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, are reduced in sBL cell lines relative to immortal B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E2F4 protein expression is also decreased in 24 of 26 sBL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from patients compared with control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that enforced E2F4 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells not only diminishes E2F1 levels, but also reduces selectively the tumorigenic properties and proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, while increasing their accumulation in G(2)/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results therefore point to E2F4 as a target for developing novel and less toxic treatments for sBL </plain></SENT>
