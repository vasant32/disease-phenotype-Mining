<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice xenografted with human Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells as a model to compare the antilymphoma effects of unconjugated CD19 (CLB-CD19) and CD20 (BCA-B20) mAbs (IgG2a subclass) alone or in combination with recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) or recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (rmGM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with BCA-B20 or rhIL-2 or rmGM-CSF as a single agent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in highly significant decreases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> rates, but did not increase the number of complete regressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination of CLB-CD19 or BCA-B20 mAbs with rhIL-2 or rmGM-CSF resulted in larger decreases of growth rates than either of the agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete eradication of large Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be achieved when treatment with BCA-B20 mAbs was combined with rhIL-2, but not with the combination of CLB-CD19 mAbs and rhIL-2 nor with the combination of BCA-B20 mAbs and rmGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cured animals kept for 2-3 months after complete regression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were still <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was correlated with the infiltration of lymphocytes as well as macrophages into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to show that unconjugated CD20 mAbs are to be preferred over unconjugated CD19 mAbs, and interleukin 2 over GM-CSF in the combinational treatment of large B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
