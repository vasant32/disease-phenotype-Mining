<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study suggests a requirement for active Akt in ALL cells for optimal stromal cell protection during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ALL cells expressing dominant negative Akt were not efficiently rescued from Ara-C or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by stromal cell co-culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, inhibition of ALL cell PI-3 kinase activity diminished stromal cells support of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ALL cell lines co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells during chemotherapy maintained higher levels of phosphorylated Akt protein and reduced PP2A activity when compared to ALL cells treated in medium alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy-induced PARP and Bcl-2 cleavage was reduced in ALL cells cultured with a stromal cell layer compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells exposed to drug in medium alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, interaction with stromal cells was not able to efficiently block treatment-induced PARP or Bcl-2 cleavage in leukemic cells with blunted Akt activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a pivotal role for Akt in mediating stromal cell regulation of ALL cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
