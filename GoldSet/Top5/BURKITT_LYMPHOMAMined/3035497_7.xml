<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the restriction map of the c-myc gene in 15 BL cell lines carrying the variant t(8;22) translocation in which c-myc is known to remain on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using 3 restriction enzymes cutting outside the c-myc domain (EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII), we found no evidence for a c-myc/Ig lambda rearrangement in 14 BL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last one, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 37, the 3' flanking region was rearranged corresponding to the already identified breakpoint located 400 pb downstream from the c-myc gene (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using 4 restriction enzymes cutting inside the c-myc gene (PvuII, PstI, SacI, HincII) we looked for discrete abnormalities within the gene limits, and we found in 9 BL cell lines several abolished and created sites, compatible with multiple independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are significantly clustered in the 5' non coding region, with a striking prevalence at the end of exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role of mutations in the non-coding first exon region for the deregulation of c-myc expression is discussed </plain></SENT>
