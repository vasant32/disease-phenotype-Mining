<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) were reviewed to 1) investigate the value added by using specific gene rearrangement probes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis, prognosis, and subtyping; and 2) evaluate the prevalence of cytogenetic alterations other than specific translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FISH results from assays performed on cytospin preparations from NHL FNAs over a 6-year period (2003-2009) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotyping, clinical data, and cytomorphologic data were reviewed according to the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybridized probes, the purpose for the assay (subtyping or prognosis), and the cytogenetic abnormalities observed were retrieved from cytology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data was categorized according to specific rearrangements and other chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful results were obtained in 284 (95.3%) of 298 cases from 282 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were found in 216 (76%) cases and 68 (24%) did not show alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among cases submitted for subtyping, 198 showed FISH-positive results, and specific gene rearrangements were found in 122 (61.6%) cases as follows: follicular 82, mantle cell 21, marginal zone 3, "dual hit" 13, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 21 cases, abnormalities were useful for prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific alterations alone or in combination with translocations were found in 98 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FISH performed on cytospin preparations was useful for confirmation of specific subclasses of NHL and may also provide valuable prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities other than specific translocations were frequently found and could provide supportive evidence for a definitive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in FNA </plain></SENT>
