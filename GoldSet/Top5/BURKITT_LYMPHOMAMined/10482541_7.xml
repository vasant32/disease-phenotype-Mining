<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the restricted programs of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and a subpopulation of latently infected B cells in healthy EBV carriers, transcription of the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) gene is mediated by the promoter Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, two noncanonical E2F binding sites were identified within Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of E2F in the regulation of Qp, however, has been controversial and is undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that an E2F factor(s) within Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells binds to a G/C-rich element [GGCG(C/G)] within the previously identified binding sites in Qp and prototypical E2F response elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Qp-driven reporter gene expression could be efficiently repressed through either E2F binding site by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor pRb, a potent transcriptional repressor targeted to promoters during G(0) and the early G(1) phase of the cell cycle via its interaction with E2F; a mutant pRb (pRb(706)) lacking E2F binding capability was unable to repress Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe cell cycle variation in the expression of either EBNA-1 mRNA or protein in exponentially growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, consistent with previous predictions that Qp is constitutively active in these cells and with the extremely long t(1/2) of EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, within G(0)/G(1) in growth-arrested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, EBNA-1 mRNA levels were twofold lower than in S phase, similar to the two- to eightfold differences in cell cycle expression of some cyclin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, although regulation of Qp is coupled to the cell cycle, this clearly has no impact on the level of EBNA-1 expressed in proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude, therefore, that the most important contribution of E2F to the regulation of Qp is to direct the pRb-mediated suppression of EBNA-1 expression within resting B cells, the principal reservoir of latent EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This would provide a means to restrict unneeded and potentially deleterious expression of EBNA-1 in a nonproliferating cell and to coordinate the activation of EBNA-1 expression necessary for EBV genome replication and maintenance upon reentry of the cell cycle in response to proliferative signals </plain></SENT>
