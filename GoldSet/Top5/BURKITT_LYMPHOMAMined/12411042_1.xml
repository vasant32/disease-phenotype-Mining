<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 1995 and August 2001, fifty-one patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (median age 34 years, range 5.5 approximately 52 years) received allo-PBSCT from HLA-identical (50) or 1-antigen mismatched sibling donors with conditioning regimens of TBI + CY or modified BU/CY2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) (15 in CR(1), 7 in CR(2) or greater, 10 in relapse including 2 relapse after allo-BMT and the other one never achieved remission); 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) (CP 5, AP 2, BC 4 and relapse after allo-BMT 1); 7 MDS (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318550" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">RAEB 1</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB-T</z:e> 1, AL secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 5); Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was administered for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time (range) to neutrophil &gt;/= 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet &gt;/= 20 x 10(9)/L was 14 (10 approximately 20) and 11 (7 approximately 45) days post-transplant, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade II approximately IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 20/51 (39%) and grade III approximately IV aGVHD in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was diagnosed in 23 of 44 (52%) evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients died: 8 died of transplant related complications, 6 of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients are alive with a median follow-up of 399 (75 approximately 2 176) days, and among them 34 are in continuous complete remission, the other 3 relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2-year probability of overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse is 64%, 61% and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Allogeneic PBSCT is safe for both donors and recipients, and results in a rapid and stable engraftment without increase in incidence or severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
