<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) such as non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) was mainly performed by morphological examination and gene analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are only a few serum/plasma biomarkers such as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha to diagnose ML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classifications are various, and therefore the cell surface markers using flow cytometry or lymph node biopsy have been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is difficult, however, to distinguish the two diseases, NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e>-associated autoimmunoreactivity (autoantibodies) in patients' plasma, a novel proteomics-based approach using electrophoresis/mass spectrometry was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Solubilized proteins from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Raji) were separated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis, in which the plasma of individual patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> was tested for primary antibodies, followed by visualization with anti-IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two proteins, L-plastin and alpha-enolase, capable of reacting with the antibodies in plasma of patients with NHL, were detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of the detections of an anti L-plastin autoantibody were significantly higher: 0.84 (21/25) in patients with NHL; 0.00 (0/4) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>; 0.38 (5/13) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>; 0.20 (2/10) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>; and 0.13 (1/8) in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those of anti alpha-enolase antibody were not specific to NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We first identified autoantibody against L-plastin in plasma of patients with NHL, suggesting that the autoantibody can be a new diagnostic biomarker for NHL </plain></SENT>
