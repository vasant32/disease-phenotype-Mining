<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mucins are among the best described human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least 73 tumor-reactive anti-mucin antibodies have been described; in addition, we have previously demonstrated the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the mucin produced by breast and <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreatic tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated mucin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> can be explained by altered post-translational modification of mucin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, or whether the generation of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> requires changes in the mucin gene itself, we studied four Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and six Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines transfected with an expression construct containing the mucin complementary DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfected cell lines showed stable maintenance of the mucin gene, which comprises 20 or more tandem repeats of a 60-nucleotide sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfected cells expressed many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated mucin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, suggesting that the changes in mucin synthesis seen in breast and <z:mp ids='MP_0009153'>pancreatic tumors</z:mp> are present in other malignant cell types as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even though each cell line was transfected with the identical mucin construct, each expressed a different subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated mucin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the specificity of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is not due to genetic alterations of the mucin gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubating transfected cells with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-alpha-galactosaminide, an inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation, altered cell surface carbohydrate structures and resulted in increased expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, implicating incomplete glycosylation of mucin in the generation of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that alterations in the posttranslational modification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gene products can result in the expression of novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ability to transfect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines with mucin will provide an unlimited supply of autologous, mucin-bearing cells with which to study these patients' T-cell response to mucin </plain></SENT>
