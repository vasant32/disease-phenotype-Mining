<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to develop an effective immunotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, we investigated the applicability of class II transactivator (CIITA), which had been demonstrated to regulate the expression of MHC class II (MHC-II) by assembling the transcription factors of MHC-II molecules, for immunotherapy by potentiating the antigenicity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells by inducing MHC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, 32 hematopoietic cell lines were analysed for the expression of HLA-DR, CIITA, RFX5 or HLA-ABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cell lines were positive and 18 were negative for HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 14 HLA-DR positive cell lines were demonstrated to express CIITA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 18 HLA-DR negative cell lines, the expression of CIITA was not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RFX5, which is one of the transcription factors of MHC-II, was expressed ubiquitously in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cell lines out of 23 hematopoietic cell lines examined were negative for HLA-ABC, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of these cell lines were negative for both HLA-DR and CIITA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CIITA cDNA was transfected into K562 cells, which were negative for HLA-ABC, -DR and -DQ, but positive for HLA-DP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transfection rendered HLA-DR negative to positive and increased the expression level of HLA-DP, but HLA-DQ remained negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to HLA-DR, HLA-ABC was also induced to express by the transfection of CIITA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that the expression of HLA-DR in hematopoietic cells is regulated in subordination to CIITA and the expression of HLA-DR (and HLA-ABC in K562) is induced by transfection with the CIITA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings revealed the applicability of CIITA in potentiating anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour immunity</z:e> of HLA-DR negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells for immunotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
