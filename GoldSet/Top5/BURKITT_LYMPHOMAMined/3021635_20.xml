<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed EBNA-2, only 10 of the 27 BL lines were EBNA-2-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the EBNA-2 coding BamHI W-, Y- and H-fragments of EBV-DNA in the different cell lines by restriction enzyme analysis suggests that EBNA-2 negativity is due either to sequence diversity or to a deletion in the BamHI WYH region </plain></SENT>
