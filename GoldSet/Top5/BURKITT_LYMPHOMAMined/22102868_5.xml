<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MYC is a key transcription factor involved in central cellular processes such as regulation of the cell cycle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation and ribosomal biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is overexpressed in the majority of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is a highlight example for MYC overexpression due to a chromosomal translocation involving the c-MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no genome-wide analysis of MYC-binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been conducted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: ChIP-Seq was performed on 5 BL cell lines with a MYC-specific antibody giving rise to 7,054 MYC-binding sites after bioinformatics analysis of a total of approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>19 million sequence reads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In line with previous findings, binding sites accumulate in gene sets known to be involved in the cell cycle, ribosomal biogenesis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetyltransferase and methyltransferase complexes demonstrating a regulatory role of MYC in these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, MYC-binding sites also accumulate in many B-cell relevant genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional consequences of MYC binding, the ChIP-Seq data were supplemented with siRNA- mediated knock-downs of MYC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines followed by gene expression profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, amongst others, genes involved in the B-cell function were up-regulated in response to MYC silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The 7,054 MYC-binding sites identified by our ChIP-Seq approach greatly extend the knowledge regarding MYC binding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and shed further light on the enormous complexity of the MYC regulatory network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Especially our observations that (i) many B-cell relevant genes are targeted by MYC and (ii) that MYC down-regulation leads to an up-regulation of B-cell genes highlight an interesting aspect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biology </plain></SENT>
