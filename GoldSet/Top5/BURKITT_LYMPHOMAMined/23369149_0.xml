<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), the cytogenetic hallmark of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is also found, but rarely, in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such translocation typically results in a MYC-IGH@ fusion subsequently deregulating and overexpressing MYC on der 14q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In CLL, atypical rearrangements resulting in its gain or loss, within or outside of IGH@ or MYC locus, have been reported, but their clinical significance remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a 67 year-old male with complex cytogenetic findings of apparently balanced t(8;14) and unreported complex rearrangements of IGH@ and MYC loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features were consistent with the diagnosis of CLL.Interphase FISH studies revealed deletions of 11q22.3 and 13q14.3, and an extra copy of IGH@, indicative of rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis showed an apparently balanced t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequential GPG-metaphase FISH studies revealed abnormal signal patterns: rearrangement of IGH break apart probe with the 5'-IGH@ on derivative 8q24.1 and the 3'-IGH@ retained on der 14q; absence of MYC break apart-specific signal on der 8q; and, the presence of unsplit 5'-MYC-3' break apart probe signals on der 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint on 8q24.1 was found to be at least 400 Kb upstream of 5' of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, FISH studies revealed two abnormal clones; one with 13q14.3 deletion, and the other, with concurrent 11q deletion and atypical rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) detected a 7.1 Mb deletion on 11q22.3-q23.3 including ATM, a finding consistent with FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While no significant copy number gain or loss observed on chromosomes 8, 12 and 13, a 455 Kb microdeletion of uncertain clinical significance was detected on 14q32.33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed co-expression of CD19, CD5, and CD23, positive ZAP-70 expression and absence of MYC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall findings reveal an apparently balanced t(8;14) and atypical complex rearrangements involving 3'-IGH@ and a breakpoint at least 400 Kb upstream of MYC, resulting in the relocation of the intact 5'-MYC-3' from der 8q, and apposition to 3'-IGH@ at der 14q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This case report provides unique and additional cytogenetic data that may be of clinical significance in such a rare finding in CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It also highlights the utility of conventional and sequential metaphase FISH in understanding complex chromosome anomalies and their association with other clinical findings in patients with CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLL reported case with such an atypical rearrangement in a patient with a negative MYC expression </plain></SENT>
