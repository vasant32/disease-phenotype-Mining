<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This differentiation, quantified by the appearance of surface antigens characteristic of mature plasma cells, is impaired by addition to the culture medium of the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT; EC 2.4.2.30) inhibitors 3-methoxybenzamide or 3-aminobenzamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These agents also protect the cells against the inhibition of proliferation induced by low doses of interferon alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the large inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation into DNA caused by interferon treatment is not affected by the ADPRT inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">tetradecanoate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> induces the same plasma cell surface antigens that are induced by interferon treatment, and this effect is also impaired by the ADPRT inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that interferons and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> share a mechanism of action that requires ADPRT activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protection of the cells against the antiproliferative effect of interferons by the ADPRT inhibitors suggests that growth inhibition may be a consequence of cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation alone is not sufficient for the cessation of cell proliferation and is not a true reflection of the rate of DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
