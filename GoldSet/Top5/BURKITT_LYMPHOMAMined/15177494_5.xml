<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 175 patients, 21 (12%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity: 9002 protocol (n=11/112) and 9003 (n=10/63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 20 boys and the median age was 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with neurological symptoms due to other causes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> neurological symptoms developed following induction chemotherapy in 7 patients, or after a more intensive course of chemotherapy containing high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients required their chemotherapy to be altered because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died of cerebral haemorrhage but none of the remaining six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurotoxicity is common in children treated with the 9002/9003 protocols and tends to be transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy including high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> is probably the most common predisposing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modification of subsequent chemotherapy is not invariably necessary </plain></SENT>
