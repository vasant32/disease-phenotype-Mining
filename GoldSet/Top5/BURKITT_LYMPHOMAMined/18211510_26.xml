<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of this high-load state is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We speculated that this state may identify patients at high risk for development of late PTLD/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed data on 71 pediatric heart recipients who had serial <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load monitoring since 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> high-load state was defined as the presence of &gt;16,000 genome copies/mL whole blood on &gt; or =50% of samples over at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 20 high-load carriers (eight following prior PTLD, seven with prior symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, five without previous EBV disease), 9 (45%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> PTLD 2.5-8.4 years posttransplant (including with four Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 51 controls with low (n = 39) or absent (n = 12) loads, only 2 (4%; p &lt; 0.001 absent/low vs. high load) developed late PTLD/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariable analysis, high-load carrier state (OR = 12.4, 95% CI 2.1-74.4) and prior history of PTLD (OR = 10.7, 95% CI 1.9-60.6) independently predicted late PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> high EBV-load state is not benign and is a predictor of de novo or recurrent PTLD </plain></SENT>
