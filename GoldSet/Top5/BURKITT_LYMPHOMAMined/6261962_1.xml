<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both antisera showed a high degree of specificity for nuclear proteins of their respective cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This specificity was evident in the reactivity of both whole chromatin and dehistonized chromatin using a quantitative micro-complement fixation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results presented here suggest that DNA present in the antigen is necessary for maintaining the structure of the antigenic site </plain></SENT>
