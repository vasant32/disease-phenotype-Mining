<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After incubation at 37 C for 2 or more days, Basal Medium Eagle (BME) supplemented with 25% fetal calf serum (FCS) was not able to support adequate growth of EB3 and other lines of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medium did, however, increase, by a factor of about 10, the number of cells synthesizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-type virus with which the cultures were persistently infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not every lot of FCS produced these effects, nor were these effects seen when BME and FCS were incubated separately for 7 days before the medium was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 37 C, appropriate lots of FCS interacted with several of the amino acids present in BME; this interaction resulted in an inhibition of cellular growth, whereas interaction with arginine yielded the virus-enhancing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arginine-free BME, supplemented with 25% FCS and used without prior incubation, prevented cellular replication and promoted <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> to a similar extent as did preincubated complete medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Replenishment of arginine reduced, but did not regularly abolish, the virus-enhancing activity of preincubated media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RPMI-1629 medium was less affected by preincubation with FCS because it contained twice the amount of arginine that BME contained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FCS factors which act upon arginine and other amino acids are not dialyzable and are partially resistant to heating at 56 or 60 C for 30 to 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calf and horse sera appear to be devoid of these activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nature of these interactions, as well as the mechanism by which arginine deficiency enhanced the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, remains to be ascertained </plain></SENT>
