<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immature B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is divided into two subtypes, 'pre-B' and 'early pre-B' ALL, by the presence or absence of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (cIg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study their clonal origin, we compared mu-chain transcripts in six cIg+ and eight cIg- ALL samples (CD10+/- CD19+ surface Ig-) with those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> phenotypic counterparts (CD10+ CD19+ surface Ig-) sorted from the bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis showed that the cIg+ ALL samples expressed greater amounts of mu-chain transcripts than the cIg- ALL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ALL samples and their counterparts, sequence analysis of mu-chain transcripts revealed infrequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> of the V(H) genes and the similar usage of D and J(H) gene segments, but the length of complementarity determining region (CDR)-3 in the ALL samples was longer than that in the counterparts (50.0 +/- 15.5 vs 40.8 +/- 12.7 bp, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mu-chain transcripts in the six cIg+ ALL samples and the counterparts (119/120 clones) had productive sequences, whereas those in the eight cIg- ALL samples had nonsense codons and/or frame shifts in their CDR-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a phenotype of ALL, 'pre-B' or 'early pre-B', is associated with V(H)-D-J(H) gene recombinatorial events, and that the CD10+ CD19+ surface Ig- population in the BM is not simply the cellular origin of ALL </plain></SENT>
