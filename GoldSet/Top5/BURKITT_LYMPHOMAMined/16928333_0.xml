<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the complexity of the pathogenesis and pathology of BMN and understand the multiplicity of clinical features, a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome positive</z:e> (Ph+) B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) expressing myeloid antigens was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the clinical features of this case were complicated and multiplex, the diagnosis was confirmed by using bone marrow smear and biopsy, immunophenotype analysis, conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the prognosis of patients improved by active treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Ph+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> expressing myeloid antigen with BMN is very rare, its diagnosis should be confirmed by using multiple methods, and the active treatments should be performed </plain></SENT>
