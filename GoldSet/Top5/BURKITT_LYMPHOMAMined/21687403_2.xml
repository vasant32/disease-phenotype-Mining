<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many viruses infect the immune cells for the propagation of new progenies, thus the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may modulate the host immune homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been more than 45 years since the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of EBV to transform primary B cells in vitro leads to the suggestion for its oncogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, except the clear understanding of the role of EBV in post-transplantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, it remains ambiguous why such a ubiquitous virus causes malignant diseases only in a very small subset of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible explanation is that EBV may cooperate with other environmental and host genetic factors and lead to the development of EBV associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to infecting B cells, recent studies revealed that EBV may impact host immune system more broadly than previously thought, for example the development of regulatory NKT subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead of an intensive review, this article aims to provide a linkage to recent advances on the interplay between EBV and host immune system and to inspire further studies on EBV related diseases, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
