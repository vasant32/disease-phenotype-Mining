<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> zinc finger (PLZF) gene encodes a transcription factor expressed in myeloid, lymphoid and CD34(+) progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Structurally related to BCL-6, which is involved in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, PLZF may have a role in proliferation, differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells, that could be mediated by transcriptional repression of the cyclin A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the levels of expression of PLZF and cyclin A in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocyte subsets (including CD19(+) lymphocytes, n=21) and malignant B lymphocytes (including B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> [B-CLL], n=63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results obtained with this method were confirmed by Western and Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transactivation assays were performed using an expression construct for PLZF and two cyclin A promoter luciferase reporters in an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A expression, cell growth kinetics, and cell cycle were analysed in stable clones of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) B-cell line DG75 with inducible expression of PLZF, generated using the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulated expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of PLZF was 100-fold downregulated in 90% B-CLL (56/63) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-CLL patients with the highest levels of PLZF had a poorer survival (P&lt;0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In transactivation assays, PLZF inhibited the activity of the cyclin A reporters by 50%, demonstrating that PLZF can repress cyclin A expression in non-malignant B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in B-CLL patients, the level of cyclin A expression was found to be within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altered PLZF function in B lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was further corroborated in the PLZF-regulatable DG75 clones, where induction of PLZF expression did not significantly alter the levels of cyclin A expression, the cell growth kinetics, or the cell cycle phase distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lower survival of patients with the highest levels of PLZF suggests that this protein may be a marker of progression in B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of co-ordinated regulation of PLZF and cyclin A genes in B-CLL and in a malignant B-cell line may indicate a loss of cyclin A control by PLZF in B-CLL and other B-cell disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of PLZF could thus play a role in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
