<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of the children and 60% of the adults die from their disease, highlighting the need for new therapies that complement rather than overlap chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapy is a class of therapies where toxicities and mechanisms of action do not overlap with those of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because CD19 is a B cell- restricted membrane antigen that is expressed on the majority of pre-B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, a CD19-based immunotherapy is being developed for ALL </plain></SENT>
