<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and CD40 signaling in negative regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human Ramos B cells induced in response to different agents was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD40 ligation protected cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> through an initial, rapid and apparently Bcl-2-independent mechanism, associated with up-regulation of Bcl-XL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, rescue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by inhibition of macromolecular synthesis required several hours of prior stimulation with CD40 ligand/antibody and was accompanied by up-regulation of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-4 did not up-regulate Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and did not inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, IL-4 did protect Ramos cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> and this effect was accompanied by inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>-induced expression of an immediate early gene encoding a 36-kDa zinc-finger protein, Berg36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antisense blockade of Berg36 expression partially inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to an extent commensurate with the level of IL-4 protection, implicating Berg36 function as a requirement for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced through calcium signaling and as a target for IL-4 through which this cytokine inhibits <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These distinct mechanisms for rescue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD40 and IL-4 may help explain the co-operative roles of these T cell-derived signals for B cell survival </plain></SENT>
