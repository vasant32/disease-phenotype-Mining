<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of human general control of amino acid synthesis protein 5 (hGCN5) in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells in vitro, effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">Trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) on cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the molecular mechanism of TSA inhibiting proliferation of Daudi cells were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of TSA on the growth of Daudi cells were studied by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of TSA on the cell cycle of Daudi cells was assayed by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of hGCN5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of Daudi cells was decreased in TSA-treated group with a 24 h IC50 value of 415.3979 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TSA induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with TSA (200 and 400 microg/L) for 24 h, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates of Daudi cells were (14.74+/-2.04) % and (17.63+/-1.25) %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle was arrested in G0/G1 phase (50, 100 microg/L) and in G2/M phase (200 microg/L) by treatment with TSA for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of hGCN5 protein in Daudi cells was increased in 24 h TSA-treated group by immunochemistry and Western blot (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that TSA as HDACIs could increase the expression of hGCN5 in Daudi cells, and might play an important role in regulating the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of B-NHL cell line Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
