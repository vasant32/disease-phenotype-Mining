<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of 17 paediatric and 14 adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> with history and histopathology review, immunohistochemistry, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization (EBER) and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in gender, frequency of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement and leukaemic change at presentation, or frequency of CD10+/Bcl-2-/Bcl-6+ (88% versus 86%), Ki67 labelling index, EBER (24% versus 21%), or C-MYC translocation (100% versus 92%) between paediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correct pretreatment diagnoses were made in 13/17 (76%) paediatric and in 9/14 (64%) adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients received chemotherapy including 13/16 (81%) paediatric and 3/12 (25%) adult patients with appropriate regimens; 16 (57%) received <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant prognosticators were age (P = 0.001), with or without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis (P = 0.004), and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (P = 0.008) and leukaemic change (P = 0.019) in disease course </plain></SENT>
