<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined this issue using as a model the HLA-A11 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-A11 expression correlated with reduced susceptibility to NK and interferon-activated cytotoxicity in transfected sublines of the A11-defective Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> WW2-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and the HLA class I A,B-null C1R cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protection was also achieved by transfection of HLA-A11 in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> processing mutant T2 cells line (T2/A11), despite a very low expression of the transfected product at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of surface HLA-A11 by culture of T2/A11 cells at 26 degrees C or in the presence of beta 2m did not affect lysis, whereas NK sensitivity was restored by culture in the presence of HLA-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-binding synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid treatment rendered T2/A11 and C1R/A11 cells sensitive to lysis, but protection was restored after preincubation with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> preparations derived from surface stripping of T2/A11 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> preparations from T2 cells had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that NK protection is mediated by HLA-A11 molecules carrying a particular set of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that are translocated to the site of MHC class I assembly in the ER in a TAP-independent fashion </plain></SENT>
