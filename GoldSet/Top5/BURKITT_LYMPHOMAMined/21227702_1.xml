<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Structural derivatives of 4-MTA, an illegal <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> analogue have been previously shown to have anticancer effects in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we report the synthesis of a series of novel 1,3-bis(aryl)-2-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-1-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16052">propene</z:chebi> derivatives related in structure to 4-MTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of these compounds containing a classic nitrostyrene structure are shown to have antiproliferative activities in vitro in a range of malignant cell lines, particularly against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell lines, whilst having no effect on '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such effects appear to be independent of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter, a high affinity target for <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi> and independent of protein tyrosine phosphatases and tubulin dynamics both of which have been previously associated with nitrostyrene-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that a number of these compounds induce caspase activation, PARP cleavage, chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell line, consistent with these compounds inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no specific target has yet been identified for the action of these compounds, the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> elicited is potent, selective and worthy of further investigation </plain></SENT>
