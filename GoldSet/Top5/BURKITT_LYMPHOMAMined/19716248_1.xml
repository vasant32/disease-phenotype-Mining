<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients referred for FDG PET or FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) exams at our institution from June 2003 to June 2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selected patients were followed and clinical information was reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results from FDG PET-PET/CT, as blindly reviewed by a consensus of two experienced readers, were compared with the status of the disease as determined by other laboratory, clinical and imaging exams and clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FDG PET-PET/CT results were classified as true positive or negative and false positive or negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of FDG uptake in the positive lesions was semiquantified as maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven FDG PET-PET/CT exams were done in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven exams were done for initial staging, 8 during and 14 after the completion of therapy, and 28 for disease surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For nodal disease FDG PET-PET/CT was true positive in 8, true negative in 47 and false positive in 2 exams (sensitivity 100%, specificity 96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For extranodal disease FDG PET-PET/CT was true positive in 6, true negative in 48 and false positive in 3 exams (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean SUVmax for the positive nodal lesions was 15.7 (range 6.9-21.7, median 18.5) and for extranodal lesions was 14.2 (range 6.2-24.3, median 12.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET-PET/CT is sensitive for the detection of viable disease in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Affected areas demonstrated high degree of uptake that was reversible upon successful implementation of treatment </plain></SENT>
