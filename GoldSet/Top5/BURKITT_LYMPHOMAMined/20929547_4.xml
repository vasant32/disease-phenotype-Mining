<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein is required for the establishment of EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> in proliferating B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein that stimulates DNA replication at the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> origin of plasmid replication (OriP), regulates transcription of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular genes, and tethers the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> episome to the cellular chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 also provides a survival function to B-lymphocytes, potentially through its ability to alter cellular gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better understand these various functions of EBNA1, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular DNA sites associated with EBNA1 protein in a latently infected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with massively parallel deep-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) was used to identify cellular sites bound by EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sites identified by ChIP-Seq were validated by conventional real-time PCR, and ChIP-Seq provided quantitative, high-resolution detection of the known EBNA1 binding sites on the EBV genome at OriP and Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified at least one cluster of unusually high-affinity EBNA1 binding sites on chromosome 11, between the divergent FAM55 D and FAM55B genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A consensus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cellular EBNA1 binding sites is distinct from those derived from the known <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> binding sites, suggesting that some of these sites are indirectly bound by EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 also bound close to the transcriptional start sites of a large number of cellular genes, including HDAC3, CDC7, and MAP3K1, which we show are positively regulated by EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 binding sites were enriched in some repetitive elements, especially LINE 1 retrotransposons, and had weak correlations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and ORC binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EBNA1 can interact with a large number of cellular genes and chromosomal loci in latently infected cells, but that these sites are likely to represent a complex ensemble of direct and indirect EBNA1 binding sites </plain></SENT>
