<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the genomic structure of MYC/IGH fusions derived from a large series of 78 patients with t(8;14) and asked (i) whether distinct breakpoint clusters exist within the MYC gene and (ii) whether any pairwise association between particular IGH and MYC breakpoints exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of such associations will help elucidate the etiology of the breaks on the MYC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scan statistic analyses revealed two distinct, but large clusters within c-MYC containing 60/78 (77%) of the breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clusters 1 and 2 were 560 and 779 bp in length within a 4555 bp breakpoint cluster region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breaks within IGH switch mu and joining region did not differ with respect to their corresponding MYC breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a highly significant correlation between breakpoints 5' of MYC cluster 1 and fusions to IGH switch gamma region and breakpoints downstream of MYC cluster 2 and fusions to IGH switch alpha region (chi(2)-test: P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin changes governing choice of IGH-Fc region recombination may parallel changes in the MYC gene 5' region chromatin leading to some degree of coordinated ontological specificity in breakpoint location </plain></SENT>
