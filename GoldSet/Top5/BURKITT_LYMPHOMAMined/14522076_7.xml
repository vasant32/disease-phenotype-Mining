<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have mapped the gene for GCF2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to chromosome 2q37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the GCF2 gene and cDNA showed that the gene consists of eight exons and introns and spans 73 kbp of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis showed that GCF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was differentially expressed in many human tissues and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GCF2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was expressed as a 4.2 kb <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in most human tissues with the highest expression level in peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest expression in brain and testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional transcripts of 6.6, 2.9 and 2.4 kb were found in some tissues but the only transcript detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines was 4.2 kb with high levels found in seven Burkitts' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed that GCF2 protein is present at high levels in Burkitts' <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GCF2 was found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deletion mutants of GCF2 revealed that amino acids 429-528 are required for both DNA binding and repression of the EGFR promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GCF2 was able to substantially decrease activator protein 2 (AP2) enhancement of the EGFR promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, GCF2 is a transcriptional repressor overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines with a role in regulating expression of the EGFR </plain></SENT>
