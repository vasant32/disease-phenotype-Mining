<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case report is followed by a review of the literature on the problem of American and African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We can state that there is good correspondence between the white and black Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with regard to epidemiology, histopathology, therapy and some immunological aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups differ from each other in age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> manifestation, involvement of the bone marrow at time of diagnosis and quantitatively in the positive EBNA-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore suggested that black and white Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are not different diseases but different patterns of one disease </plain></SENT>
