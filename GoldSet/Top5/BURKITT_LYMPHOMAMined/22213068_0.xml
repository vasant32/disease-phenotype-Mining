<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A single nucleotide polymorphism-chip analysis of 98 cases of aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> revealed a recurrent deletion at 19p13 in nine of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six further cases with deletions encompassing this region were found in array-comparative genomic hybridization data of 295 aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three cases even showed a homozygous deletion, suggesting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in the deleted region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two genes encoding members of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor superfamily (TNFSF) were located in the minimally deleted region, that is, TNFSF7 and TNFSF9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As no mutations were found within the coding exons of the remaining alleles in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with heterozygous deletions, we speculate that the deletions may mostly function through a haploinsufficiency mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases with deletions encompassed both diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and a deletion was also found in a Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, TNFSF7 and TNFSF9 deletions are recurrent genetic lesions in multiple types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
