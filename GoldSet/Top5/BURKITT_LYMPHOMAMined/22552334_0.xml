<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children and adolescents in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) were extracted from 14 population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries (PBCRs) from 2000 to 2005, and included children and adolescents 0-19 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses included age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIRs) and age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) by each PBCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A social exclusion index (SEI) was built and used as proxy for socioeconomic status (SES) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between SES and incidence rates were investigated using Spearman's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 22.7/million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AAIRs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> varied from 12.9 (Salvador) to 34.5 per million (SÃ£o Paulo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median AAIR was 8.8/million, 9.8/million, and 2.9/million for NHL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PBCRs except that of Recife, AAIR was slightly higher in males than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median ASIR was highest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (18.5/million) at 15-19 years for both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For NHL there were two peaks for ASIR: 11.1/million (1-4 years of age) and 13.2/million (15-19 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median ASIR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was highest among children aged 1-4 years (4.7/million) and in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher SEI correlated with higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (P = 0.06), whereas rates of NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> did not correlate with SEI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Borderline different incidence rates were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> correlated with cities with higher SEIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Brazil do not differ compared to rates reported worldwide, although SES differences deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
