<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies have implicated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the great majority (80%-100%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) cases in South American countries, versus only 30%-40% in the United States and other industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333432" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">EBV-related malignancies</z:e> are known to be geographically localized, including nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in south China and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in equatorial Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies, however, have suggested that age and histiotype, rather than geographic region, are the major determinants of the association between EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further characterize this relationship in children, we matched 26 cases of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> from south Brazil and 26 cases from the U.S.-forhistiotype and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Brazilian children (22 males, 4 females) had a median age of 9 years, while the median age of the U.S. group (11 males, 15 females) was 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy material was examined for EBV early RNA1 (EBER1) expression by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This antigen was detected solely in Reed-Sternberg cells or their variants in positive samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same proportion of cases was positive (15/26 or 58%) in both groups of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for histiotype and age, the association between EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> remained independent of geographic location, but was more frequent in children aged &lt; or = 10 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the multiple-etiology hypothesis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
