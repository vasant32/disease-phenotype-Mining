<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are effective in killing B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cells in vitro, in vivo and in adult patients with B-lineage NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The potential of these agents for the treatment of childhood B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 ITs should have anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity against childhood B-lineage ALL since both target antigens are expressed on the surface of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that, in vitro these two ITs selectively kill <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells obtained from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficacy of our ITs in an in vivo model we injected the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell line, NALM-6-UM1, into severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We tested the ability of two ITs to prolong survival or cure mice of both early and advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In early disease, treatment with HD37-dgRTA, RFB4-dgRTA, or Combotox (an equimolar concentration of the two ITs) significantly improved their survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In advanced disease, treatment with RFB4-dgRTA or Combotox significantly improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall there were 10 long-term survivors who were cured, as determined by survival beyond 150 days with no evidence of disease as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
