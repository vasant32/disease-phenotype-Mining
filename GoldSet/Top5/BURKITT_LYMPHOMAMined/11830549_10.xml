<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Members of the BCL2 gene family influence cell viability and can, therefore, affect the susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to multiple chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is a challenge to devise approaches for inducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in which the expression of prosurvival family members is elevated or deregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BL41-3, a spontaneously derived subline of BL41 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, was found to have amplified the prosurvival MCL1 gene (3-fold) and overexpressed the MCL1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of MCL1 protein was 5-fold elevated compared with ML-1 cells expressing maximal MCL1 on exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>-13- <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess whether this increase in MCL1 expression was associated with enhanced protection from cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cells were exposed to conditions of growth factor deprivation or to various cytotoxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas BL41-3 and BL41 cells exhibited similar growth rates in logarithmic phase, BL41-3 cells remained largely viable on reaching saturation phase in contrast to BL41 cells, which began to die </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the BL41-3 subline remained viable for an extended period under conditions of reduced serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BL41-3 cells were also more resistant to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> (&gt;3-fold more than BL41 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, these cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi>, but only on exposure for an extended period (&gt;10-fold more sensitive than BL41 cells with a 24-h but not a 6-h exposure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, whereas cells expressing prosurvival BCL2 family members are frequently resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, the findings presented here, using a cell line exhibiting amplification and overexpression of MCL1, indicate that such cells may exhibit increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
