<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was marked by its high sensitivity to chemotherapy in comparison to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the treatment response and survival of patients with CMA protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five of the 105 children registered were evaluated for response; there were 46 boys and 39 girls, whose age at diagnosis ranged from 3 to 18 years (median 11 years), admitted to the Hematology National Teaching Hospital of Abidjan in the period 1998-2008 with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> on histological review and who were given CMA chemotherapy with curative intent are included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CMA protocol is a low intermediate regimen of 3 drugs [Cytarabin (ara-C), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>] with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-directed treatment by intrathecal MTX, ara-C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five of 85 patients obtained CR after induction therapy and 10 after 3 supplementary cycle because of partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall complete remission was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three of patients were alive in first CR at a median survival rate period of 2 years (range 82 days to 9 years) and are continuously disease free from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients relapse after CR and died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The projected 5-year overall survival rate was 62% </plain></SENT>
