<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of this factor in sera of vertebrates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we tested 48 EBV-genome-positive lymphoid cell lines of different origins for responsiveness to the serum factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only cells from lines of two groups, i.e. Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and EBV-transformed marmoset lines, responded to the factor, whereas human lymphoblastoid cell lines were not induced by the serum factor </plain></SENT>
