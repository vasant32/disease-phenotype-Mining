<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To approach the question whether the absence of specific cellular gene functions may be involved in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis, somatic cell hybrids were established between a malignant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60) and a nonmalignant EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line (IARC 277) derived from the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hybrids revealed a near tetraploid karyotype including one copy of the 8q+ chromosome resulting from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-specific translocation t(8;22) in addition to three apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> copies of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the hybrid cells exhibited the deregulated c-myc expression pattern of the parental Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with highly abundant transcripts originating from the 8q+ chromosome, their growth characteristics in tissue culture as well as in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were identical to that of the parental nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that, at least in the system described here, the malignant phenotype of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can be suppressed by introduction of an additional set of apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes from the same individual and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and c-myc deregulation may not be sufficient for maintenance of the malignant phenotype </plain></SENT>
