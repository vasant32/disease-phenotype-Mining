<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall extent of enzymatic DNA methylation was measured on the basis of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]deoxycytidine derived radioactivity incorporated into DNA 5-methylcytosine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic methylation of internal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> at 5'-CCGG-3' sequences of Raji DNA was analysed by use of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> restriction enzyme HpaII and its isoschizomer MspI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data obtained by both methods indicate that the treatment with MNU causes a lower level of enzymatic methylation of newly synthesized DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This lower extent of DNA methylation persists in the absence of the carcinogen in the cell cycles following the treatment </plain></SENT>
