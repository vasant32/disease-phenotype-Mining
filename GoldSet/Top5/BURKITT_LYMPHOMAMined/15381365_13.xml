<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently described a cluster of HPV18 integrations in the distal end of the common fragile site FRA8C at 8q24 in primary cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome band 8q24 contains the MYC gene (alias c-MYC), FRA8C, and FRA8D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MYC gene is frequently deregulated--usually by translocation or amplification--in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we performed a molecular cytogenetic analysis of HPV18 integration patterns and the 8q24 translocation in a primary cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and in HeLa cells using combined binary ratio-fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine how the chromosomal breaks involved in these events relate physically to the MYC gene; whether they map to the FRA8C site, the FRA8D site, or both; and how they correlate with the occurrence of DNA flexibility domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 8q24 translocation breakpoints mapped between stretches of integrated HPV18 sequences in the distal end of FRA8C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This region contained DNA helix flexibility clusters, several of which mapped in the vicinity of HPV integration sites and translocation breakpoints in cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA helix flexibility clusters were also found near known MYC translocation breakpoints in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), but most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> breakpoints mapped clearly outside FRA8C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed that FRA8C is involved in HPV integration and chromosomal translocations in cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; however, this fragile site is not involved in classical MYC translocations in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the context of the familial nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e>, FRA8C may be considered a candidate susceptibility region for cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
