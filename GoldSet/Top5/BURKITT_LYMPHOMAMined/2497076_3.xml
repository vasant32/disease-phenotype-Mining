<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous results at the protein level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines express heavy-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts of the mu class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a high mu s/mu m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> ratio was found in 2 IgM-producing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines (Raji and CCL85), that do not secrete immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variable region gene use was also assessed in the cell lines: while 4 out of 7 endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines use VH genes that belong to the VH3 gene family, no clear bias in the expression of particular VH or VL gene families among this sampling of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of immunoglobulin transcripts in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines did show that 2 such lines (AG876 and HTB62) expressed truncated heavy-chain transcripts; <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequence analysis of the VH region demonstrated different abnormal 5'-localized <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing events for the 2 shortened mu transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The light-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in these 2 cell lines also showed structural abnormalities and, in the case of HTB62, 3 different kappa light-chain transcripts are produced (of elongated, native and truncated sizes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro translation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from HTB62 showed mu and kappa chain proteins corresponding with the relative size for each message </plain></SENT>
