<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined somatic cell hybrids between Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and either human lymphoblastoid cells or mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cells for the expression of the translocated c-myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that the translocated c-myc oncogene is transcribed in plasma cells but is repressed in lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the factors necessary for translocated c-myc transcription are present in plasma cells and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells but are absent or inactive in lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the distance between the rearranged immunoglobulin loci and the c-myc oncogene can even exceed 30-50 kilobases, we speculate that the translocated c-myc oncogene is under the transcriptional control of enhancer-like elements capable of acting over long distances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of this long-range enhancer may depend on the interaction with transacting factors that are active in plasma cells and in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells but are not active in lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also examined the transcription of the first exon of the c-myc oncogene, which becomes separated from the second and third exon because of the chromosomal break involving the first intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This exon is transcribed at high levels in ST486 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with the t(8;14) chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hybrids between lymphoblastoid and ST486 cells expressed high levels of transcripts of the first exon, whereas hybrids between plasma cells and ST486 cells did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, transcription of the separated first exon can be enhanced in lymphoblastoid and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells because of its close proximity to the heavy chain enhancer that is normally located between the joining and the switch region of the C mu gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such enhancement, however, does not occur in plasma cells, possibly because these cells are able to suppress completely the c-myc oncogene, unless it has been placed in the proximity of a rearranged immunoglobulin constant region gene </plain></SENT>
