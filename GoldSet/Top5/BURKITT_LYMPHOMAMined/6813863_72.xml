<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have produced cell hybrids between mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells, which do not produce immunoglobulin chains, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Daudi), which express surface IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daudi Cells carry a reciprocal chromosome translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14, described as (8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hybrids were studied for the expression of human immunoglobulin chains and human isozyme markers, for the presence of human chromosomes, and for the presence of the human genes for heavy chain variable regions (VH) and mu and gamma chain constant (C) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the expressed mu chain gene is on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 14 in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also determined that the chromosome 14 involved in the translocation (14q+) carries the gene for C mu and C gamma 1-4 and probably several genes for the variable region (V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Certain hybrids had lost both the chromosomes 14 but had retained the abnormal chromosome 8 (8q-) that carries the terminal end of the long arm of chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These hybrids were studied for the presence of human VH, C mu,, and C gamma DNA sequences, and the results indicated that the hybrid cells with the 8q- chromosome contained VH genes that not C genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that, in the Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the break in chromosome 14 occurred within the chromosome segment containing V region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result of the translocation some of these VH genes became associated with chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is caused by immunoglobulin V region gene translocation resulting in activation of a gene on the long arm of human chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
