<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The functional significance of the Pvt1 locus in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> has remained a puzzle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, Pvt1 is the site of reciprocal translocations to immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the locus encodes a number of alternative transcripts, no protein or regulatory <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> products were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The recent identification of non-coding microRNAs encoded within the PVT1 region has suggested a regulatory role for this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mouse Pvt1 locus encodes several microRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mouse T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> induced by retroviral insertions into the locus, the Pvt1 transcripts, and at least one of their microRNA products, mmu-miR-1204 are overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas up to seven co-mutations can be found in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1298180" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">single tumor</z:e>, in over 2,000 tumors none had insertions into both the Myc and Pvt1 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Judging from the large number of integrations into the Pvt1 locus - more than in the nearby Myc locus - Pvt1 and the microRNAs encoded by it are as important as Myc in T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, and, presumably, in T cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the co-mutations in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> likely place Pvt1 and Myc into the same pathway </plain></SENT>
