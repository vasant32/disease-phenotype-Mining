<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated with various B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> such as post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-lymphocyte reprogramming by EBV involves the control of numerous cellular genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify such EBV-deregulated genes, we have compared the gene expression profile of EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) (BL2, BL30, BL70) with their EBV-converted counterpart (BL2-B95, BL30-B95, BL70-B95) by cDNA array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of the results was made using Ward's cluster analysis method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the expression of up to 26% of the 1176 cellular genes analyzed may be modified in EBV-converted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within this set of genes, a subset of genes markedly regulated in EBV-converted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells was defined as those for which expression in EBV+ cells was increased or decreased more than 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of various genes was modulated in agreement with their previously reported regulation by EBV or by transcription factors activated by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numerous genes were newly identified as modulated in EBV-converted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of these results were verified by both semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, and were consistent with functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional classification of EBV-regulated genes gave a comprehensive picture of cellular reprogramming by EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, by pointing out cellular modules such as cell cycle, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and signal transduction pathways, including BCR and TNF receptor family and interferon pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, cDNA array results point to three families of transcription factors, Rel/NF-kappaB, STAT1, and Ets-related proteins Spi-B, Elf-1, and Ets-1 as putative cellular targets of EBV </plain></SENT>
