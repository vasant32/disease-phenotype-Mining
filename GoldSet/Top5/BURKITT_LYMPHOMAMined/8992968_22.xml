<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these mHag are restricted to hemopoietic cells, others show a broad tissue expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, antileukemia reactivity is often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the identification of a B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated mHag, HB-1, recognized by a CD8+ CTL clone derived from peripheral blood of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patient who has been treated by HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the CTL clone that recognizes HB-1 exhibits specific cytotoxicity toward leukemic as well as EBV-transformed B cells, but not against untransformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CTL clone does not lyse PHA-stimulated T cell blasts, monocytes, and fibroblasts, indicating that HB-1 is mainly expressed by transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis reveals that HB-1 is restricted by HLA-B44 (both B*4402 and B*4403) and that 28% of HLA-B44-positive individuals express HB-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated mHag with a restricted tissue distribution, such as HB-1, elicit CTL reactivity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These Ags are of potential use in immunotherapy against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> because they generate antileukemia reactivity that is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
