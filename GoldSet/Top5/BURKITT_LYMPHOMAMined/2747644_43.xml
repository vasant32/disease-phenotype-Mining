<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the cloning and molecular characterization of a chromosome 8 region, distal from the c-myc locus, which encompasses the breakpoints of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines BL64, BL21, and LY91 within 11 kilobase pairs, termed provisionally bvr-1 (Burkitt's variants' rearranging region 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using probes from the c-myc, the bvr-1, and the human pvt-1 loci obtained by chromosome walking coupled with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we have constructed a physical map of the region 3' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We map bvr-1 and pvt-1 about 140 and 260 kilobase pairs, respectively, distal from c-myc </plain></SENT>
