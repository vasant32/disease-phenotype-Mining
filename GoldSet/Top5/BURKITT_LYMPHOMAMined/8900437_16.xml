<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired presentation of an immunodominant HLA A11-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> from the resident or recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus-expressed Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA)4 was demonstrated in the EBV-positive E95B-BL28 and its EBV-negative parental BL28 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether this was due to (i) impaired production of the antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, (ii) poor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> translocation into the ER lumen or (iii) inefficient maturation and transport of the MHC-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> complexes at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The defect was not overcome by cytosolic expression of a pre-formed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, suggesting that presentation of EBNA4 is not limited by inefficient production of the antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BL28 expressed 5- to 10-fold lower levels of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) 1 and TAP2 proteins and behaved poorly in a streptolysin-O-mediated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> translocation assay, whereas E95B-BL28 showed higher TAP expression and virtually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transporter function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of HLA A11 and reconstitution of TAP activity by treatment with IFN-gamma did not restore presentation of the resident EBNA4 in E95SB-BL28 and did not enhance presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus-expressed intact protein or preformed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficient maturation of class I molecules to Endo H-resistant species was demonstrated in pulse-chase experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings identify a previously uncharacterized defect of antigen presentation which appears to affect events occurring after proteasomal degradation but before TAP-dependent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transport and MHC class I assembly and maturation </plain></SENT>
