<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with the development of two human B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that occur in the immunosuppressed host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter category of disease has become important recently as it is seen primarily in organ transplant recipients and individuals with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> development involves a reduction in or lack of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In support of this model are previous observations that the expression of EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and latent membrane protein, two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted T-cell killing, are downregulated in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in early passage lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from the malignant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a similar mechanism could occur in the development of posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (PTLD), we compared EBV gene expression among 23 PTLD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lesions obtained from 11 solid organ transplant recipients and among LCL derived from 3 of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate, by Southern blot, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis, that (1) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lesions exhibit varying patterns of restricted <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression; (2) LCL derived from these lesions may represent the in vitro selection of cell subpopulations; and (3) immunosuppressed individuals have a markedly reduced antibody response to the latent cycle antigens, EBNA1, EBNA2, and EBNA-LP, but not to the lytic cycle <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunocompetent controls </plain></SENT>
