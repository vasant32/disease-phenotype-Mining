<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> gene (WT1) expression in B cells and its importance for growth regulation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated WT1 expression in fresh B lymphocytes and in a panel of B-cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant origin, including both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WT1 is constitutively activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from EBV immortalization of lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cell lines are distinguished for the presence of activated B-cell markers and an unrestricted expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WT1 expression is abrogated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> derived cell lines, irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status and their phenotype pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single step RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of the four spliced transcript isoforms has been applied to confirm their expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variant relative proportions suggested the maintenance of a balanced expression of the isoforms in LCL, as reported in non tumorous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data, together with the evidence that the replication in vitro of lymphoblastoid cells is not affected by WT1 activation following <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> immortalization, support the hypothesis that gene inactivation, in addition to disrupted alternate splicing, may play a role in growth control derangements </plain></SENT>
