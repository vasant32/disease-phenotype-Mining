<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a yeast two-hybrid system screen for Cdc42-interacting proteins, we identified a protein with similarity to the CrkII-binding protein DOCK180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cDNA clone of this protein, designated DOCK8, encoded a gene-product of 1701 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 190 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining showed that transiently transfected HA-tagged DOCK8, as well as endogenous DOCK8, was present at the cell edges in areas undergoing lamellipodia formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection of a C-terminal fragment of DOCK8 resulted in the formation of vesicular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these vesicles also contained filamentous actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an involvement of DOCK8 in processes that affect the organisation of filamentous actin </plain></SENT>
