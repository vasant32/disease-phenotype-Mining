<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its presentation in the abdomen and pelvis has not been previously detailed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively identified cases of abdominal-pelvic LPD in lung transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were characterized clinically, and the outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abdominal-pelvic LPD was identified in 19 of 603 adult patients who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at Barnes-Jewish Hospital between July 1, 1988 and December 31, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time from transplantation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of LPD was 5.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cases presented early after transplantation (median, 175 days), and 16 cases presented late (median, 2,255 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time to diagnosis of LPD was significantly shorter for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative than for EBV-seropositive recipients (median, 175 vs. 2255 days; log-rank, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases were non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, one was a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one was an atypical lymphoid proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 cases, 12 involved the gastrointestinal tract and 7 occurred in other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy was decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven underwent surgical resection, and nine received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients have died, and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median time from the diagnosis of LPD to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 68 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal-pelvic LPD is typically a late complication after lung transplantation; however, when it occurs early, it may be related to a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This form of LPD is most frequently a non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and despite aggressive therapy, the prognosis is poor </plain></SENT>
