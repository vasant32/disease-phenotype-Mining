<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We defined the surgical approach in this rare localization of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> secondary to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated at the Yopougon University Hospital from October 1990 to October 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 15.4 years, range 8 to 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 patients were children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery was both a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency in this rare but serious localization of Burkitt's disease, which remains highly chemosensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical management is warranted if Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is revealed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> or if there is a primary spinal epidural localization </plain></SENT>
