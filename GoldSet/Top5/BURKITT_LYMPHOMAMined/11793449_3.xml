<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To ascertain the number and location of other genome alterations, we used 191 polymorphic markers in a genome-wide search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 31 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were able to distinguish two types of altered allelic patterns: a bona fide LOH profile, indicative of deletion (LOH), and a profile indicative of increased dosage (ID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former type was most frequent at chromosome arm 17p, most likely indicating TP53 gene inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased dosage at 1q was found almost exclusively in non-EBV cell lines (P &lt; 0.00004) and correlated well with karyotypic abnormalities affecting region 1q21-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a gene important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> pathogenesis is located in region 1q21-25 and that the activation of this gene mimics the effects of EBV </plain></SENT>
