<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Out of 58 enrolled patients, 51 were diagnosed as having DLBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) was diagnosed in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with DLBL (10 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> and 25 without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>) and 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were treated with the CHOP/R-CHOP regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NHL-BFM-90 program was used in 3 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and 16 with DLBL (15 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> and 1 patient without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After radiotherapy, the patient with marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> achieved a 20-month remission; three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients receiving CHOP died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients receiving NHL-BFM-90 achieved complete remissions of 48 to 72 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients having DLBL without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, who received CHOP, five-year overall and event-free survival rates were 100%; in 22 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, these were 50 and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the patients with and without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, who received CHOP/R-CHOP, the survival rates differed statistically significantly (p = 0.01; logrank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group of 15 patients having DLBL with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, who were treated with the NHL-BFM-90 protocol, 14 achieved an average remission of 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the patients having DLBL with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> who used NHF-BFM-90, therapeutic efficiency was significantly higher (p = 0.05; Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differential therapy for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of bones and soft tissues indicated that the NHL-BFM-90 protocol used in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> group was significantly more effective than the CHOP regimens </plain></SENT>
