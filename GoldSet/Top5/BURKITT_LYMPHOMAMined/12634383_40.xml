<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is a known regulatory transcription factor that has been shown to interact with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) when cotransfected in human cell lines and by in vitro binding experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that EBNA3C interacts with p300 and prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) in EBV-infected cells and may be involved in recruiting acetyltransferases to the chromatin for acetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> and transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA3C has also been shown to function as a repressor of transcription when directed to promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that EBNA3C complexed with ProTalpha can also recruit deacetylase activity and associates in a complex that includes HDAC1 and HDAC2 in human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A complex of EBNA3C and ProTalpha coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in cell lines stably expressing EBNA3C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this complex associated with the mSin3A and NCoR corepressors in EBNA3C-expressing cell lines and may function in a complex with additional transcription factors known to be repressors of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA3C in complex with ProTalpha recruited deacetylase activity in cell lines stably expressing EBNA3C, and this activity was shown to be partially sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests an association with other deacetylases that are insensitive to the general inhibitory effects of TSA, as the entire activity was not abolished in multiple assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between EBNA3C and the corepressors as well as HDACs is likely to depend on the presence of ProTalpha in the complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with anti-ProTalpha antibody immunoprecipitated EBNA3C and the other repressors, whereas immunoprecipitation with anti-EBNA3C antibody resulted in little or no association with these molecules associated with transcription repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clearly, EBNA3C functions as a component of a number of dynamic complexes which function in repression and activation of transcription </plain></SENT>
