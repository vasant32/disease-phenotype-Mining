<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that EBV-positive Akata and Mutu cell clones expressed higher levels of interleukin (IL)-10 than their EBV-negative subclones at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfection of an individual EBV latent gene into EBV-negative Akata cells revealed that EBERs were responsible for IL-10 induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant IL-10 enabled EBV-negative Akata cells to grow in low (0.1%) serum conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, growth of EBV-positive Akata cells was blocked by treatment either with an anti-IL-10 antibody or antisense oligonucleotide against IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsies consistently expressed IL-10, but EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsies did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IL-10 induced by EBERs acts as an autocrine growth factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBERs, EBER1 and EBER2, are non-polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> and are 166 and 172 nucleotides long, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> molecules could regulate cell growth </plain></SENT>
