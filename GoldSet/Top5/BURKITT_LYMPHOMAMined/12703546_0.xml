<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell lines, BALM-19, -20, -21, -22, -23 (BALM 19-23) and BALM-26 were established from a patient with B-cell characteristics of ALL L2 type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were derived from bone marrow specimens, BALM 19-23 from a sample taken at diagnosisand BALM-26 from one at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the established lines present various B-cell characteristics, being positive for cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) chains but also for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; hence the cell lines should be assigned to B-cell category B-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a unique feature, the cell lines expressed the CD33 myeloid antigen in addition to the common B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> antigen expression among the different cell lines was found regarding CD35, CD39, CD45RA, CD78 and CD95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The malignant nature of the cell lines was documented by negativity for the Epstein-Barr virus and by the occurrence of clonal non-random structural chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's serum showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo>, prompting further investigation of the established cell lines which expressed parathyroid hormone related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PTHrP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The established B-cell ALL sister cell lines, BALM 19-23 and BALM-26, could provide useful material for clarifying the pathogenesis of this type of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scientific significance of this panel of cell lines lies in the availability of a series of clonally derived but phenotypically different sister cell lines established at different phases of the disease </plain></SENT>
