<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a complication of bone marrow transplantation that responds poorly to standard forms of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is usually of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that treatment with infusions of donor leukocytes, which contain cytotoxic T cells presensitized to EBV, might be an effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied five patients in whom EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> developed after they received a T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were immunophenotyped, subjected to the polymerase chain reaction to determine the origin of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (donor or host) and to detect the presence of EBV, and analyzed by Southern blotting for the presence of the clonal EBV genome and immunoglobulin-gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with infusions of unirradiated donor leukocytes at doses calculated to provide approximately 1.0 x 10(6) CD3+ T cells per kilogram of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients demonstrated monomorphic, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each of the four specimens that could be evaluated was of donor-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evidence of clonality was found in two of the three samples adequate for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients there were complete pathological or clinical responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The responses were first documented histologically within 8 to 21 days after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical remissions were achieved within 14 to 30 days after the infusions and were sustained without further therapy in the three surviving patients for 10, 16, and 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a small number of patients, infusions of unirradiated donor leukocytes were an effective treatment for EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> that arose after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
