<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seven lymphoid cell lines previously characterized with respect to their resident Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome content were infected or superinfected with concentrated EBV from supernatant of the P3HR-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence assays were conducted on smears 48 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, using human sera containing antibodies to EBV early antigen (EA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) negative cell lines containing no detectable resident EBV DNA and five EBNA positive cell lines containing EBV genomes were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell lines did not spontaneously express EBV EA (i.e., they were non-producers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines responded to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with EBV by expressing EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the cell lines with arabinosylcytosine (Ara-C) 10 micrograms/ml, at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> resulted in significant decreases in the number of cells expressing detectable EA after drug treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines (72 +/- 5 percent inhibition of EA expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments were also conducted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that treatment with HU (100 micrograms/ml) inhibited EA production in cell lines containing EBV genome copies by 81 percent as compared to the superinfected cultures receiving no drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> of EBNA negative cell lines, HU had minimal effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> (100 micrograms/ml), on the other hand, had very little effect on EA expression following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of cell lines harboring the EBV genome, but reduced the EA expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> of EBNA negative cell lines by 70 to 80 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drugs were used at concentrations having little effect on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, HU and Ara-C significantly reduced DNA synthesis and cell division in the treated cultures </plain></SENT>
