<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1992 to June 1997, 26 consecutive adults with newly diagnosed untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> received hyperfractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Hyper-CVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 58 years (range, 17 to 79 years), and 46% were &gt; or = 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received Hyper-CVAD alternated with courses of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and prophylactic antibiotics were administered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight planned courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis alternated intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> on days 2 and 7 of each course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 21 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were five induction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to CR was 22 days (range, 15 to 89 days); 70% achieved CR within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate was 49% (+/- 11%); the 3-year continuous CR rate was 61% (+/- 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve CR patients (57%) were in continuous CR at a median follow-up of 3+ years (range, 13+ months to 6.5+ years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Characteristics predicting for worse survival were age &gt; or = 60 years, poor performance status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, peripheral blasts, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>increased lactate dehydrogenase level</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rate was 77% for 14 patients younger than 60 years and 17% for 12 patients &gt; or = 60 years (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis identified older age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and presence of peripheral blasts as independent factors associated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients could be stratified according to (1) no or one adverse feature, (2) two adverse features, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adverse features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival rates were 89%, 47%, and 0%, respectively (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
