<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 on the proliferation of human B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The panel was selected to give information whether (1) their origin, (2) their phenotype, (3) their Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrier state, influence their responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The growth of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) was not inhibited by TGF-beta 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBV-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines, Daudi, Jijoye, Rael but not Raji were inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and the majority of their converted sublines were sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell lines tested expressed TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta 1 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of EBV-infected B cells was inhibited by TGF-beta, their sensitivity decreased, however, after 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the activation state of the B cells is decisive for TGF-beta sensitivity and EBV influences it indirectly by changing the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
