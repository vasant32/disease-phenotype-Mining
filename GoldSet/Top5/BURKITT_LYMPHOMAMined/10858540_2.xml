<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to analyze the primary response of Raji cells to that stimulus, a cDNA array screen and a suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR approach were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four genes with assigned functions were confirmed to be induced by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> in reverse Northern blot experiments covering e.g. protein kinase B, phospholipase C, the MAP-kinase ERK3, the transcription factors YY1, DR1 and NSEP, the membrane traffic protein TAP, and the nuclear export protein CRM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the genes identified are involved in signal transduction, transcription, and cell trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For selected genes, the induction of expression was quantified by semiquantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
