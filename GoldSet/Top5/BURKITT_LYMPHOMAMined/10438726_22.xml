<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ligation of human CD22 with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that block the ligand binding site triggers rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and primary B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) couple upstream signaling pathways to gene activation and are activated by B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling, we examined whether CD22 ligation also activated ERKs and/or modified BCR-induced ERK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ligation of CD22 on either primary B cells or B-cell lines failed to significantly activate the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK-2, but did activate the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; c-jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinases or JNKs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BCR ligation resulted in ERK-2 activation without significant SAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concurrent ligation of CD22 and BCR enhanced BCR-mediated ERK-2 activation without appreciably modulating CD22-induced SAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with its induction of SAPK activity, there was a marked increase in nuclear extracts of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and c-jun levels within 2 hours of exposure of primary B cells to the CD22 MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite their differences in ERK activation, both CD22 and BCR ligation triggered several Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and the 2 stimuli together induced greater cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than either signal alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pro-apoptotic effects were CD22-blocking MoAb-specific and dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of expression levels of Bcl-2 protoncogene family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Mcl-1, and Bax) showed a downregulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 after CD22 ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides a plausible mechanism to explain how CD22 and BCR signaling can costimulate B-cell proliferation and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
