<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many C- and D-type retroviruses are known to cause a broad spectrum of malignant diseases in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain genome regions of these animal retroviruses are highly conserved between different animal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It should be possible to detect new members of the retrovirus family with consensus PCR primers derived from these conserved sequence motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The consensus PCR primers developed in this study are generic enough to detect nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known oncogenic mammalian and avian exogenous C- and D-type retroviruses but do not amplify human endogenous retroviral sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous investigations, the present study involved highly stringent PCR conditions and truly generic PCR primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four samples from patients with various immunophenotyped malignant diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> T-/B-cell lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemias</z:mpath>, T-/B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>) and three cell lines (Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) have thus far been investigated using these PCR primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that no retroviruses have been found argues against an involvement of known animal oncoretroviruses or related hitherto undetected human retroviruses in the aetiopathogenesis of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The retrovirus detection system developed here may be used to confirm suspected retroviral involvement in other (malignant or nonmalignant) human diseases as well as to identify new animal retroviruses </plain></SENT>
