<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between the clinical and immunophenotypic features of 43 BL/BLL patients by immunohistochemical staining for bcl-2 and double staining for Ki-67 plus caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In double staining experiments, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were divided into high and low groups for the expression of caspase-3, Ki-67, and both Ki-67 and caspase-3, by using the medians of their percentages as limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 43 BL/BLL patients were divided into high caspase-3 (n = 19) and low caspase-3 (n = 24) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the overall survival between the high (77%) and low caspase-3 (33%) groups; the survival rate of patients in the low caspase-3 group who received aggressive short-term chemotherapy (58%) was significantly better than that of patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (CHOP) therapy (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients positive for bcl-2 were in the low caspase-3 group (high caspase-3 group, 0%; low caspase-3 group, 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival tended to be better in the high caspase-3 and bcl-2-negative group (76%) than in the low caspase-3 and bcl-2-negative (50%) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the low caspase-3 and bcl-2-positive group tended to show the worst prognosis (16%) </plain></SENT>
