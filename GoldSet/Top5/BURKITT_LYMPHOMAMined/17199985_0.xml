<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of the line CA46 were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of CD40 molecule on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells were put into 96-well plate and added with solutions of srhCD40L of the terminal concentrations of 0.04 microg/ml, 0.2 microg/ml, 1.0 microg/ml, and 5.0 microg/ml respectively, and 24, 28, 72, 96, and 120 hours later cell growth curve was drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to other CA46 cells co-incubated with srhCD40L of the terminal concentrations of 0.04 microg/ml, 0.2 microg/ml, 1.0 microg/ml, and 5.0 microg/ml respectively so as to calculate the proliferation inhibition rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells were treated with srhCD40L of the concentrations of 1.0 microg/ml for 24, 48, and 72 hours respectively, FCM was used to analyze the DNA cycle and TUNEL was used to calculate the apoptotic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annexin-V labeling method was used to detect the positive rate of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells were treated with srhCD40L of the concentration of 1 microg/ml for 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of survivin, an anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein, and the protein expression of survivin was detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression rate of CD40 in the human Burkitt CA46 cells was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>srhCD40L dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of the CD46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treated by srhCD40L, the progress of cells at S stage into G(2)/M stage was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TUNEL showed that treated by srhCD40L (1.0 microg/ml) for 24, 48, and 72 hours the apoptotic rates of the cells were 9%, 18%, and 35% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Annexin-V showed that after incubation with srhCD40L (1.0 microg/ml) for 24 h the apoptotic rate was 10.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two apoptotic peaks appeared 48 and 72 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that the survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and protein expression were both down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligation of CD40 by srhCD40L inhibits the proliferation of malignant hematogenous cells and induces their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Expression of survivin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein may be related to cell growth inhibition and to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by Ligation of CD40 by srhCD40L </plain></SENT>
