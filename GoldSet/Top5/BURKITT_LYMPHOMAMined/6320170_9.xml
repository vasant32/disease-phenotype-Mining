<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-genome-negative human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, Ramos and BJAB, can be converted by EBV in vitro into EBV-genome-positive virus nonproducer lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell lines have been used to identify surface antigens unique to EBV, with the expectation that such determinants might be related to the antigenic target responsible for EBV-specific immunosurveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antisera prepared in rabbits immunized with either whole cells or purified plasma membranes were used in immunoblot experiments to analyze antigenic differences resulting from expression of the resident EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, an increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 32 and 70 kilodaltons was consistently observed in the EBV-converted Ramos lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these antigens were not expressed in BJAB or in its EBV-converted lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that p32 and gp70 might be murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (MuLV)-coded antigens because Ramos, but not BJAB, had been passaged in athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice during establishment of this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was confirmed by using antisera specific for MuLV p30 and gp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retroviral antigens were expressed constitutively at low levels in Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunoblotting showed that EBV conversion of Ramos amplified the expression of MuLV proteins 3- to 5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism responsible for the enhanced expression is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The biological relevance of this phenomenon is also not clear, but the interaction between a DNA and a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> virus in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line that carries both viruses may have important biological consequences in relation to retrovirus latency and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results also show that caution must be used when ascribing "uniqueness" to EBV-determined antigens, particularly in the Ramos lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This warning extends also to the use of Ramos cell lines as immunogens, because immunization of rabbits elicited antibodies that recognized proteins of the same size as the retroviral antigens </plain></SENT>
