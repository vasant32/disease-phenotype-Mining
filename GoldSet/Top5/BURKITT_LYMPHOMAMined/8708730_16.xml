<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The relative cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared the direct antileukemic activities of these compounds in stroma-supported cultures of leukemic lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from children with B-lineage ALL were cultured on allogeneic bone marrow-derived stromal layers and exposed to various concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 4 days of culture, the number of viable leukemic cells was counted by flow cytometry and compared with that in parallel cultures without drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 28 B-lineage ALL samples tested, the concentration producing 50% cytotoxicity (LC50) of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> ranged from 2.0 to 7,978 nmol/L (median, 43.5 nmol/L), and that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> from 0.6 to 327 nmol/L (median, 7.5 nmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the wide variability of responses among samples, there was an excellent correlation between LC50 values obtained with the two drugs (linear r = .99, P &lt; .0001; Spearman rank-order r = .77, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median ratio of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> LC50 and LC90 values was 1:5.5 (range, 1:1.0 to 1:24.4 for LC50; 1:1.1 to 1:25.5 for LC90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies with ALL cell lines demonstrated that both drugs were cytotoxic through induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stromal layers did not absorb or inactivate measurable amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, which indicates that the assay system did not bias results toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521857" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">increased drug resistance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a bone marrow-derived microenvironment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> is five to six times more cytotoxic (on a molar basis) than <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, in agreement with the antiinflammatory activities of these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding may serve to guide the selection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> dosage in the treatment of ALL </plain></SENT>
