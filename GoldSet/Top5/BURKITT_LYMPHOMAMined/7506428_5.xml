<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As presently reported, both ionizing radiation and engagement of the CD19 receptor are capable of inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both instances, activation of tyrosine kinases appears to be a proximal and mandatory step, since it can be prevented by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This common biochemical signaling pathway involves the rapid activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase LCK (p56lck), which is physically associated with the CD19 receptor, and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates leading to stimulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> turnover, and activation of protein kinase C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, engagement of the CD19 receptor promoted radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in radiation-resistant B-lineage ALL cells in a cell type-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results prompt the hypothesis that clonogenic B-lineage ALL blasts with an inherent or acquired resistance to radiation could be radiosensitized in clinical settings using anti-CD19 MoAb B43 or its homoconjugate as adjuncts </plain></SENT>
