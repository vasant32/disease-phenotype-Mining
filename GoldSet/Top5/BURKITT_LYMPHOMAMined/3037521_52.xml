<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells are relatively or completely resistant to the lytic effect of major histocompatibility complex class I HLA antigen-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated by stimulating lymphocytes of EBV-seropositive donors with the autologous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found that EBV-negative and EBV-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines derived from HLA-A11-positive donors were not only resistant to lysis by the HLA-A11-restricted CTL generated by stimulation with the autologous LCL, but also to HLA-A11-specific CTL derived from lymphocytes of an EBV-seronegative donor stimulated with an allogeneic LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the same and additional cell lines, we now show that the CTL resistance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines is probably due to a selective down-regulation of HLA-A11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also show that the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed at a lower level in the EBV-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines than in EBV-transformed LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one of eight in vitro EBV-converted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines that shifted to a more LCL-like growth pattern expressed LMP at a high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This line also reexpressed the HLA-A11 antigen that was undetectable in its EBV-negative progenitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> is associated with low expression of both proteins </plain></SENT>
