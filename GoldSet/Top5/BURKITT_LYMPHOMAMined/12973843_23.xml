<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), standard-dose chemotherapy for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-associated diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is becoming the standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the safety and efficacy of intensive regimens have not been established for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), a highly aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for which moderate-dose chemotherapy is substandard in the HIV-negative population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate the feasibility of intensive chemotherapy in HIV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, the authors retrospectively reviewed 14 HIV-positive adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> treated at their center between 1988 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were treated between 1996 and 2000 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (CODOX-M/IVAC), one of the currently preferred intensive-dose chemotherapy regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six received other chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared with those of 24 HIV-negative adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> who had similar patient characteristics and were treated concomitantly (13 with CODOX-M/IVAC; 11 with other regimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 HIV-positive patients, 63% had a complete response after CODOX-M/IVAC treatment, compared with 67% of patients receiving other chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 60% and 60% after CODOX-M/IVAC or other regimens, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar outcomes were seen despite the fact that 88% of CODOX-M/IVAC-treated HIV-positive patients had Stage IV disease, compared with one-third of HIV-positive patients treated with other chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HIV status did not adversely affect long-term EFS independent of the treatment regimen (P = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When EFS was evaluated according to chemotherapy regimen independent of HIV status, CODOX-M/IVAC was found to be associated with improved EFS (P = 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and particularly those at high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HIV-positive patients treated with CODOX-M/IVAC tolerated chemotherapy well with similar rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and infectious complications as HIV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current nonrandomized retrospective study suggested that intensive chemotherapy with CODOX-M/IVAC is feasible and well tolerated in HIV-positive adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the post-HAART era, intensive chemotherapy such as CODOX-M/IVAC may be appropriate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and especially those with poor prognostic factors, regardless of HIV status </plain></SENT>
