<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established a cell line, which we named 380, from a young male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (FAB type L2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Karyologic analysis of this cell line indicates that it carries an 8;14 and a 14;18 chromosome translocation, which are characteristic of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cell line is Epstein-Barr virus antigen-negative, reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific for B cells, and contains rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes, but does not express human immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this cell line, both mu heavy chain constant (C mu) loci are rearranged within the joining (JH) DNA segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the JH segments on one of the 14q+ chromosomes is rearranged with a segment of chromosome 8, where the c-myc oncogene resides, while the other is rearranged with a segment of chromosome 18 where a putative oncogene, which we have called bcl-2, is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The c-myc oncogene, which is translocated to one of the 14q+ chromosomes, is in its germ-line configuration more than 14 kilobases away from both the JH segment and the heavy chain enhancer that is located between the JH and mu switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we propose a model of some aspects of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> according to which B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> carrying translocations involving the heavy chain loci on both human chromosomes 14 are the result of a multiple step process </plain></SENT>
