<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the N-terminal domain of c-Myc has been shown to interact with microtubules in vivo, and the binding of c-Myc to alpha-tubulin was localized to amino acids 48 to 135 within the c-Myc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that c-Myc proteins harboring a naturally occurring mutation at Thr-58 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines have increased stability and are constitutively hyperphosphorylated, which disrupts the in vivo interaction of c-Myc with alpha-tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> c-Myc-alpha-tubulin interactions are also disrupted during a transient mitosis-specific hyperphosphorylation of c-Myc, which resembles the constitutive hyperphosphorylation pattern of Thr-58 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
