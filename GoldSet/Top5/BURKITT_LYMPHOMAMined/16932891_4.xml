<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite these improvements, the outcome for children with recurrent or refractory NHL remains dismal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the use of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (HDC/PBSCT) for children with either refractory or recurrent NHL, and we evaluated various factors influencing outcome of HDC/PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients underwent HDC/PBSCT in 11 institutes were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had refractory or recurrent NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sex, stage at diagnosis, histologic subtype (lymphoblastic, Burkitt's, and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), LDH level at diagnosis, disease status at transplantation, and preparative regimens for HDC/PBSCT were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In regard to the patients, six had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 13 had lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 14 had large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was 59.1+/-9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EFS for Burkitt's, lymphoblastic, and large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 66.7+/-27.2, 50.5+/-14.8, and 82.1+/-11.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In comparison with lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the relative risk for lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was higher than the others (P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EFS between anaplastic large-cell and diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 100 and 55.6+/-24.9%, respectively (P = 0.106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Status at transplantation was the most predictive factor for the survival after HDC/PBSCT (EFS for CR 70.8+/-9.5% vs non-CR 20.0+/-17.9%, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transplantation-related complications were minimal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the most prevalent complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>HDC/PBSCT is considered applicable to recurrent or refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric NHL</z:e> patients safely and it could replace conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study, children with CR status at the time of HDC/PBSCT showed higher survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, refractory or recurrent lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients showed dismal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, new therapeutic modalities may be needed for this group of NHL patients </plain></SENT>
