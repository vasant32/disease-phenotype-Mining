<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously established a B-cell line (MBC-1) from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at the leukaemic stage which demonstrated the typical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when treated with anti-IgM antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FK506, an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> and calcineurin inhibitor, partially rescued the anti-IgM antibody-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these MBC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE nuclease activity assay demonstrated that a 17 kD protein exhibited endonuclease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active gel assay showed nuclease activity in the cellular nuclear extract not treated with anti-IgM antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This nuclease activity was inhibited by FK506 at concentrations of 10-200 ng/ml in the active gel assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results raise the possibility that the 17 kD endonuclease is one of the nuclear members of the immunophilin family, which may function as an endogenous endonuclease in MBC-1 cells </plain></SENT>
