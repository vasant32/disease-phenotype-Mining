<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Because more than 70% of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> become long-term survivors, more emphasis is put on reducing late effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryopreservation of semen and the intracytoplasmic sperm injection technique makes it possible to obtain pregnancy with very poor sperm quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two new semen retrieval methods are described that are applicable in pubertal boys with a fertility potential, although not psychologically ready to produce a semen sample, who are likely to become <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> because of anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two pubertal boys (aged 14 and 15 years) had a late testicular relapse of pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e>, stage II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patient 1, penile vibratory stimulation (PVS) was tried under general anesthesia without success and electroejaculation (EEJ) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before alkylating chemotherapy and testicular irradiation, PVS was performed with success in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An antegrade ejaculate of 0.7 ml with 1% motile spermatozoa and an retrograde ejaculate with 1.6 x 10(6)/ml spermatozoa (5% with fair motility) was obtained from patient 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An antegrade ejaculate of 1.5 ml with 2.5 x 10(6)/ml spermatozoa (29% with fair motility) was obtained from patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVS should be the first choice of treatment because it is noninvasive, simple, and easily applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because EEJ requires general anesthesia, it should be used as a second option </plain></SENT>
