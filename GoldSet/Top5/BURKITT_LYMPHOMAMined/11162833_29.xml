<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-10 can modulate the immune response at certain levels, playing a crucial role in balancing humoral and cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it can function as a growth and differentiation factor for B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of IL-10 induction is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that IL-10 was specifically induced by the EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines BL2 and BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two T cell lines (Jurkat, MOLT3), two NHL cell lines (U266, MHH-PREB1), or three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) cell lines (L428, L540, and KMH2), LMP1 did not induce IL-10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LMP1 activated CD40 or CD54 (ICAM1) expression in the analyzed cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMP1 derivatives lacking the C-terminal activation regions (CTAR), by deletion of the amino acids between 187 and 351 (Delta CTAR1) or 232 and 386 (Delta CTAR2), alone, or together induced IL-10 at very low amounts compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of LMP1-mediated NF kappa B activation by constitutive repressive I kappa B-alpha only marginally impaired IL-10 expression in BL2 cells, while SB2035080 at 5 microM (a specific p38/SAPK2 inhibitor) led to reduced IL-10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings confirm the role of LMP1 in transactivation of cellular genes possibly important for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunoescape but show that more than one signaling pathway is involved in this activation and suggests the necessity of a defined conformation of CTARs to activate IL-10 involving p38/SAPK2 </plain></SENT>
