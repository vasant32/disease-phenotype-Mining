<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in ten human cell lines (nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) was studied using reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using P53U and P53D primers for amplifying a 371-base pair (bp) target fragment spanning exons 7-10 of p53 cDNA, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized PCR products were amplified from 9 cell lines but not from the Hep3B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional larger band (504 bp) was observed for the Molt-4 T-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Employing P531 and P53D primers which flank a 76-bp p53 cDNA fragment, 76 bp as well as 209 bp products were generated by PCR of Molt-4 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the 504 bp and 209 bp bands confirmed the presence of a 133 bp insertion between exons 9 and 10 in the aberrant transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This insertion was homologous to a 130-bp sequence within the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 intron 9, except for 2 point mutations and 3 base insertions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of P53U/P53D PCR products of Molt-4 genomic DNA revealed an 8 bp deletion just downstream to the 133 bp insertion, creating a novel donor splicing site within intron 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This site, coupled with an inherent acceptor splicing site just upstream to the 133 bp insertion, suggests that the 133 bp stretch represents an alternative exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of a termination signal within this alternative transcript is predicted to culminate in a truncated p53 translational product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequences of the 371 bp PCR products of Molt-4, HT-1080, SiHa, CaSki, HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines corresponded with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>G--&gt;T transversions at the third base of codon 249 of p53 were detected in Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/5 <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> lines, while a <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> to CAC mutation at codon 234 was observed in an allele of the Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
