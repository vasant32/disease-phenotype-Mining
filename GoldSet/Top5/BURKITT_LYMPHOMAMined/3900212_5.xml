<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ex vivo anti-leukemic efficacy and stem cell toxicity of two different T cell directed immunotoxins containing pokeweed antiviral protein (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) were studied by clonal assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>5E9-11-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>, an immunotoxin directed against human transferrin receptors, elicited a maximum leukemic cell kill of 3.9 logs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it was also toxic against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pluripotent stem cells, and therefore is not a clinically useful purgative reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> conjugated to 3-A1, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD7 (T, p41), was more effective against leukemic T cells than 5E9-11-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> and eliminated a maximum of 4.8 log of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3A1-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> was only slightly toxic to pluripotent stem cells: 13% of CFU-GEMM were lost after treatment with 3000 ng of 3A1-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>/ml, a concentration that eliminated 99.96% of contaminating leukemic T cells from a 200-fold excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cryopreservation of treated cells by conventional methods did not affect the extreme selectivity and potency of 3A1-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of 3A1-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> with peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in the complete inhibition of phytohemagglutinin-induced mitogenic response, illustrating the possibility of using this immunotoxin as a potent anti-T cell reagent for prophylaxis against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs host disease</z:e> in allogeneic BMT as well </plain></SENT>
