<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indirect membrane immunofluorescence showed that the absorbed serum, which had lost the capacity to bind P3HR-1 cells, nevertheless gave bright staining on a small proportion of B95-8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoretic analysis of 125I-labelled MA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> showed that the absorbed serum was able to isolate MA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> from both B95-7 and QIMR-WIL cells, but not from P3HR-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that there is substantial sharing of antigenic specificities between the MA determined by three isolates of EB virus, and some antigenic divergence </plain></SENT>
