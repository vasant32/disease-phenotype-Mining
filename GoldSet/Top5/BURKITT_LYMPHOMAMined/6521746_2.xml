<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was not due to the contribution of antibodies because hypogammaglobulinemic serum also augmented cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the mechanism of the enhancement was due to activation of C3 by the Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assume that the cleavage products are deposited on cell surfaces in such a way that they contribute to contact between effector and target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous reports in two antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity systems provided other examples for the existence of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
