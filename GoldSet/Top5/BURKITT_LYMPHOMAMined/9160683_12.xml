<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the high-risk features predictive of poor treatment outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, such as older age, high white blood cell (WBC) count, organomegaly, T-lineage immunophenotype, ability of leukemic cells to cause overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice, presence of MLL-AF4, and BCR-ABL fusion transcripts were associated with high levels of BCL-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, high BCL-2 levels were not associated with slow early response, failure to achieve complete remission, or poor event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High BCL-2 levels in primary leukemic cells predicted slow early response only in T-lineage ALL patients, which comprised approximately 15% of the total patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even for this small subset of patients, the level of BCL-2 expression did not have a significant impact on the short-term event-free survival </plain></SENT>
