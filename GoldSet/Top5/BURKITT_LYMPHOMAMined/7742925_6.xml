<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to be associated with numerous human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279748" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, some typical <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinomas</z:mp> were also recently reported to demonstrate EBV relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to detect EBV in primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, using the in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) method, in which oligonucleotide probes for the EBER1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and the EBV DNA W region have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 49 cases of primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> studied, which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed B cell immunophenotype, EBER1 sequences could only be found in four cases, including two low-grade cases and two high-grade cases of histological subtypes while the number of positive cells was less than 50% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case of low-grade mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the EBER1-positive neoplastic cells were found in the regional lymph node, but the primary site of the stomach showed no positive signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBV presence was further confirmed by the EBV DNA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> method, rare or occasional positive lymphoid cells (probably non-tumorous bystander cells) could be detected in 10 other cases including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that only a small proportion of primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is associated with EBV, and such positive cases could be found in both high- and low-grade histological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is also suggested that the EBV presence in the neoplastic cells of some cases of primary gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is most likely a secondary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
