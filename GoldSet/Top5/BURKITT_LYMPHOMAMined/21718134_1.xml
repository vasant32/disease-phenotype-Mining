<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims in this study were to establish prognostic factors for overall survival in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and evaluate the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens in a population based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population was collected from the Swedish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Registry 2000-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this period, 156 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, age and performance status (PS) were significant adverse prognostic factors for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified prognostic index, based on: age &gt;40 years, PS &gt;1, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase &gt; upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (ULN) was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a score of 0-1, 2, and 3 were found to have a 2-year survival of 91.2%, 58.4%, and 27.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-intensity regimens were associated with more favorable overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab addition was not significantly associated with improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A modified prognostic index may be valuable for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, as proposed </plain></SENT>
