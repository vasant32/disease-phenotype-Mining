<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the biochemical pathways controlling this differential response, we have studied the intracellular localization of cyclin B1 in cell types sensitive or resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that cyclin B1 protein accumulates in the nucleus of cells that are sensitive to gamma radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (thymocytes, lymphoid cell lines), but remains cytoplasmic in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant cells (primary and transformed fibroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of both cell types with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52646">leptomycin B</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent cyclin B1 nuclear export, induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ectopic expression of cyclin B1-5xE, a protein that preferentially localizes to the nucleus, is sufficient to trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, expression of cyclin B1-5xA, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, fails to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nuclear accumulation is necessary for cyclin B1-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations are consistent with the idea that localization of cyclin B1 is among the factors determining the cellular decision to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
