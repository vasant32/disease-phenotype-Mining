<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been successfully employed in the clinical treatment of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in both unmodified and radio-labeled forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous publications have demonstrated that the antitumor effects of unmodified anti-CD20 mAb are mediated by several mechanisms including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-mediated cell lysis, and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD20 cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by three anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies [1F5, anti-B1, and C2B8 (Rituximab)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction was greater with the chimeric Rituximab antibody than with the murine 1F5 and anti-B1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> could be enhanced with any of the antibodies by cross-linking with secondary antibodies (or Fc-receptor-bearing accessory cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signaling events involved in anti-CD20-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were investigated, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, increases in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentrations, caspase activation, and cleavage of caspase substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that anti-CD20-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> can be attenuated by PP1, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> of extracellular or intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, and inhibitors of caspases, suggesting that anti-CD20-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may involve modulation of these signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that varying the expression of Bc1-2 did not affect the magnitude of anti-B1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, possibly because of the sequestering effects of other Bc1-2 family members, such as Bad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies identify several of the signal-transduction events involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of malignant B cells that transpire following ligation of CD20 by anti-CD20 antibodies in the presence of Fc-receptor-expressing cells or secondary goat anti-(mouse Ig) antibodies and which may contribute to the <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regressions</z:mp> observed in mouse models and clinical trials </plain></SENT>
