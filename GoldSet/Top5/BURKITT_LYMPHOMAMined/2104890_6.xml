<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines JBL2 and Ly91 contain intracytoplasmic mu chains without L chain by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mu chains and the corresponding cDNA are abnormally short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of the productive H chain alleles showed that the cell lines JBL2 and Ly91 use a VHIV and a VHIII subgroup gene, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cell lines, the 3' part of the V exon was markedly abnormal and contained several stop codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Point mutations affected the JH6 donor splice site in the JBL2 gene, precluding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splicing into C mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the JH2 splice site was unmodified in Ly91, it was not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As in JBL2, splicing occurred at an alternate splice site present 5' of these alterations, thus removing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these abnormalities from the mature transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This alternate splicing explains the presence in both cell lines of truncated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and proteins lacking two-thirds of the V region </plain></SENT>
