<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of BAFF (B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family) and its receptors has been identified in numerous B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A soluble human BAFF mutant (mBAFF), binding to BAFF receptors but failing to activate B-lymphocyte proliferation, may function as a competitive inhibitor of BAFF and may serve as a novel ligand for targeted therapy of BAFF receptor-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pin2/TRF1-interacting protein X1 (PinX1), a nucleolar protein, potently inhibits telomerase activity and affects tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generated novel recombinant proteins containing mBAFF, a polyarginine tract 9R and PinX1 (or its C/N terminal), to target <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fusion proteins PinX1/C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF and PinX1/C-9R-mBAFF specifically bind and internalize into BAFF receptor-positive cells, and subsequently induce growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The selective cytotoxicity of the fusion proteins is a BAFF receptor-mediated process and depends on mBAFF, PinX1/C and 9R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the fusion proteins specifically kill BAFF receptor-expressing Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells by inhibiting telomerase activity and the consequent shortening of telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic experiments using PinX1C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF in severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice implanted with Raji cells showed significantly prolonged survival times, indicating the in vivo antitumor activity of the fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the potential of PinX1/C-G(4)S-9R-G(4)S-mBAFF in targeted therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
