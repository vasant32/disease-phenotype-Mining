<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of myc, which is believed to be involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in other cell systems, declined as thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, if administered when nbl expression was enhanced, but not before or after the peak of nbl expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nbl expression is associated with thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
