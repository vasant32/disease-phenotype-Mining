<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 4-year-old boy with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (small non-cleaved cell NHL) who presented with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, resulting from encasement of the common bile duct by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent near-total excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and biliary-enteric bypass to relieve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined chemotherapy was not given because of refusal by his family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the operation, obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> reappeared due to a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumor</z:e> compressing the liver hilum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He received chemotherapy and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> disappeared within 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up computed tomography 1 year later revealed total resolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three conclusions are suggested by this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First, although NHL presenting as obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> is uncommon in children, it should be included in the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, relief of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> can be effectively accomplished by chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Third, chemotherapy should be given once NHL is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
