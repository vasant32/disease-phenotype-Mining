<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various aspects of the interferon (IFN) system were studied in malignant cells from 37 unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that leukemic cells from two of 37 patients had a complete loss of alpha- and beta-IFN genes, whereas cells from four of 37 had lost one of the alpha-/beta-IFN alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 25 cases, viable cells were also available for functional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell clones with loss of one of the alpha-/beta-IFN alleles produced low amounts of IFN after virus induction in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some clones with an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> set of IFN genes were unable to produce detectable amounts of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clones studied were found to carry high-affinity alpha-IFN receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In clones carrying deletions of IFN genes, the cells were sensitive to IFN in vitro as measured by alpha-IFN-induced enhancement of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-A synthetase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells from four patients with an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> set of IFN genes were insensitive to this effect of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that of the 17 patients in which IFN genes, IFN production, alpha-IFN receptors, and IFN-induced enhancement of 2',5'-A synthetase were studied, nine (53%) showed some abnormality in their IFN system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding may add some support to the hypothesis that defects in the IFN system could be a step on the path to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients whose malignant cells carry IFN gene deletions or other defects in their IFN-producing capacity, but are still sensitive to exogenous IFN, could represent a subgroup of ALL with a greater likelihood of responding to IFN therapy </plain></SENT>
