<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study aimed to compare the results of CHOP with those from two protocols (PETHEMA-LAL3/97 and BURKIMAB) of specific therapy in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from Group A (n=31) received 6 standard CHOP cycles every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients from group B (n=44) received six multiagent cycles including high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response to therapy, disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) were compared in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups were comparable for the main clinical and biological parameters at diagnosis except for risk activity, previous HAART, bone marrow involvement, bulky disease and extranodal involved sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 10 out of 31 (32%) patients in group A and 28 out of 44 (67%) patients in group B (P=.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median (range) follow-up of 70 (26-139) and 17 (1-134) months, the 5-year (95% CI) DFS probability was 87% (64%-100%) for group A and 70% (51%-89%) for group B (P=.374), and the 5-year (95% CI) OS was 27% (10%-43%) for Group A and 57% (40%-74%) for group B (P=.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses showed that specific therapy was associated with an improved CR and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> short intensive specific chemotherapy is feasible, with higher remission rate and improved survival than that obtained with CHOP-based regimens </plain></SENT>
