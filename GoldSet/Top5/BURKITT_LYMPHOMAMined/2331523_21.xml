<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concomitant rearrangements of Ig and TcR genes have been commonly reported in the most immature lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, mainly in B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better characterize the nature of this lineage promiscuity, we have analyzed the configuration of the TcR delta locus in 75 B-precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The large majority of cases (87%) displayed a rearrangement or deletion at the delta locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 57 nondeletional rearrangements, two patterns were predominant and both appeared to derive from partial joining: a V delta-(D)-D delta 3 (32/57) and a D delta 1/2-D delta 3 (11/57) type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single V delta gene (V delta 2) appeared to be involved in the first type of rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are at variance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, where rearrangements 5' to V delta 2 are usually found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It remains to be elucidated whether this incomplete attempt of V delta 2 gene assembly is related to the neoplastic event or represents a physiologic predisposition occurring during early stages of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
