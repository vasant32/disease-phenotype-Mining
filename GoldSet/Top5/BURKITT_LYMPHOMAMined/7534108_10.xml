<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified deletions of 9p and 9q in a cytogenetic analysis of a large series of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs), which suggested loss of candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes (TSGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to define these deletions at the molecular level, we performed an LOH analysis of a panel of paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNAs comprising 13 cases of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with a large cell component (DLLC) and 18 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The loci tested comprised eight polymorphic probes mapped to 9p (D9S33, D9S25, IFNB, IFNA, IFNW, D9S126, D9S3, and D9S19) and seven polymorphic probes mapped to 9q (D9S29, ASS, AKI, ABL, D9S10, D9S7, and D9S14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, among cases informative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci in each subset, 5/13 (38%) DLLC and 4/18 (22%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> showed LOH at 9p loci, whereas 5/13 (38%) DLLC and 3/18 (16%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> showed LOH at 9q loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 9p loci partial homozygous or heterozygous losses were observed in 20-50% of informative cases of DLLC at D9S25, IFNB, IFNA, IFNW, D9S126, and D9S3, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, losses at these loci ranged from 0% to 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 9q loci, heterozygous losses were observed in &gt; 20% of informative cases of DLLC at D9S7 (23%) and D9S29 (27%), whereas no losses were seen at these two loci in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate a high level of molecular deletion in DLLC, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, suggesting that loss of one or more TSGs on chromosome 9 plays an important role in DLLC development </plain></SENT>
