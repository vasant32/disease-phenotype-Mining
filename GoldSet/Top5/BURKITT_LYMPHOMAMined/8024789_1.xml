<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a rapid and inexpensive method for identifying specific cDNAs that involves hybridization of cDNAs to specific oligonucleotides bound to nylon filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we have identified specific cDNAs for a human B-cell growth factor from different cDNA libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total processing time was 3 days, and 30% of the cDNAs selected by this method were correct </plain></SENT>
