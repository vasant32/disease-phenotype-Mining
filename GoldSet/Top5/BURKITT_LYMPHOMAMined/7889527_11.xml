<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response to treatment as well as recent evidence for its important function as a regulating mechanism in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> has also been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the most prominent biological features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is nucleosomal DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this communication, we present a study of DNA fragmentation in Raji cells which have been subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> treatment to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the induction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of fragmentation is swift, and consistent with previous reports that fragmentation must be a rapid event </plain></SENT>
