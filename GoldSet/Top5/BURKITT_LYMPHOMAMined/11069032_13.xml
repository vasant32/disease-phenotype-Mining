<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe five cases of this entity which appears to have very homogeneous clinical, phenotypic and genotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had prior history of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical features with nodal and/or extranodal disease, massive bone marrow infiltration and rapid increase of circulating blast cells of mature B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three patients had evidence of BCL-6 involvement and one patient had a p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
