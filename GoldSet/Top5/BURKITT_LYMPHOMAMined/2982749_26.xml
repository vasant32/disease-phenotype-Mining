<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) is the only known virally-determined component that is regularly associated with EBV-transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A main component of EBNA, herein designated EBNA-1, has been conclusively localized to the BamHI K fragment of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 is present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-carrying cell lines so far studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our current study deals with a second component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that the EBNA reaction detected by anti-complement immunofluorescence (ACIF) in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines Daudi, Jijoye, and P3HR-1 could be completely removed by preabsorption of sera with any one of these 3 lines, when tested against any other of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same absorbed sera still gave a brilliant nuclear staining against other EBV-carrying lines, e.g. Raji or B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3 lines in the first category carry EBV genomes that have deletions in the BamHI WYH region of the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This region is intact in the second group of lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result is interpreted as showing the existence of 2 different ACIF-stainable EBV-determined nuclear antigens, one of which is associated with the BamHI WYH region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We designate this antigen as EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that the two different EBNAs are different with regard to their association with metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In lines positive for both EBNA subtypes, metaphase chromosomes gave brilliant EBNA-1 staining, but could not be stained for EBNA-2, indicating differences in chromatin association of the two EBNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An 86 kd <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was identified by immunoblotting of DNA-binding proteins from EBV-transformed lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EBV-specificity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was demonstrated by the presence of antibodies against this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in antisera from a population of EBV-seropositive donors, but not from seronegative donors, by the presence of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> itself in EBV-carrying but not in EBV-negative cell lines and by the appearance of antibodies against this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> during the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was absent from the EBV-carrying P3HR-1, Daudi and Jijoye cell lines, which suggested that it may be encoded by the BamHI WYH region that is deleted from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> substrains carried by these lines </plain></SENT>
