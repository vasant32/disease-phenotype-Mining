<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also observed that 4-HPR elicited a reduced expression of bcl-6 in these cells, which supports the proposed role of bcl-6 as an anti-apoptotic gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While 4-HPR treatment had no effect on total Rb gene expression, it significantly reduced the state of hyperphosphorylation of Rb, resulting in the predominant existence of Rb in the underphosphorylated state </plain></SENT>
