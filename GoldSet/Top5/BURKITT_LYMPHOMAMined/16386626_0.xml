<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative syndromes (PTLS) are considered to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus, and 86% are of the B-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathology ranges from polymorphic-reactive to monomorphic forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clonality should be studied using molecular biology techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically, a differentiation is usually made between early PTLS (occurring within 1 year after transplantation) and late PTLS, which occur as localized or disseminated nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In localized forms, immunosuppression should be discontinued or decreased, and the involved area should be subsequently resected or irradiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In disseminated cases, immunosuppression should be decreased and administration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If this is not effective, treatment should be started with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If no response occurs, use of chemotherapy, possibly with interferon, should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to report the incidence, clinical signs, and treatment in a series of patients undergoing lung transplantation (LTx) </plain></SENT>
