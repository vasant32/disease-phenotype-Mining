<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent phenotypic analysis of plasma cells showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells do express the B-cell lineage-specific molecule CD19, but their malignant counterpart (<z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells) are CD19- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the meaning of loss of CD19 antigen on <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells, we first compared the expression of CD19 and Pax-5 genes among B cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, and primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells, because the Pax-5 gene was reported to encode the transcriptional factor, B-cell-specific activating protein (BSAP), necessary for CD19 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither CD19 nor Pax-5 mRNA could be detected in those primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells and cell lines, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells did express both CD19 and Pax-5 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we could confirm that BSAP-binding activity was not detected in the nuclear extract from CD19- <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line (KMS-5) but was detected in CD19+ B-cell line (Raji) by gel-shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further examined the expression of E2A and Id genes, because E2A and Id are considered to be positive and negative regulators in the expression of Pax-5 gene, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences in the expression of these E2A and Id-2 genes could be observed between <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these data suggest that the altered expression of Pax-5, but not E2A or Id, is responsible for the loss of CD19 expression in human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells, although the underlying mechanism of the altered Pax-5 gene expression remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
