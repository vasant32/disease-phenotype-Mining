<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cells of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line Raji were incubated with 1.0 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DEX) for 2, 4 and 8 h respectively, then stained with Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> conjugated) which was used to detect the exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) on the epimembrane resulting from a loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> asymmetry in the early stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and also stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) which allows analysis of secondary necrotic cells related with cell membrane and DNA damage that probably representlate stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, then apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Annexin+ /PI- and Annexin+ /PI+ cells were sorted by fluoresence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and identified by electron microscopy (EM) and DNA gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of apoptotic cells was found to increase with the incubation time (r = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method was sensitive with low detection limit (0.02%), and was reproducible with low coefficient variance (CV) (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the Annexin+ /PI- and Annexin+ /PI+ cells were identified as apoptotic and necrotic cells under EM, and DNA extracted from the Annexin+ /PI- cells was characterized by "ladder pattern" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Annexin-V assay is a specific, sensitive, accurate, reproductive and quantitative method for analyzing apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
