<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report high titers of IgG antibodies directed against O-acetylated derivatives of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> (O-AcSA) in serum of ALL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antibodies were purified using bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and the IgG distribution was confined to IgG(1)and IgG(2)subclasses; their binding was totally abolished with de-O-acetylation confirming their specificity towards O-AcSA determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry demonstrated binding of these antibody fractions to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both T- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients having increased cell surface 9-O-AcSA determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting of membranes derived from PBMC of ALL patients confirmed binding of the antibody to O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates corresponding to 144, 135, 120, 90, and 36 kDa whereas binding to PBMC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals corresponded to 144 and 36 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specificity of the antibody fraction towards 9-O-AcSA was substantiated by hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antibody purified from ALL serum selectively mediates complement dependent cytolysis of lymphoblasts expressing O-AcSAs and thereby possibly confers passive protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enhanced anti O-AcSA antibody levels allowed for development of a serodiagnostic assay (BSM-ELISA) specific for ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minimal crossreactivity was observed with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 16), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 7) and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3) as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy individuals (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BSM-ELISA therefore provides a simple, noninvasive alternative diagnostic approach for ALL and merits clinical consideration </plain></SENT>
