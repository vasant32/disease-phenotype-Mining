<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have analysed the clinical features, EBV association, subtype and prevalence of the deleted variant of the Latent Membrane Protein-1 (LMP-1) of EBV in forty-two cases from two developing countries- India (n = 25) and Argentina (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both countries the abdomen was the site most commonly involved while jaw involvement was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV was detected by in-situ hybridization using the EBER-1 RNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>47% of cases from Argentina and 80% of cases from India were EBER positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV typing using EBNA-3C primers showed a predominance of Type A in both countries (India-13/16 and Argentina-(7/8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30bp deletion of the LMP-1 gene was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluated cases from Argentina while the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> of the gene was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the evaluable Indian cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights the similarities and differences in the clinical presentation and EBV association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in two developing countries and also indicates that the subtype of EBV and prevalence of the LMP-1 deletion may reflect the predominant subtype in a particular population </plain></SENT>
