<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted structure analysis indicated (+)-discodermolide, a polyhydroxylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37835">alkatetraene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> marine natural product, was an antimitotic compound, and we confirmed this prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous work had shown an accumulation of discodermolide-treated cells in the G2/M portion of the cell cycle, and we have now found that discodermolide arrests Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Discodermolide-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> cells displayed spectacular rearrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton, including extensive microtubule bundling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microtubule rearrangement that occurred with 10 nM discodermolide required 1 microM <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discodermolide had equally impressive effects on tubulin assembly in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Near-total polymerization occurred at 0 degree C with tubulin plus microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) under conditions in which <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> at an identical concentration was inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without MAPs and/or without <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>, tubulin assembly was also more vigorous with discodermolide than with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> under every reaction condition examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discodermolide-induced polymer differed from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>-induced polymer in that it was completely stable at 0 degree C in the presence of high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a quantitative assay designed to select for agents more effective than <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> in inducing assembly, discodermolide had an EC50 value of 3.2 microM versus 23 microM for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
