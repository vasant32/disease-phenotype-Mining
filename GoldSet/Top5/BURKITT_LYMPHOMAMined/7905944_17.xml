<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many different methods have been used to evaluate mdr1 expression in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper compares four methods for determination of mdr1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the mdr1 gene expression in 36 freshly established cell lines from 28 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (16 T-ALL, six BCP-ALL, two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (L3), two biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukemic specimens were obtained at the time of diagnosis in 16 cases, and after chemotherapy in 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples, mdr1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was measured by slot blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR), and the presence of the mdr1 product, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, was detected by immunohistochemistry with the MRK-16 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In situ mdr1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization was performed in 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete agreement was noted between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the techniques in 14 cases (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results differed on a single test result in another 39% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 78% of cases were considered assessable, and the consensus result was presumed to be correct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By this consensus criterion, immunohistochemistry yields both false negative (11%), and false positive (11%) results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> slot blotting has a high (21%) false positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In situ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> hybridization and rt-PCR have the highest concordance, 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 28 patients from whom these cell lines were derived appear to represent a very poor prognosis group, since there are only two patients (with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) who are long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, a complete clinical response to therapy was correlated with absence of mdr1 expression in assessable cases (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These four methods of determining mdr1 expression often yield discordant results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of at least two methods for evaluating mdr1 expression is advisable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Rt-PCR is recommended because of its relative simplicity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This should be supplemented by a technique (immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry) able to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression among cells </plain></SENT>
