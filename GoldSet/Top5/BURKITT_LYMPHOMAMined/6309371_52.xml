<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Kinetics of cell growth of human B-lymphocyte lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and lines derived from the Epstein-Barr virus transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult lymphocytes were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells seeded at high densities (5 X 10(4)/ml) grew in an exponential manner; those seeded at low densities (5 X 10(3) to 1 X 10(4) began to grow exponentially only after a lag period of 3 to 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfer of stationary low-density cell populations into filtered media from growing high-density cultures (conditioned media) stimulated cell growth, as determined both by <z:mp ids='MP_0000318'>increased cell numbers</z:mp> and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhanced cell growth occurred in conditioned media at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell seeding concentrations that grew in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cultures seeded at very low cell concentrations that do not grow in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> media proliferated in conditioned media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Media from a series of B-cell lines tested with one exception were autostimulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal cell transfer experiments showed that media from B-cell lines cross-stimulated cells in other B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Media from the non-B-cell lines tested were not autostimulatory and did not stimulate growth of the B-cell lines, and conversely these non-B-cell lines were not growth enhanced by the conditioned media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Absorption of growth-enhancing media with preincubated cell lines seeded at low density removed the enhancing capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that B-cell lines from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and B-cells transformed in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus produce absorbable growth-enhancing factor(s) that may be essential to the development of perpetual growth in culture </plain></SENT>
