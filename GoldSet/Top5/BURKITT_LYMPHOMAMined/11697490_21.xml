<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure to certain pesticides and organochlorines has been shown to be risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that has been associated with some subgroups of NHL, such as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> related to severe immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> adjusted blood concentrations of 36 congeners of polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16598">p,p'-DDE</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5692">hexachlorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="5692">HCB</z:chebi>), four different subgroups of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="34623">chlordanes</z:chebi> (trans-nonachlordane, cis-nonachlordane, MC6 and oxychlordane) and 2,2',4,4'-tetrabrominated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39258">diphenyl ether</z:chebi> (TBDE) in incident cases of NHL and controls from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Titers of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr early antigen (EA) were correlated to concentrations of organochlorines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significant difference in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> adjusted blood concentrations of total PCBs and TBDE between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Titers of antibodies to EA IgG &gt; 80 were correlated to an increased risk for NHL with odds ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.94-3.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This risk was further increased in those with a level above the median value of "sum of PCBs" (OR=4.0, CI=1.2-14), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="5692">HCB</z:chebi> (OR=5.3, CI=1.6-19), sum of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="34623">chlordanes</z:chebi> (OR=4.0, CI=1.2-14) and TBDE (OR=21, CI=4.6-124), suggesting an interaction between EBV and a higher concentration of these chemicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also for the "sum of immunotoxic PCBs" increased risk was found in that group (OR=6.4, CI=1.9-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subdivision of NHL in histological types yielded highest risks for low-grade B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
