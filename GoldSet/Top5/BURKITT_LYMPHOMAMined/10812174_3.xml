<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report heteromorphism of the centrometric region of human chromosome 7, which was observed in the cytogenetic assessment of a complete remission of a pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> in the bone marrow cells of a 25-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classical cytogenetic study was performed, as well as metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) carried out with an alphoid DNA probe specific for the chromosome 7 centromere for detection of leukemic clones with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 found at the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show an important centromeric heteromorphism of this chromosome detected by FISH and clearly visible on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases and nuclei analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This heteromorphism is observable as a fluorescent signal five- or sixfold larger than that on the homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this heteromorphism of chromosome 7 has not been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, with the use of FISH analysis, it could be easily mistaken for a mosaicism of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, which can be misleading in the interpretation of the results </plain></SENT>
