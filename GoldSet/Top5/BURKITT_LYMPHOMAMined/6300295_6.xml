<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Polyvalent serum directed against C3 receptors was employed in an attempt to block Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binding to virus receptor-containing cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum eliminated 90% of virus binding to Daudi and BJAB, lines which express only the C3d receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji and Ramos cells, which express the C3d, C3b and C3bi receptors, still adsorbed 70% of their virus capacity in the presence of excess antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects were independent of the virus strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the light of previous reports, these data imply that, although the two receptors, EBV and C3d, are closely associated, the binding sites of EBV and complement are distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an unusual EBV substrain-specific receptor found on U698 and P3HR-1/ASNP lines was shown to be independent of complement receptors </plain></SENT>
