<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BRD4 also contributes to regulation of both cell cycle and transcription of oncogenes, HIV, and human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus (HPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its role in a broad range of biological processes, the precise molecular mechanism of BRD4 function remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that BRD4 is an atypical kinase that binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II and directly phosphorylates its serine 2 (Ser2) sites both in vitro and in vivo under conditions where other CTD kinases are inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of the CTD Ser2 is inhibited in vivo by a BRD4 inhibitor that blocks its binding to chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our finding that BRD4 is an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II CTD Ser2 kinase implicates it as a regulator of eukaryotic transcription </plain></SENT>
