<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the United States, New York City has had the greatest number of subjects at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> for the longest period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This population therefore serves as an indicator of changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk which may emerge among persons at risk from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a proportional incidence method, we surveyed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occurring among single (a surrogate for homosexual) young men and married young men in Manhattan, the rest of New York City, and the remainder of New York State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline period was established earlier to be 1973-76, during which time no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> were observed among single men in Manhattan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 1985, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> in this group was increased 1,850-fold (compared with expected cases derived from other registries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the same group, the increase of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 6.2-fold (p for trend less than 0.0001), with excesses of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> being most noticeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> increased markedly in 1985 but not earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since this pattern did not follow that of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic in this area, we suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> is not an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Hepatoma</z:e> was diagnosed more frequently in single young men during the 1980s but similar increases also were observed in married men and thus may be unrelated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, only <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appear to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, at least so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With better treatment and longer survival, it remains possible that other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> will emerge as part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> epidemic </plain></SENT>
