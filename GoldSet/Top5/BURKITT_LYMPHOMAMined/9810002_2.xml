<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fusion of the highly tumorigenic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line BL60-P7 with the nontumorigenic autologous EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) IARC 277 results in suppression of the tumorigenic phenotype of the parental cell line BL60-P7 after s.c. inoculation into T cell-deficient <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed whether, after long-term cultivation of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> hybrid cells, expression of tumorigenicity could be observed and correlated to the loss of particular chromosomes or chromosomal fragments, akin to numerous nonlymphoid hybrid cell models described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two years after fusion, in vitro proliferation of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> x LCL hybrid cells accelerated, and they partially lost LCL-typical aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no major changes in the expression pattern of B cell-associated surface antigens and the EBV latent membrane protein LMP 1 were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic evaluation of these cells revealed spontaneous loss of chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping of long-term cultivated hybrid cells demonstrated the occurrence of disomy for each chromosome in at least one metaphase analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if suppression of tumorigenicity in these hybrid cells would have been the result of the presence of a single LCL-derived chromosome, there should have been a high probability of its loss, leading to tumorigenic segregants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the tumorigenic phenotype remained suppressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To induce chromosomal breakage and maldistribution, in addition to spontaneous chromosomal loss, the hybrid cell lines were irradiated at various doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Again, none of the hybrid cell clones treated in this manner became tumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analysis of the regressing hybrid cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> revealed that the hybrid cells had retained their LCL-like differentiation phenotype in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, infiltration with mononuclear cells of murine origin was observed in these regressing hybrid grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that suppression of the tumorigenic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> phenotype in these hybrid cells cannot be attributed to a function encoded by a distinct chromosome or chromosomal fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rather, the unexpected stable nontumorigenic phenotype reflects a LCL-specific activated B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of these hybrids, most probably induced by the expression of numerous copies of episomal latent EBV proteins </plain></SENT>
