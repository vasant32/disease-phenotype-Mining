<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) is a rare condition, which should be well known to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> paediatric medical facilities dealing with bone marrow and solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spectrum and the primary detecting modality of the initial imaging findings in paediatric transplant recipients with abdominal and soft-tissue PTLD should be studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 7 children/adolescents (female: 4, male: 3; age: 3 - 19 yrs.; study period: 7 yrs.) after heart (5), kidney (1) or liver (1) transplantation were evaluated regarding their initial clinical and imaging findings of PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 6 patients had a latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTLD presented with clinical symptoms in only 5 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>: 2, soft-tissue swelling: 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo>: 1) and was detected on routine abdominal ultrasound (US) controls in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>US was the primary imaging modality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children and led to suspecting PTLD in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the seventh case, US had been misinterpreted first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to US, additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) better demonstrated the extent of the disease in 3 children, but were even inferior in another 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no completely false-negative US examination during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: US is reliable for detecting as well as excluding abdominal and soft-tissue PTLD in paediatric patients after solid-organ transplantation and might even be superior to MRI/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an increased risk of developing PTLD should be closely monitored by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI/CT may be reserved for supplementary imaging in cases incomplete or equivocal on US, but are primarily essential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a localisation of PTLD not accessible by US </plain></SENT>
