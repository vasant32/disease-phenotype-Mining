<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have constructed a phage display combinatorial antibody Fab library from a patient with marginal zone B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> and carrying high serum anti-EBV-VCA IgG titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fab fragments were selected by panning against EBV-VCA protein coated onto ELISA plates, and selected Fab clones were characterized by ELISA, western blotting (WB), indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have established two Fab clones, Fab-aVCA1 and Fab-aVCA21, which specifically recognize EBV-VCA by ELISA and WB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition ELISA competition showed that both clones could significantly reduce the binding of specific anti-EBV-VCA mAb to its relevant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these two Fab clones could localize VCA protein in the EBV-positive P3HR1 and Daudi cell lines, as well as in tissue samples from patients with EBV-infected lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that our two Fab clones are novel human mAbs specific for EBV-VCA protein and may have potential benefits for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in EBV-related lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
