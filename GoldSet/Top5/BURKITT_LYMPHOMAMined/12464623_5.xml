<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ST486 cell line, derived from a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, is a model for antigen-induced clonal deletion in germinal center B-lymphocytes, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced upon cross-linking of surface IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this cell line is highly sensitive to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by many chemicals, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">sodium arsenite</z:chebi>, a significant environmental contaminant with immunotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to arsenite and other chemicals, surface IgM cross-linking induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in ST486 cells with delayed kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the initial signaling events following IgM stimulation are associated with cell survival and proliferation and include activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the question of whether IgM-mediated activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways can influence the apoptotic response of ST486 cells following exposure to arsenite and selected drugs with different molecular targets, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi>, and a physical stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that IgM-stimulated cells are significantly protected against arsenite and drug-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during a window of several hours after surface IgM cross-linking, as evidenced by an inhibition of cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase and lack of morphological changes indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, surface IgM cross-linking also protects against arsenite-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> depolarization as well as caspase-9 cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that this IgM-mediated protection requires the activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways, because inhibition of either pathway blocks the ability of antigen receptor activation to protect against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study also provides evidence for p90(S6) ribosomal kinase as a point of convergence between the two signaling pathways resulting in the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad at serine 112 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This investigation demonstrates, for the first time, that specific signals transduced by activation of the B-cell receptor protect cells at a common point of regulation in the apoptotic pathways for diverse stresses </plain></SENT>
