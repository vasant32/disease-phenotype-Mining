<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that overexpression of TPPII correlates with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, centrosomal and mitotic spindle abnormalities and resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by spindle poisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TPPII knockdown by RNAi was associated with endoreplication and the accumulation of polynucleated cells that failed to complete cell division, indicating a role of TPPII in the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have applied a global approach of gene expression analysis to gain insights on the mechanism by which TPPII regulates this phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> profiling of control and TPPII knockdown <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells identified one hundred and eighty five differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional categorization of these genes highlighted major physiological functions such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton remodeling, proteolysis, and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathways and protein interactome analysis revealed a significant enrichment in components of MAP kinases signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that TPPII influences a wide network of signaling pathways that are regulated by MAPKs and exerts thereby a pleiotropic effect on biological processes associated with cell survival, proliferation and genomic instability </plain></SENT>
