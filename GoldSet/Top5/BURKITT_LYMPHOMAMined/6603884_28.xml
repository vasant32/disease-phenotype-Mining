<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic populations from 25 cases of B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (B-LL) were investigated in an attempt to define the stages of maturation arrest represented in this disease and the relationship, if any, to various clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic to this study was the expression of a number of B-cell antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included antibodies to B1 and B2, both expressed exclusively on B lymphocytes, but with the latter probably restricted to a narrow window of differentiation, BB-1 and LB-1, both markers of activated lymphocytes, and 38.13, a monoclonal antibody raised against and recognizing an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> expressed on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the patterns of reactivities were complex, the cases could be classified into various groups on the basis of the phenotypes revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were termed "pre-B," "early-B," "intermediate-B," "mature-B," and "secretory-B" from their patterns of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype expression and their capacity to secrete Ig in short-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although B1 was detected on neoplastic cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case, its intensity of expression varied markedly, being strongest on the "mature-B" and "secretory-B" cases and weakest on the "pre-B" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of B2 was essentially restricted to the "intermediate-B," "mature-B," and "secretory-B" cases and was usually, but not invariably, accompanied by the coexpression of surface IgM and IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While expression of BB-1 was restricted to a few cases with mature features, LB-1 was more frequently detected and found predominantly on "intermediate-B" and "mature-B" cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 38.13 antibody was found to react weakly with a number of the populations coexpressing IgM and IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The export of large amounts of whole Ig was restricted to three "secretory-B" cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were associated with a serum M-component corresponding to the Ig isotype secreted in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the secretion of free Ig light chains was a consistent feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-LL, and the amounts detected did not vary considerably between the different types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlation between immunologic cell-type and the stage of the disease was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Classification of the cases into "true" B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> similarly revealed no strict association of these histopathologic entities with any particular phenotypic group, although those cases with the more mature features tended to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings are discussed within the context of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell differentiation pathways </plain></SENT>
