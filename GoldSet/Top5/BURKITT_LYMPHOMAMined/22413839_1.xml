<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the feasibility and appropriateness of enrolling controls for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) from local health facilities in two regions in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> case data were compiled from two local hospitals with capacity to diagnose and treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in North-west and North-central regions of Uganda during 1997 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Local health facility data were compiled from children attending four representative local health facilities in the two regions over a two week period in May/June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age and sex patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases and children at local facilities were compared and contrasted using frequency tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 999 BL cases diagnosed in the study area (92% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases treated at the hospitals): 64% were from North-central and 36% from North-west region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases was 7.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Boys were younger than girls (6.6 years versus 7.2 years, P = 0.004) and cases from North-central region were younger than cases from North-west region (6.8 years versus 7.3 years, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 1012 children recorded at the four local health facilities: 91% at facilities in North-central region and 9% from facilities in North-west region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daily attendance varied between 1 to 75 children per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age of children at health facilities was 2.2 years (SD 2.8); it did not differ by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children at North-central region facilities were younger than children at North-west region facilities (1.8 years versus 6.6 years, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While many children attend local health facilities, confirming feasibility of obtaining controls, their mean age is much lower than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Health facilities may be suitable for obtaining young, but not older, controls </plain></SENT>
