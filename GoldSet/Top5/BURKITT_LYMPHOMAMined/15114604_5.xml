<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocation (9;22) was seen in 1/35 (2.8%) and t(1;19) in 2/35 (5.7%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the children showed t(12;21) and t(4;11) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In young adults, t(9;22) and t(1;19) were seen in 5/34 (14.7%) and 2/34 (5.8%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the latter showed t(12;21) or t(4;11) translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, there appears to be a significant under representation of the fusion transcripts for <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, a good prognostic marker, in this study, unlike in the West, where it is seen in 35% of children with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This, together with the generally increased leukemic burden seen in Indian patients, may explain in part, the poor treatment outcome reported </plain></SENT>
