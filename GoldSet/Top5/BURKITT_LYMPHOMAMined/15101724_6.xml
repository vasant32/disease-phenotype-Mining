<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least one of them, the p53-dependent pathway is commonly compromised in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in the integrity of this pathway in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines have made them useful experimental models in understanding response to standard or novel antitumor drugs vis-a-vis the p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-p53-dependent loss of apoptotic regulation also contributes to the genesis and/or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and it is possible that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines also represent these models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the expression of multiple apoptotic proteins in a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and describe cell lines with loss of cIAP1, cIAP2, Bax, Bak, Bcl-Xs and p38 MAP-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This data should make this panel of cell lines a useful screening system for testing novel apoptotic inducers </plain></SENT>
