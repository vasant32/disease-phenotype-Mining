<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrovirus designated RPMI 8226V, isolated in 1973 from the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line RPMI 8226 has been characterized by competition radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the major <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> structural protein and by nucleic acid hybridization analysis using cDNA of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus is highly related to the squirrel monkey type D retrovirus, SMRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the homologous RIA using rabbit anti-RPMI 8226V and 125I-labelled p37 of RPMI 8226V, RPMI 8226V and SMRV exhibited competition of 81% and 73% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the homologous system for SMRV p36, these viruses competed 98 and 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reagents made from the type D retrovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mason Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV), known to be related but distinct from SMRV, were used in assays designed to detect interspecies determinants of type D retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In assays using goat anti-MPMVp26 vs SMRV 125I-p36, RPMI 8226V, SMRV and MPMV competed to the same extent (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hybridization analysis of RPMI 8226V cDNA showed significant homology to cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA of mink, bat, and human cell infected with RPMI 8226V and to DNA or SMRV infected cells but not to uninfected cells or cells infected with other viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results taken together clearly indicate that RPMI 8226V and SMRV are very closely related to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding of a type D retrovirus in this human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line that had been used in EBV studies (the usual source of EBV being the marmoset cell line B95-8) prompted a survey of RPMI 8226V in some human and marmoset cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The assays included the RIA for p36, nucleic acid hybridization using cDNA of RPMI 8226V, reverse transcriptase analysis and electron microscopy (EM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results clearly show that in addition to RPMI 8226, human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells BJAB/B-95-8/K which were supertransformed by EBV from B-95-8/K marmoset cells as well as marmoset cell lines [(B-95-8/K and B-95-8/N) obtained from Stockholm and Uppsala, Sweden] were positive for the RPMI 8226V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar lines obtained elsewhere were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results obtained clearly indicate that RPMI 8226V is a serious laboratory contamination in some widely used human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The possible impact of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> contamination for some virological and cell biological studies is discussed </plain></SENT>
