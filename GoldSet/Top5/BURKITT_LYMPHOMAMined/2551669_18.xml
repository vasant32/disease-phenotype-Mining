<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc allele can be induced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> did activate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc alleles in Raji(P207), BL36, P3HR1, Jijoye and LY91 cells, but not in Raji(DE88), BL41, BL67, LY47 and KK124 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> derived from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele appeared 6 h after treatment with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and showed the characteristic preferential usage of the second promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This induction could not be inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the differences in c-myc induction in Raji(P207) and Raji(DE88) cells, c-fos and the early Epstein-Barr virus gene DR were induced to a similar extent and with similar kinetics by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nuclear run-on experiments suggest that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc allele in Raji cells is activated at least in part by releasing a block to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> elongation at the end of c-myc exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the translocated c-myc alleles was also affected by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>; however, only if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> was simultaneously present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> induced a rapid decrease of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> derived from the translocated allele within 6 h, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> alone led to abolition of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> after 16-24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This rapid decline of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was observed in Raji and BL41 cells, but not in three cell lines with variant t(2;8) and t(8;22) translocations </plain></SENT>
