<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homologous recombination between the chromosomal gene locus and an appropriately designed targeting vector results in an alteration or knockout of the gene of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homologous recombination is easily performed in yeast or in murine embryonic stem cells, but is cumbersome in more differentiated and diploid somatic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe an efficient method for targeting both alleles of a complex human gene locus in DG75 cells, a cell line of lymphoid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental approach included a conditional knockout strategy with three genotypic markers, which greatly facilitated the generation and phenotypic identification of targeted recombinant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vector was designed such that it could be reused for two consecutive rounds of recombination to target both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The human DG75 cell line appears similar to the chicken DT40 pre B-cell line, which supports efficient homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the DG75 cell line is a favorable addition to the limited number of cell lines amenable to gene targeting and should prove useful for studying gene function through targeted gene alteration or deletion in human somatic cells </plain></SENT>
