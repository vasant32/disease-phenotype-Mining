<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two factors contribute to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) pathogenesis, a chromosomal translocation leading to c-myc oncogene deregulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the virus has B cell growth-transforming ability, this may not relate to its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> since many of the transforming proteins are not expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mounting evidence supports an alternative role, whereby EBV counteracts the high apoptotic sensitivity inherent to the c-myc-driven growth program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In that regard, a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> carry virus mutants in a novel form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> that provides unusually strong resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Uniquely, these virus mutants use Wp (a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoter normally activated early in B cell transformation) and express a broader-than-usual range of latent antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, using an inducible system to express the candidate antigens, we show that this marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance is mediated not by one of the extended range of EBNAs seen in Wp-restricted latency but by Wp-driven expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> bcl2 homologue, BHRF1, a protein usually associated with the virus lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this Wp/BHRF1 connection is not confined to Wp-restricted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> but appears integral to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell transformation by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that the BHRF1 gene expression recently reported in newly infected B cells is temporally linked to Wp activation and the presence of W/BHRF1-spliced transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, just as Wp activity is never completely eclipsed in in vitro-transformed lines, low-level BHRF1 transcripts remain detectable in these cells long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, recognition by BHRF1-specific T cells confirms that such lines continue to express the protein independently of any lytic cycle entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work therefore provides the first evidence that BHRF1, the EBV bcl2 homologue, is constitutively expressed as a latent protein in growth-transformed cells in vitro and, in the context of Wp-restricted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, may contribute to virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
