<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently established LCL failed to grow both in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some of the LCL which had developed secondary chromosomal alterations during continuous cultivation for periods exceeding several years were tumorigenic and/or had the capacity to form colonies in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines formed colonies in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the two <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines formed subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> which, however, showed no progressive growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> line failed to grow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines, however, formed colonies in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line was tumorigenic while two of the three tested lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines failed to grow in the mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> lines formed colonies in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude from this study that: (1) Of the two types of Epstein-Barr virus containing cell lines [LCL and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines], only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were shown to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> when inoculated subcutaneously in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and had the capacity to grow in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This shows that EBV transformation per se does not necessarily render lymphocytes tumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The capacity to form colonies in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> is not acquired either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) Changes of the karyotype and several phenotypic characteristics which occur in the originally diploid LCL during prolonged cultivation in vitro may be accompanied by the acquisition of the potential to grow subcutaneously in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(3) The inconsistency with regard to the capacity of come of the neoplastic cell lines to grow in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice or in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> seems to underline that neither of the two tests is a reliable criterion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
