<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As a new model to elucidate molecular mechanisms in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activation, we tested the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible (Tet-On)/BZLF1-oriP plasmid system in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells transfected with this Tet-On plasmid did not activate EBV by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> and surprisingly EBV latency was disrupted with large amounts of BMRF1 protein (EA-D) being accumulated in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brilliant EA-D fluorescence was markedly condensed in small sized cells, intra-cellular vesicles, and extra-cellular particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the extra-cellular particles to be covered with a membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EA-D molecules of 58, 50, 48, and 44kDa were expressed in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high (58 and 50kDa) and low (48 and 44kDa) EA-D molecules appeared in the early and late stages, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low EA-D molecules were detected mostly in EA-D positive cells separated into the heaviest density layer of a discontinuous Percoll gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such molecules could be created from high EA-D molecules by protein phosphatase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EA-D molecules that appeared similar were detected in EBV-activated P3HR-1 and Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses concerning the accumulation of EA-D molecules of various polymorphic forms and their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in this model system are presented, with possible biological and clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
