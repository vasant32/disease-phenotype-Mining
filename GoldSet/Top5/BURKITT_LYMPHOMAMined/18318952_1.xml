<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the value of fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy (FNAB) in routine paediatric practice in resource-limited settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To provide an overview of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> paediatric FNAB samples received at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa over a 3-year period, including the determinants of sample adequacy and the diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples were analysed from three locations: Tygerberg Hospital (TBH) where pathologists performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the procedures, surrounding clinics where aspirates were mostly performed by doctors with no formal training in FNAB technique, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi where FNABs were performed by trained nurse aspirators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 830 aspirates were reviewed: 464 (56%) from TBH, 264 (32%) from local clinics and 102 (12%) from Blantyre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main diagnoses at TBH were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026918" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mycobacterial infection</z:e> (31%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/reactive tissue (27%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (14%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> dominated (74%) in the select group from Blantyre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sample adequacy rates were similar between pathologists and nurse aspirators [399/464 vs 82/102, odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8-2.6] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were significantly better in the group who received formal training (TBH and Malawi) than in the clinics where clinicians had no formal training (481/566 vs 171/264, OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.2-4.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FNAB provides a definitive tissue diagnosis in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Well-trained nurse aspirators perform as well as pathologists, indicating the feasibility of FNAB in resource-limited settings </plain></SENT>
