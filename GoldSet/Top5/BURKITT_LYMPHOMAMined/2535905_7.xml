<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These four transcripts were also detected in immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Namalwa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5.0-kb transcript hybridized with the EBNA-3A probe; a 8.5-kb transcript hybridized with the EBNA-3B and -3C probes; and a 5.6- and a 3.6-kb transcript hybridized with the EBNA-3C probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing and cDNA analysis showed that the EBNA-3C transcripts contained exons of the most rightward BamHI-E open reading frames, BERF-3 and BERF-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sequencing of cDNA clones revealed exons in the 5' portion homologous to regions in EBV BamHI-C, -W, and -U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hybridization experiments with EBV BamHI-W and -U probes identified the 8.5- and 5.6-kb transcripts but not the 3.6-kb transcript in LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Organization of these transcripts from the EBNA-3 family is discussed </plain></SENT>
