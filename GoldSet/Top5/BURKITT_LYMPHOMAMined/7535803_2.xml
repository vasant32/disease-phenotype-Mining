<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival material was obtained from 30 cases of childhood Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> registered with the West Midlands Regional Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> Research Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were analysed by a standard avidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex immunoperoxidase method using antibodies to CD45, CD43, CD30, CD20, CD15, and immunoglobulin heavy and light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a high incidence of the CD45RB and CD20 immunophenotypes, with a clearly recognisable B cell lineage even in archival material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgM was identifiable in 13 of the 23 (56.5%) cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three of 17 (18%) cases expressed CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive membrane staining with CD45RO was observed in two (6.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A B cell lineage can be identified in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material, even in archival tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a low incidence of membrane staining with CD45RO which is a potential source of diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
