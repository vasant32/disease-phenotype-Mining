<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined a series of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) for evidence of expression of the MYC gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples derived from 11 non-malignant reactive lymphoid tissues and 33 NHL was used to investigate expression of MYC, MYCL and MYCN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected MYC expression was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of MYC expression were quantified by densitometry and appeared to be 3-8 fold higher in high grade NHL than in the low grade NHL or non-malignant lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No expression of MYCL was detected in any sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of MYCN was however observed in one sample, which had been diagnosed as a T-cell high grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed cytogenetic analysis of this sample proved difficult to obtain but, by using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), we were able to demonstrate that on one of the chromosomes 2 the MYCN gene was localised to a translocation breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It therefore appears that in NHL it is possible for MYCN, like MYC in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, to be activated as a result of a chromosome translocation event </plain></SENT>
