<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were superinfected by EBV from the P3HR-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve to 96 hr after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> the cells were fixed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> and made permeable by saponin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies to the diffuse (D) and restricted (R) components of the early antigen (EA) complex were applied to the cells followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi>-conjugated goat antibodies specific for the heavy chain isotypes of the monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence flow cytometry revealed a clear separation in fluorescence intensity between cells containing EA-R or EA-D and negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A major proportion of EA-positive cells displayed both antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant fraction expressed either EA-R or EA-D but not both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of EA occurred more rapidly and peaked earlier in Daudi cells than in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This apparent difference in EA expression between the two cell lines, however, was much less pronounced when one considered the proportion of cells expressing EA-R only, EA-D only, or both EA-R and EA-D, as a percentage of the total EA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parallel fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that the variation of the ratio of EA-R to EA-D expression with time correlated well between the two methods </plain></SENT>
