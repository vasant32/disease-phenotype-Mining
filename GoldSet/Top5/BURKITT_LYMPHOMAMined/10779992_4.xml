<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the role of IGF-I in the neoplastic process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in children, the authors have determined the number of IGF-I binding sites on circulating mononuclear cells of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children, using binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IGF-I binding sites per cell on peripheral mononuclear cells of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> decreased compared to those of the control group (411 +/- 73 and 1334 +/- 227, respectively, p &lt; .001), while their affinity increased (Kd = 0.14 +/- 0.04 and 0.43 +/- 0.16, respectively, p = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the patients, the number of the IGF-I binding sites was significantly lower in the subgroup of the peripheral mononuclear cells, which included lymphocytes and monocytes, as compared to their number in the peripheral blast cells (254 +/- 43.6 and 536 +/- 98.6, respectively, p = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction was found in serum GHBP levels in the patients as compared to the controls (28.21 +/- 1.93 and 35.83 +/- 2.90, respectively, p = .02), while serum IGF-I and growth hormone levels were similar in patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a possible involvement of IGF-I in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, but further studies are needed to establish whether IGF-I plays a role in this disease </plain></SENT>
