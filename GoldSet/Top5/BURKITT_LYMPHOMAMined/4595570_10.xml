<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Designated as LANA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-associated nuclear antigen), the reactivity differs from that of the Epstein-Barr-virus-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) in immunological specificity and morphological appearance, although it is visualized by the same method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients gave positive reactions in 73% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the sera were positive in 35, 14, 19, and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> and two of eleven <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> sera were also positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 61 healthy controls, 58 were negative, whereas three showed a diffuse nuclear staining with a different pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 24 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients, 18 were negative, whereas six gave a nuclear staining with a different, diffuse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sera from 20 patients who had recovered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to the blasts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, a similar reactivity was seen with two Epstein-Barr virus DNA and EBNA-negative African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies and in a short-lived tissue culture line derived from one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LANA could be a fetal or tissue-specific antigen, a virally determined antigen, or a specific form of anti-nuclear reactivity </plain></SENT>
