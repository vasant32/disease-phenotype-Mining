<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> induction by intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53181">pristane</z:chebi> in mice is controlled by multiple genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least two of these genes reside on mouse chromosome 4 in regions of the genome sharing linkage homology with human chromosomes 9p21, 1p32, and 1p36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A series of congenic strains recombinant for regions of mouse chromosome 4 in the vicinity of the Pctr2 predisposition locus were created and typed for their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> susceptibility/resistance phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These strains were derived by introgressively backcrossing alleles from resistant <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice onto the susceptible BALB/cAnPt background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six resistant and two susceptible strains were allelotyped for 10 genes and 49 random DNA markers to identify the smallest region of overlap in the resistant strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies have determined that the Pctr2 locus resides in either a 500-kb interval proximal to Nppa, or in a 1- to 2-centiMorgan (cM) interval distal to Nppa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these congenic strain analyses, the Nppa and Fv1 loci, in addition to genes within about 1 cM of these loci, have been excluded as candidates for the Pctr2 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relevant locus that may reside in this interval is Rep2; it is associated with the efficiency of repairing X-ray induced DNA damage sustained during the G2 phase of the mitotic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Pctr2 locus acts in a codominant fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>F1 hybrids between resistant and susceptible congenic strains exhibit a <z:mp ids='MP_0002052'>reduced tumor incidence</z:mp> and a significant delay in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification and eventual cloning of the Pctr2 locus may assist in the identification of genes involved in many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> showing aberrations in human chromosome 1p36 </plain></SENT>
