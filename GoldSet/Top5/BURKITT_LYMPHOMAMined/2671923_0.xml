<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first period is characterized by 3 features: the description of the occupational <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (radiations, <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>) with more recently the war <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (Hiroshima), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> induced by chemotherapy; the description of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> of animals induced by viruses (chicken, mice and more over cats); and the concept of the geographical hematology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second period may be called "Burkitt period" so important are the consequences of the discoveries made in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third period is Japanese and American with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> induced by the virus HTLV 1 and the recent extensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such is the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present is defined by strong data (diversity of causes, diversity of the combinations of causes, of the etiologic pluralism), and by persisting weaknesses (epidemiology, classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three ways for the future: induction, prediction, and correlation with the hope of an efficient prevention </plain></SENT>
