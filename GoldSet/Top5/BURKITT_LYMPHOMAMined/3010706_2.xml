<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since some Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines express Tac antigen and can be triggered to secrete IL-2 following activation with the new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter teleocidin, we addressed the question of whether the induction of IL-2 by B lymphocytes is accompanied by the induction of IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma has not been detected in any of the 25 cell lines studied, and following stimulation with teleocidin, we triggered the synthesis of IFN-gamma in JLP(C), a pre-Burkitt's cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of IFN-gamma secretion by B lymphocytes is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that the synthesis of IL-2 by B cells is not accompanied by IFN-gamma and suggest that the synthesis of IFN-gamma is not mediated by IL-2 or IL-1 or B-cell growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutralization studies have shown that IFN-gamma secretion is not accompanied by the induction of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data imply that B cells can be triggered to secrete IFN-gamma under certain circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether similar function occurs in vivo is not known </plain></SENT>
