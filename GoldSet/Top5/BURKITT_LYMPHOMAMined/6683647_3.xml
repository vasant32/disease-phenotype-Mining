<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed 8 (16%) non-responders (NR), 8 (16%) partial (PR) and 33 (67%) complete responders (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PR + NR were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dead by the 10th observation month, while the survival graph plateaued at 70% around the 10th month for CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We projected that 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluable patients would experience prolonged survival beyond the 12th observation month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three and 5 CR relapsed systemically and in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus 11, 10 and 3 of 26 treatment failures were directly attributable to resistance to chemotherapy, sanctuary effect of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> or both respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> were responsible for the other two failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that drug resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and pharmacological sanctuary effect of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> are the major problems in the chemotherapeutic eradication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
