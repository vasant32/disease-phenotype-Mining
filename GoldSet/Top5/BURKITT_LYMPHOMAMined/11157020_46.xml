<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To improve the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we tested a newly developed uricolytic agent, recombinant urate oxidase (SR29142; Rasburicase; Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc, Paris, France), which catalyzes the oxidation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15676">allantoin</z:chebi>, a highly water-soluble metabolite readily excreted by the kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered Rasburicase intravenously, at 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg, for 5 to 7 consecutive days to 131 children, adolescents, and young adults with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, who either presented with abnormally high plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> concentrations or had large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell burdens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were measured daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of Rasburicase, the urinary excretion rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15676">allantoin</z:chebi>, and antibodies to Rasburicase were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At either dosage, the recombinant enzyme produced a rapid and sharp decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median level decreased by 4 hours after treatment, from 9.7 to 1 mg/dL (P =.0001), in the 65 patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo>, and from 4.3 to 0.5 mg/dL (P =.0001) in the remaining 66 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite cytoreductive chemotherapy, plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> concentrations remained low throughout the treatment (daily median level, 0.5 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The urinary excretion rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15676">allantoin</z:chebi> increased during Rasburicase treatment, peaking on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> concentrations did not change significantly during the first 3 days of treatment, decreased significantly by day 4 in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> (P =.0003), and fell within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by 48 hours after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels decreased significantly after 1 day of treatment in patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis (P =.0003 and P =.02, respectively) and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by day 6 of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was negligible, and none of the patients required dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma half-lives of the agent were 16.0 +/- 6.3 (SD) hours and 21.1 +/- 12.0 hours, respectively, in patients treated at dosages of 0.15 or 0.20 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 121 assessable patients developed antibodies to the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rasburicase is safe and highly effective for the prophylaxis or treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002149'>hyperuricemia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
