<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to distinguish specific from nonspecific targeting of the xenograft, the mice can be implanted with different malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied in xenograft success and growth rates after implantation of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells to begin an assessment of the validity of this approach for distinguishing specific from nonspecific targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigations were undertaken to determine the effect of two different cell-line xenografts, and prior radiation needed for one of the xenografts, on implantation success and growth rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Female athymic mice were given 4 Gy of external beam radiation 4 days prior to subcutaneous (s.c.) abdominal implantation of 6 x 10(6) Raji human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week later, 3 x 10(6) hamster blood transfusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi>) 3477 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells were implanted s.c. in a contralateral abdominal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Xenografts were evaluated frequently thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Xenograft success and growth rates were compared to those observed in "historical" control groups, wherein only a single xenograft of each type was implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Raji xenografts developed from 73.7% of the implantations, and 100% of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenografts were successful in the experimental group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The "historical" Raji xenograft success rate was 74.1% (+/-9.3%), and the "historical" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenografts success rate was 99.0% (+/-1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenografts did not affect the growth rate of the Raji xenografts, and the mean doubling time for the experimental Raji xenografts was 6.3 days (+/-4.5 days), compared to the "historical" control group mean of 5.1 days (+/-3.9 days; p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the growth rates for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenografts were not affected by the Raji xenografts and the pre-radiation needed for this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean doubling time for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenografts in the presence of Raji xenografts was 9.2 days (+/-17.6 days), compared to a doubling time of 1.4 days (+/-15.2 days; p = 0.55 and 0.94 studies 1 and 2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 xenograft doubling time for the "historical" control group was 4.4 days (+/-6.0 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of Raji xenografts and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="115196">HBT</z:chebi> 3477 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> xenografts in the same mouse did not affect xenograft success or growth rates, even when whole-body radiation of 4 Gy was used to promote Raji xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These observations are not intended to imply an absence of differences in other biological parameters in this sytem or to encourage extrapolation of the conclusions indiscriminately to other preclinical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Contrarily, our aim was to encourage other investigators to further validate these frequently used approaches </plain></SENT>
