<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among family members, titers greater than 1:4 were found in 98% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV), 86% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster</z:e> virus (VZV), 100% FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV), AND 94% FOR Epstein-Barr (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Titers in patients averaged approximately equal to 2 logs (fourfold) higher than those in matched controls for EBV, VZV, and CMV (P EQUALS 0.001); titers for HSV were only slightly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mothers of patients had someuhat higher EBV titers (0.05 smaller than or equal to P SMALLER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.01) than the mothers of controls, but no other differences between patient and control families were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunofluorescence, a method which apparently has not been used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four human herpesviruses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients, the patients had elevated antibody titers not only to EBV but also to CMV and VZV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elevated titers to three of the four human herpesviruses were not due to serologic cross reactions </plain></SENT>
