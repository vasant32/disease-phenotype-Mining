<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining has remained the standard diagnostic method for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancillary tests including immunohistochemistry, not widely available in developing countries, are important tools in verifying the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with equivocal morphological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining in the diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using immunohistochemistry as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Pathology laboratory, Makerere University Medical School, Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: One hundred and thirty eight formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsies of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed from January 2001 to December 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 138 tumours, 88.4% were extra-nodal: jaw 36.2%, ovary 21%, gastrointestinal tract 12.3% other abdominal 11.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Males (55.8%) predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin were 93.2% and 50% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative predictive values were 91.7% and 55.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Histology using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining is sensitive in the diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not very specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with CD20, Ki-67 and bcl-2 is necessary for difficult cases </plain></SENT>
