<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) was shown to be capable of inducing maturation toward plasmacytoid-like cells in immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to induce the enzyme in 5'-NT-negative B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> to clarify the relationship between 5'-NT and B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 days in the presence or absence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, these cell lines were examined morphologically, and their 5'-NT activity, Ig secretion, surface Ig, and Ia, B1, and B2 antigens were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither Ig secretion nor 5'-NT activity was induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in any of 4 nonsecreting cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ig secretion was significantly increased in 4 of 5 lg-secreting cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these inducible cell lines, JD 38 and ST 486, became positive for 5'-NT activity and acquired morphologic characteristics of plasma cells after culture with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line JD 38 was transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and gave rise to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells remained negative for 5'-NT, they could be induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> to express both the enzyme activity and plasmacytoid-like appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that in the Ig-secreting B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, there was an association between the inducibility of 5'-NT and the capacity of these cell lines to undergo plasma-cytoid-like transformation in response to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
