<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report evidence that the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor is present and may be functioning on blast cells from some patients with myeloid surface antigen positive (My+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a human G-CSF receptor expression plasmid was transfected into a newly established B-lineage ALL cell line 'Tanoue' and its subclone 'ST' by lipofection to investigate whether expression of the G-CSF receptor and G-CSF stimulation would induce myeloid characteristics on myeloid surface antigen negative (My-) ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The G-CSF receptor became detectable on the transfected cells (GR-Tanoue and GR-ST), with dissociation constant values of 50-130 pmol/l, and maximal binding sites (Bmax of 77-6100 sites/cell on receptor binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short term culture with recombinant human G-CSF induced myeloid differentiation (a two to three-fold increase in CD33 and CD15 expression), and a moderate 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake (stimulation index, 1.75) only in the GR-ST clone no. 15 which expressed a high number of G-CSF receptors (Bmax, 6100 sites/cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data show that (a) exogenous expression of the G-CSF receptor and G-CSF stimulation can induce myeloid characteristics on ALL cells; and (b) in the G-CSF receptor-expressing cells, there is a correlation between the number of G-CSF receptors and cell responsiveness to G-CSF in either proliferation or differentiation </plain></SENT>
