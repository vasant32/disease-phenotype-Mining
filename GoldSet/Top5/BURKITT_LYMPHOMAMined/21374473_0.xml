<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SBA has been used, therefore, to fractionate a variety of cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SBA binds approx 60-90% of bone marrow mononuclear cells, including mature myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid cells, but has very low binding affinity and no toxic effect to the human hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it binds very effectively to certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these characteristics, SBA has multiple potential applications for clinical bone marrow, transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
