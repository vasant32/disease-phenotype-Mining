<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experiments have been carried out to identify the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> components of the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-determined membrane antigen (MA) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were radioiodinated using lactoperoxidase and the 125I-labelled surface antigens, released by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X100, were analysed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) after complexing either with human sera having anti-MA activity or with a rabbit antiserum to EB virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cells carrying EB virus isolated from four different conditions, including for the first time nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), we have demonstrated four major <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One, with a molecular weight of 85,000, was remarkedly constant irrespective of the cell line from which it came; two, with molecular weights varying from 240,000 to 270,000 and from 320,000 to 340,000, showed minor differences in mobility apparently depending on the species of origin of the cells (human or marmoset), rather than disparity between strains of virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fourth component, of 160,000 daltons, was found on only two of the cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been shown for the first time that the same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> composing the MA complex are present on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> envelope itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that the rabbit antiserum to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> virus recognized only the two highest molecular weight MA components, yet showed virus-neutralizing activity, indicates the importance of these two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> for use in a vaccine designed to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
