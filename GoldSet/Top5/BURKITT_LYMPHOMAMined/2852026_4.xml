<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of c-fgr was studied in a series of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and their EBV-converted derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two transcripts, of 2.9 kb and 3.5 kb, were present at dramatically elevated levels following EBV-conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structure of the c-fgr transcripts was studied by the isolation and nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the c-fgr protein encoded by the mature <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> would contain 529 amino acids and have a molecular weight of approximately 58,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The N-terminus of the predicted c-fgr protein has low amino acid homology with the N-termini of other members of this family of proteins, suggesting a cell specific function for the N-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the c-fgr cDNA clones also revealed the presence of alternative functional polyadenylation signals, although the use of these does not account for the size difference between the two major c-fgr transcripts </plain></SENT>
