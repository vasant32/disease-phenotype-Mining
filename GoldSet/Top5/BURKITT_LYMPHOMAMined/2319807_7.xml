<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nature of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor on purified human B lymphocytes was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells showed evidence of a 70-75,000 mol. wt (p75) IL-2 binding molecule as assessed by 125I-labeled IL-2 binding and receptor cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, Tac-negative B lymphocytes the estimated number of p75 binding sites was 1100 per cell and the dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.7 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, cross-linking experiments demonstrated the presence of an IL-2 binding molecule of 70-75,000 mol. wt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purified B cells from patients with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) also expressed the p75 IL-2 binding molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the HCL samples, a small number of high-affinity IL-2 binding sites were detected (27-90) while the majority of binding sites (2100-10,800) were typical of low-affinity p55 Tac binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-2 added to the purified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and CLL B lymphocytes led to the induction of p55 Tac expression and the generation of high-affinity IL-2 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This response to IL-2 was equivalent to the response observed when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes were stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I </plain></SENT>
