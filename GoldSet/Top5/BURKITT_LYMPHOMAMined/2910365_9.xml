<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in marrow blasts from 77 of 104 (74%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperdiploidy was much more frequent in B-lineage ALL cases, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploidy was more common in T-lineage ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine of 104 cases (46 of 78 B-lineage ALL and 13 of 26 T-lineage ALL cases) had structural chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities involving 2p11, 7p13, 7p22, proximal q arm of 7 (7q11 or 7q22), 11q23-24, and translocations involving 12p11-13 appeared to be B-lineage specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By comparison, structural abnormalities involving 7p15, 7q32, and 14q11 displayed T-lineage specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities involving 9p22-p23 or 14q32, del (6)(q21-q23), del (12)(p11-p13), and the Philadelphia chromosome were found in B-lineage as well as T-lineage ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study expands the current knowledge about immunophenotype-karyotype associations in ALL </plain></SENT>
