<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear, however, whether this functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> reflects the action of different monocyte subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We separated human blood monocytes into distinct populations using a discontinuous (15-35%) serum albumin gradient technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined if any of a number of monocyte functions were preferentially expressed by these five monocyte subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monocytes in the 25% and 30% albumin fractions possessed more Fc (IgG) and C3 receptor activity than did monocytes in either of the 15, 20 or 35% fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, monocytes isolated in the more dense albumin fractions were enriched for the capacity to support pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> gradient fractions were equally capable of binding Raji cells and inhibiting Raji cell incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that fractionation of monocytes by a discontinuous albumin gradient is an effective method to enrich for those monocytes with certain functional characteristics </plain></SENT>
