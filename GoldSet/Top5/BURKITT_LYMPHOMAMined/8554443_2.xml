<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Between 2% and 9% of cardiac transplant recipients develop posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, which includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are usually aggressive Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell proliferations similar to those seen in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective pathologic study of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue from 21 cardiac transplant recipients with posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> histology, immunohistochemistry, immunophenotyping, and DNA analysis for clonal gene rearrangement and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The mean patient age was 53.4 +/- 10.2 years (range 33-67 years); 33% of the patients were alive at the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histologically, the samples comprised one Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, three diffuse mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, eight diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (93%) of 14 samples were infiltrated by small reactive T cells; five of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> qualified as T-cell rich </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 14 cases studied, 12 had clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, 1 had oligoclonal bands, and 1 exhibited only a germline pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The B cells were CD10+, CD19+, and CD20+, and the reactive T cells were CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, CD8+, and CD57+ by immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this patient series, morphologically aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and disseminated disease occurred early as well as late after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a reactive T-cell component, which may represent a host attempt at controlling the B-cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
