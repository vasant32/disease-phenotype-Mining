<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression and distribution of BL2 on benign and malignant human lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescent assay with this monoclonal antibody demonstrated that BL2 is expressed by cells within the fetal liver and by a variable proportion of lymph node, tonsil, and spleen B cells, but not by T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells isolated from 18 T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were BL2-  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BL2 was was heterogeneously expressed by a variable proportion of the malignant cells in 29/32 cases of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and 33/38 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but appeared to be lost in the terminal stages of B-cell differentiation, as <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> plasma cells were BL2-  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BL2 expression was not limited to B cells of a particular surface immunoglobulin isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent staining for BL2 in cryostat tissue sections demonstrated that the majority, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, germinal center and interfollicular Ia+ (non-T) cells are BL2+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that BL2 is a B-cell lineage-specific differentiation marker that may be useful in the study of B-cell ontogeny and in defining subgroups of the B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
