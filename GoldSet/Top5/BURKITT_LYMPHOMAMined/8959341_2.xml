<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The level of cyclin D3 at 72 h postinfection was two to three times higher than in the exponentially growing LCLs, as detected by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It was still 5-10 times lower than in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
