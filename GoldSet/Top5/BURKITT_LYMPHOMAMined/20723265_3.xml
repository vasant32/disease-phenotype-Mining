<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are at present only partially understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The effects of RES on activation of unfolded protein responses (UPR) were evaluated using Western blotting, semi-quantitative and real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated using Annexin V/PI staining and subsequent FACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similar as tunicamycin, treatment with RES lead to the activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 branches of the UPR, with early splicing of XBP-1 indicative of IRE1 activation, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha consistent with ER resident kinase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>) activation, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) splicing, and increase in expression levels of the downstream molecules GRP78/BiP, GRP94 and CHOP/GADD153 in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji and Daudi cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RES was shown to induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which could be attenuated by thwarting upregulation of CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that activation of the apoptotic arm of the UPR and its downstream effector CHOP/GADD153 is involved, at least in part, in RES-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
