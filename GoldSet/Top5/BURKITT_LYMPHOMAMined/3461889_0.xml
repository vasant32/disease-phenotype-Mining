<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We refer to these as "Intelligent Workstations" because they accommodate the hypothesis-driven reasoning ability of the user into the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with the rapid developments in computers, diagnostic and therapeutic technologies related to cell analysis have undergone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combining these technologies requires careful formulation and analysis of the diagnostic model involving image cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we present a model of the intelligent workstation for image cytometry and illustrate its advantages in cell-surface phenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combining cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with cell-surface phenotyping has clear diagnostic utility that no other widely available methods can supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the reported results are based on samples of peripheral blood, cell suspensions of disaggregated cells can also be analyzed </plain></SENT>
