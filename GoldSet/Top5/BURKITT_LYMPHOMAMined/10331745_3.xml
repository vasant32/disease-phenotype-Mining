<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 3p14.2 chromosome region, which contains the FHIT gene and the FRA3B fragile site, is frequently altered in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the expression of the FHIT gene in 21 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (80%) of these cell lines had a common aberrant FHIT transcript as well as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exon 2 was often aberrantly spliced to several coding exons, skipping exons 3 and 4, which overlap FRA3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other aberrant transcripts lacked exons 4-7 or exons 5-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 5, which has the initiation codon, was the most commonly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two cell lines, Raji and KK124, there were aberrant transcripts retaining only the coding exons, which were able to make a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein, as demonstrated by in vitro transcription-translation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these aberrant messages, the additional deletion of 11 nucleotides at the beginning of exon 10 resulted in loss of translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cell line Ramos did not have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some transcripts had common insertions of unknown origin that replaced coding exons, mainly exons 6 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of these aberrant messages coded for a protein, whether <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or aberrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Within an individual cell line, aberrant messages appeared to result from sequential splicing reactions of a transcriptional unit derived from one allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between aberrant FHIT transcription and the type of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> regarding chromosomal translocation or presence of Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsils, spleen, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, aberrant transcripts were not detected and might represent a very minor subpopulation if detectable </plain></SENT>
