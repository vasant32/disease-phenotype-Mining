<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of oncolytic viruses has received considerable attention in recent years and many viruses have proved to be effective against a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516211" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">cancer models</z:e> and a few are currently being used in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the possible emergence and outcome of virus-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the effective use of reovirus against lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we isolated in vitro persistently infected (PI) Raji cells, and cells 'cured' of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> ('cured' cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both PI and cured Raji cells resisted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> and cell killing in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the PI cells were non-tumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice, but cured cells regained the parental cells' ability to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> xenografts from the cured cells, however, were highly susceptible to reovirus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333516" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncolysis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This susceptibility was due to the proteolytic environment within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> that facilitates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> and cell killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> by reovirus impedes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development and that although PI cells cleared of reovirus are tumorigenic, they are killed upon rechallenge with reovirus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the PI and cured states are therefore not likely to be significant barriers to reovirus oncolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
