<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 55-year-old HIV-negative white male presented with right ear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, right axillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of the peripheral smear demonstrated the presence of increased circulating blast-like cells of intermediate size, with basophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with open chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain was compatible with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">labyrinthitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excisional biopsy of the axillary mass revealed an enlarged lymph node with effaced architecture and "starry sky" appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells expressed CD20, CD10, BCL6, and surface kappa immunoglobulin light chain, with a high proliferative index by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular (approximately 95%), with blast-like cells virtually replacing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Routine karyotype as well as FISH analysis of bone marrow cells demonstrated rearrangement of the MYC gene at chromosome 8q24 region, IGH/MYC fusion, and additional signal for IGH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We present herein a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurring in a previously healthy HIV-negative male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The unusual clinical findings in this case include the relatively older age at presentation (55 years), an immunocompetent patient who had nodal involvement and leukemic phase of Burkitt, coupled with partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A brief educational review of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> is made </plain></SENT>
