<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA molecules, which do not migrate in the gels, are the precursors for the mature <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Centrifugation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23614">deoxycholate</z:chebi>-treated infected nuclei in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradients revealed that most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA co-sedimented with the cellular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA-dependent <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase activity also co-sedimented with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of nuclei isolated from HSV-infected cells, under in vitro conditions that support DNA synthesis, resulted in the synthesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> molecules of low molecular weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under the same conditions, nuclei from Burkitt lymphoblasts did not synthesize DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nature of the association between cellular DNA and EBV DNA was studied by hybridization with EBV cRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV-specific sequences were found in the lymphoblast DNA; they banded at a density of 1.707 g/cm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcribed in HSV-infected nuclei is symmetrically transcribed from HSV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The symmetrical portions of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> are removed, since poly (A)-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> molecules lack homologous sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesized in HSV-infected nuclei can be released after incubation of the nuclei in vitro in the presence of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The released <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> consists of poly(A)plus and poly (A)-minus molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transport from the nuclei still remains to be studied </plain></SENT>
