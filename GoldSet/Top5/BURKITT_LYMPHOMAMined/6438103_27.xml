<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Ramos, Daudi, Put) were characterized by a high chemical quantity of Gb3, high enzyme activity for synthesis of Gb3 (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>:LacCer alpha-galactosyltransferase), and a high degree of surface exposure of Gb3, as determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase/NaB[3H]4 and by cytofluorometry with the monoclonal antibody to Gb3 (38.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines (Priess, Remb1, and ARH77) were characterized by the absence of Gb3 at the cell surface detected by cytofluorometry or cell-surface labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell lines Priess and Remb1 did not contain Gb3 and showed a low alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the cell line ARH77, though it did not express Gb3 at the cell surface, was found to contain a large chemical quantity of Gb3 and a high level of alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, Gb3 of ARH77 cells was exposed by sialidase treatment, but not by protease treatment, although Gb3 itself was not sialylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The crypticity of Gb3 in ARH77 cells could be associated with an adjacent sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate at the cell surface, in the same way as Gg3 in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> L5178 (Urdal, D </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression in Burkitt and non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is dependent on (i) Gb3 synthesis due to alpha-galactosyltransferase activity and (ii) membrane organization of Gb3, which may be controlled through interaction with the sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate </plain></SENT>
