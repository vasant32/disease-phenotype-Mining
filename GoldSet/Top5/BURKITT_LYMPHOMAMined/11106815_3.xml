<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> with the simultaneous occurrence of a t(2;8)(p12;q24) typically associated with mature B cell or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and a t(12;21)(p13;q22) exclusively associated with pre-B cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lymphoblasts were characterized as L2 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> by the French-American-British classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there were atypical morphologic findings for L2 ALL, including vacuolization in some cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lymphoblasts were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff positive and myeloperoxidase negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that the majority of lymphoblasts were TdT+, CD10+, CD19+, CD20-, and cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These features were consistent with an immature pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> phenotype with some characteristics of a mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A t(2;8)(p12;q24)(p12;q24), characteristic of mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or Burkitt type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, was detected by conventional cytogenetics with no other cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, diagnostic peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens demonstrated simultaneous occurrence of a cryptic t(12;21)(p13;q22) by both FISH and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of these translocations in a pediatric patient have implications for the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with t(2;8)(p12;q24) as well as t(12;21)(p12;q22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of additional cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with translocations involving the MYC locus on 8q24 will be required to determine the frequency of association with the cryptic t(12;21)(p13;22), and the prognostic significance of the simultaneous occurrence of the translocations </plain></SENT>
