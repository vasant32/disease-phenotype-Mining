<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The five chromosome bands 1p32, 1q31, 5q21, 13q21, and 16p13 showed the presence of EBV DNA in both of the lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grain deposition at the site on chromosome 1q of the Burkitt line was particularly intense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also found that EBV DNA in the lymphoblastoid cell line co-localized with a stable achromatic gap at 1p32 whose presence seems to confer a proliferative advantage on the cells </plain></SENT>
