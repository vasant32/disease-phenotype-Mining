<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report detailed immunological, cytogenetic and molecular evidence for complete identity of the leukemic cell populations in monozygotic female twins with concordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosed at two months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both infants had early pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> with the (11;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common clonal origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in these infants was suggested by the finding of identical oligoclonal heavy chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cell DNA was examined for 11q23 rearrangements by Southern blotting and restriction fragments of identical size were found in the two cases, in contrast to the diversity of rearrangements observed in other unrelated and nontwinned control infants with t(11;19)(q23;p13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar restriction fragments were absent in blood mononuclear DNA from both parents, liver tissue from one twin and remission bone marrow of the other, indicating that the 11q23 rearrangement was acquired and not inherited as a chromosomal abnormality or polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a definitive evidence for intrauterine single cell origin, with twin to twin transmission, of concordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in this infant twin pair </plain></SENT>
