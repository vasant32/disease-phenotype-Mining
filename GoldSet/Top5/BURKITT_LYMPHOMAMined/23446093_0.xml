<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this situation, population-based data may represent a useful contribution in order to identify an optimal treatment strategy.Patients and methodsThe aims of this study were to investigate the outcome for adult HIV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with different chemotherapy regimens, and to assess possible improvement within the time frame of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population was identified through the Swedish and Danish <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> registries 2000-2009.ResultsA total of 258 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 2000, overall survival (OS) improved significantly only for younger patients (&lt;65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensive regimens such as the Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster, hyper-fractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (hyper-CVAD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (CODOX-M/IVAC) were associated with a favourable 2-year OS of 82%, 83%, and 69%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low-intensive CHOP/CHOEP regimens achieved a 2-year OS of 38.8%, confirming their inadequacy for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, rituximab was not significantly associated with improved OS.ConclusionsIn this population-based retrospective series of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, intensive chemotherapy regimens were associated with favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of the addition of rituximab remains uncertain and warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
