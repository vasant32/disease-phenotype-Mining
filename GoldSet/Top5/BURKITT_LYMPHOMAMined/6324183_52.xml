<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently identified, by means of cotransformation of LTK- cells, a region of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome (the BamHI K fragment) that encodes or induces an EBV nuclear neoantigen (EBNA) serologically related to the EBNA found in lymphoid cells carrying the entire EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now find that a second EBV DNA fragment, BamHI M, is also able to give rise to cotransformed LTK- cells with stable expression of a nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BamHI K and M fragments have no apparent DNA homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many human sera that are reactive to EBNA in Raji cells detect both antigens; however, certain anti-EBNA-positive human sera are discordant and react only with the BamHI M or only with the BamHI K nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every Raji cell appears to express both "M" and "K" antigens; D98 Raji cells, a somatic cell hybrid, express only "K" antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The K antigen is found on metaphase chromosomes of LTK cells and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The M-induced antigen is not located on chromosomes when the cells are in metaphase but is present as granules within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
