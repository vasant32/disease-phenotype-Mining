<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Contemporary risk adapted treatment protocols for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) rely on accurate risk assessment strategies for disease re-occurrence by incorporating clinical parameters as well as immunological, molecular and cytogenetic features of the blasts at initial manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional risk stratification is provided by analysis of the IN VITRO and IN VIVO response of the blasts towards standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite adapted therapies, a number of children with good and bad prognostic factors still fail therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One approach to this problem might be to incorporate monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) as additional modalities into the first or second line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to identify target antigen structures, we analyzed the immunological expression profiles of blasts from 181 patients with B-cell precursor ALL treated at our institution in 11 years according to the CoALL-92/97/03 protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blasts were classified according to the EGIL guidelines as 9 proB-, 110 common (c-) and 62 preB-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: &gt; 99 and 96 % of patients expressed CD19 and CD22 on &gt; 90 % of their blasts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR on &gt; 95 % blasts was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD10 was expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> c-/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preB-ALL</z:e> and absent on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">proB-ALL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD20 was expressed on 11-37 % of B-cell precursor ALL samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD34 positive blasts were found in 89, 83 and 68 % of patients with proB-, c- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preB-ALL</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD37 expression was detected in 0-18 % of patients. &lt; 20 % CD45(+) blasts were found in 11, 19 and 18 % of patients with proB-, c- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preB-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CD33(+) was expressed on 33, 29 and 21 % of patients samples with proB-, c- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preB-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other myeloid antigens (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD65) were positive on blasts in &lt; 25 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the immunological profile of blasts in 9 consecutive children with relapse revealed that the antigen expression profile varied little compared to the initial diagnosis for CD10, CD19, CD22 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These analyses clearly identified the three antigens CD19, CD22 and HLA-DR present on blasts in more than 90 % of patients as potential target structures for targeted therapies with native or toxin-bound monoclonal antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
