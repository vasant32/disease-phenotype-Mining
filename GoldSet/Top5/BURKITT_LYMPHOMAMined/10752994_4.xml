<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous subtyping studies have however been confined to analysis of sequence variability within a single locus in EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variations have now been reported for several latently expressed EBV genes, including, EBNAs-1, 2 and LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variant EBNA-1 strains have been identified in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and clustering of subtypes for LMP and EBNA-2 have been associated with either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and/or clinical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the linkage between the variability in these three loci in EBV associated with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we subclassified EBV-associated lymphoproliferations (9 reactive and 24 malignant) from HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients by analysis of the EBNA-1, LMP1, and EBNA-2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that (1) EBV identical to the prototype B95.8 strain (Type 1 EBNA-2, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> EBNA-1 and LMP-1) is very rarely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) The EBNA-1 variant V-leucine, restricted to malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immunocompetent patients, was readily identified in non-malignant lesions in HIV infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Variations of EBNA-1 occur independent of variations at other loci </plain></SENT>
