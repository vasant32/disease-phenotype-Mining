<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 7,040 patients who received solid organ transplantation (SOT) and post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight patients developed PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 43), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301361" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polymorphic PTLD</z:e> (n = 10), Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 7), Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (n = 5), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 3) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over-represented in the SOT population compared with a population sample from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database; follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 0) was underrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative pretransplantation Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology was a risk factor for PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Available histologic analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue showed that 75% were CD20 positive and that 62% were EBV positive; EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> occurred sooner after SOT than EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (mean, 29 v 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extralymphatic disease (79%), poor performance status (68%), elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH; 71%), and advanced stage (68%) disease were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of patients had a complete response when treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-like chemotherapy (either with or without rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PTLD was 8.23 years (95% CI, 2.28 to 30.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EBV-na√Øve patients who receive a donor organ from an EBV-infected donor are in the highest-risk situation for PTLD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are CD20 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With treatment, survival of patients with PTLD was indistinguishable from that of the SEER population sample </plain></SENT>
