<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cost effectiveness of treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> in these settings is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present work was to determine cost-effectiveness thresholds for common paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) in Brazil and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) in Malawi as examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented by treatment were compared to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of each country to define cost-effectiveness thresholds using WHO-CHOICE ('CHOosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective') guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The case examples were selected due to the data available and because ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> both have the potential to yield significant health gains at a low cost per patient treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The key findings were as follows: the 3:1 cost/DALY prevented to GDP/capita ratio for ALL in Brazil was US $771,225; expenditures below this threshold were cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs below US $257,075 (1:1 ratio) were considered very cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analogous thresholds for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Malawi were US $42,729 and US $14,243 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actual costs were far less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, US $16,700 was spent to treat each patient while in Malawi total drug costs were less than US $50 per child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, treatment of certain paediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in LMIC is very cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research should evaluate actual treatment and infrastructure expenditures to help guide policymakers </plain></SENT>
