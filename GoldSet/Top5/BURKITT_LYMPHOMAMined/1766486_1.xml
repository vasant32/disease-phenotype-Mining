<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated on the basis of the growth curve and the radiobiological aspects are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the treatment, the initial volume doubling time (Td) of 15 days was shortened to 4.5 days suggesting accelerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From dose response curve estimated for clinical data taken from literature, an effDo of 1.37 Gy was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surviving fraction after 58 Gy given in the twice-a-day regimen (b. i. d.) was 10(-19) suggesting local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, only partial remission was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This nonradical effect may likely result in accelerated repopulation of surviving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> clonogenic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that such a fast growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> as Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Tpot = 1 day) should be irradiated using three instead two fractions per day combined with adjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy with a short intervals between cycles </plain></SENT>
