<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A region of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the B-cell restricted cell differentiation antigen, CD19, has high amino acid sequence similarity to the receptor binding subunit B of verotoxin 1 (VT), an Escherichia coli elaborated cytotoxin, which specifically binds to the cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi>, globotriaosylceramide, also known as the germinal center (GC) B-cell differentiation antigen, CD77 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously provided evidence of the association of CD19 and CD77 on the cell surface and in CD19-mediated homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of which is a subset of GC B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence for the role of CD77 in CD19-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is now presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial cell surface distribution, antibody-induced redistribution, internalization, and intracellular routing of CD19 were studied by confocal microscopy, IF, and postembedding IEM in CD77+ve and CD77-ve cells to investigate the possible role of CD77 in CD19 internalization and signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were used as CD77+ve cells and as CD77-ve cells, Daudi mutant VT500 cells, and Daudi cells treated with PPMP, an inhibitor of CD77 synthesis, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody ligated CD19 surface redistribution, internalization, and subcellular distribution of internalized CD19 was found to be different in CD77+ve and CD77-ve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A delay in internalization of antibody-CD19 complex was observed in CD77-ve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internalized CD19 was targeted to the nuclear envelope in CD77+ve cells in a manner similar to that reported for VT, but not in CD77-ve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internalization of CD77 by ligation with verotoxin prevented the internalization of ligated CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following crosslinking of cell surface CD19 was greater in CD77+ve cells than in CD77-ve cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nuclear targeting of internalized CD19 and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following CD19 crosslinking only in CD77+ve cells indicates a role for CD77-dependent CD19 retrograde transport from the B cell surface via the ER to the nuclear envelope in CD19-mediated signal transduction for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
