<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed biochemical properties of p53 in two different cell lines derived from patients with ALL or ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>p53 was found in elevated levels in both leukemic cell lines compared to unstimulated or stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High levels of p53 in these cell lines are due to an extended stability of p53 protein rather than to different rates of synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 from both cell lines formed low- and high-molecular weight oligomers which revealed that p53 exists in a heterogenous population in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of immunologically different subsets of p53 was demonstrated by sequential immunoprecipitation experiments with different p53 specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed structural and immunological variabilities of p53 in cell lines derived from human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and may thus provide an insight into the role p53 may play in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
