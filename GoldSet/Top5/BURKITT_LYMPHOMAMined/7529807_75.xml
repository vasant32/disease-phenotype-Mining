<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that these V gamma 2V delta 2+ T cells proliferate in response to Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22324">alkyl phosphate</z:chebi> molecules including monoethylphosphate (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>), and an Ag chemically similar to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> purified from mycobacterial extracts of several species including Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This proliferation is polyclonal and determined by the TCR V gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, because these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22324">alkyl phosphate</z:chebi> molecules are so distinct from conventional <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and superantigens, we questioned whether these substances induce gamma delta T cell proliferation via TCR-dependent recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that transfection of TCR- Jurkat T cells with cDNA constructs encoding a V gamma 2V delta 2 TCR enabled the transfectants to produce IL-2 in response to Daudi cells, mycobacterial extract, and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responses were dose dependent and Ag specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate an essential role for the gamma delta TCR in V gamma 2V delta 2 T cell-mediated recognition of non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Ags by human T cells and suggest a structural similarity or cross-reactivity between cellular and microbial Ags recognized by these gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
