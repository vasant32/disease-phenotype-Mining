<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These viruses are closely related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, Human herpesvirus 4) and share similar genomic organization and biological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonhuman primate LCVs have the ability to immortalize host cells and express a similar complement of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic and latent genes as those found in EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that nonhuman primate LCVs can immortalize B cells from genetically related species, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between these viruses and their respective hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early work with EBV in tamarins and owl monkeys revealed that cross species transmission of lymphocryptoviruses from the natural to inadvertent host may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> and the development of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, simian LCVs have the ability to induce malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immunodeficient hosts and have been associated with posttransplantation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> in cynomolgus macaques undergoing solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the comparative pathobiology of lymphocryptoviral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and discuss the derivation of specific pathogen-free animals </plain></SENT>
