<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the role of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is known, no data are available about clinical presentations of NHL subtypes and their relationship to Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) load in peripheral blood of children in north-western, Tanzania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A matched case control study of NHL subtypes was performed in children under 15 years of age and their respective controls admitted to Bugando Medical Centre, Sengerema and Shirati district designated hospitals in north-western, Tanzania, between September 2010 and April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood samples were collected on Whatman 903 filter papers and EBV DNA levels were estimated by multiplex real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data were collected using a structured data collection tool and analysed using chi-square, Fisher and Wilcoxon rank sum tests where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between NHL and detection of EBV in peripheral blood was assessed using conditional logistic regression model and presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 35 NHL cases and 70 controls matched for age and sex were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of NHLs, 32 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> with equal distribution between jaw and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumour</z:e>, 2 had large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and 1 had NHL-not otherwise specified (NHL-NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) presentation occurred only in 1 BL patient; 19 NHLs had stage I and II of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 NHL was found to be HIV-seropositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of 35 (60%) NHL and 21 of 70 (30%) controls had detectable EBV in peripheral blood (OR = 4.77, 95% CI 1.71 - 13.33, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, levels of EBV in blood were significantly higher in NHL cases than in controls (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood NHL</z:e> subtype in north-western Tanzania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NHLs are not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, but are strongly associated with EBV load in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that high levels of EBV in blood might have diagnostic and prognostic relevance in African children </plain></SENT>
