The anti-B4 MoAb is directed against the B-lineage-restricted CD19 antigen expressed on more than 95% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blocked ricin is an altered ricin derivative that has its nonspecific binding eliminated by chemically blocking the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> binding domains of the B chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that the IC37 of Anti-B4-bR is 2 x 10(-11) mol/L compared with 4 x 10(-12) mol/L for native ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A phase I dose escalation clinical trial was conducted in 25 patients with refractory B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-B4-bR was administered by daily 1-hour bolus infusion for 5 consecutive days at doses ranging from 1 microgram/kg/d to 60 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels above 1 nmol/L were achieved transiently in the majority of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose of 50 micrograms/kg/d for 5 days for a total dose of 250 micrograms/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose-limiting toxicity was defined by transient, reversible grade 3 elevations in hepatic transaminases, without impaired hepatic synthetic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor toxicities included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human antimouse antibody and human anti-ricin antibody were detected in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One complete response, two partial responses, and eight mixed or transient responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results show the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity of Anti-B4-bR and indicate that this immunotoxin can be administered as a daily bolus infusion for 5 days with tolerable, reversible toxicity </plain></SENT>
