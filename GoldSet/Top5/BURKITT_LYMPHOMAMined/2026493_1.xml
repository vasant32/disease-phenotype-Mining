<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have successfully synthesized a new N2S4 (compound 4) chelate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This chelate forms a stable complex with 99mTc and is capable of coupling to different proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The N2S4 compound is quite stable if kept as a <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> salt and is coupled to antibody under neutral conditions with better than 95% efficiency without the loss of immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
