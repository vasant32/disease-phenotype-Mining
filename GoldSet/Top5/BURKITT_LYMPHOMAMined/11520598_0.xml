<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not been widely investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the uptake and clearance characteristics of Tc-99m MIBI in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">thallium-201</z:chebi> (Tl-201) and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 (Ga-67) uptake and clearance characteristics were evaluated for comparison with Tc-99m MIBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (monocyte-like, histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, human; B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastoid, human; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, lymphoid, human) were selected by multistep <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> treatment up to 50 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation of the radiotracers, Tc-99m MIBI, Tl-201 and Ga-67, in medium for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 120 min, the uptake and clearance of each radiotracer were measured in the drug-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> expression was determined by immunohistochemical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a comparison of the three radiotracers, the uptake of Tc-99m MIBI was the greatest in the studied <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tc-99m MIBI uptake was much lower in drug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines than in non-resistant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the uptake characteristics of Tl-201 did not differ between drug-resistant and non-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry analyses of Ab-1 or JSB indicated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells expressed <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-1 protein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tc-99m MIBI is a good radiotracer for detecting drug resistance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
