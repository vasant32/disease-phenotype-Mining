<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To address the issue of salvageability in relapsed children with NHL who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received the same frontline therapy, we retrospectively studied the treatment response and the outcome of 27 children who relapsed following the CCLSG-NHL890 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reinduction rates and 3-year survival rates (mean +/- SD) were as follows: lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LB, n = 9), 44% &amp; 17 +/- 14%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> syndrome (LLS, n = 8), 25% &amp; 0%; large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LC, n = 3) 100% &amp; 67 +/- 27%; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B, n = 7) 0% &amp; 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the salvageability of LC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was good, but the outcome of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCLSG-NHL960 protocol for LB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and intensive multiagent regimens for LC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> produced favorable response rates, but the effect of the high-dose Ara-C regimen for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial stages of the disease seemed to be associated with the patient outcome: the outcome of the patients in stage IV was inferior to that of patients in stages II or III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other clinical variables, such as relapse sites, relapse time and BM rescue did not affect the patients' outcome </plain></SENT>
