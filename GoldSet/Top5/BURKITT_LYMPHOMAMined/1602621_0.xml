<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) was detected in the sera, although its activity was not detected in the supernate of the cultured lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymphoblasts stimulated production of IL-1 alpha from human umbilical endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the lymphoblasts infiltrating bone marrow may have stimulated production of IL-1 alpha from bone marrow stroma cells, and IL-1 alpha may have induced <z:mp ids='MP_0000322'>granulocytosis</z:mp> and a high level of CRP </plain></SENT>
