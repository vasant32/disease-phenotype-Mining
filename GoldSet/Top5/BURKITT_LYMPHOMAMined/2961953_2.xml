<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells had a mature T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (TdT-,CD3+,CD8+,CD4-) and were morphologically large granular lymphocytes and immunoblasts, both cell types with similar lysosomal granules in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and the T cell receptor beta chain gene were not rearranged, while the T cell receptor gamma chain gene was polyclonally rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mitoses were obtained only from spontaneously dividing cells in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>; 49 of the 50 metaphases analyzed were chromosomally abnormal and had a t(1;22)(q12;q13) and dup(1)(q31q32) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them; 48 metaphases had in addition a t(8;14)(q24;q32) which presumably arose during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter may be associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> of this T cell disorder by comparison with other proliferations of large granular lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although abnormalities involving 14q32 are characteristic of B cell disorders, they have also been described in T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, suggesting that genes transcribed in T cells and/or oncogenic sequences significant in T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are present in 14q32 </plain></SENT>
