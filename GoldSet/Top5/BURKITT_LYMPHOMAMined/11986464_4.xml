<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Minimal experience has been reported with DAH after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the incidence, management and outcome of DAH in a pediatric HCT population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of 138 patients undergoing allogeneic (n = 89) or autologous (n = 49) HCT at a referral children's medical center between January 1996 and April 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (5.1%) of 138 patients met criteria for DAH; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were allogeneic recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age of DAH patients was 11 years (range: 1.4-15.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of DAH following HCT was day 24 (range: 10-50), median day of engraftment day 20 and white blood cell count 0.54 x 10(9)/L (range: &lt; 0.1-7.03), with no difference between survivors and nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients developed clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and 6 required intubation, with PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were intubated a median of 12 days (range: 1-75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced &gt;1 episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and 3 patients required reintubation after successful extubation resulting from recurrent DAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures were negative for viruses, bacteria and fungi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DAH patients received steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients died with progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948755" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary failure</z:e> and other organ system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of 7 DAH patients (57%) survived to discharge, but 3 died from disease relapse at days 116, 138, and 273 post-HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DAH occurred more frequently in allogeneic HCT recipients compared with autologous recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of DAH coincided closely with white blood cell engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> and need for mechanical ventilation, HCT patients can survive DAH </plain></SENT>
