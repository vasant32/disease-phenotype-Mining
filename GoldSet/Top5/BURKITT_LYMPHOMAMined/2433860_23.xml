<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These constituted 14.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1974 and 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 22 years in these cases, 81.8% of which had extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the cells in the smears (59.8% +/- 8.32%) were in the 11 micron to 15 micron size range and 60.3% +/- 10.3% had noncleaved nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An average 71% of the cells contained cytoplasmic and/or nuclear vacuolizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonneoplastic macrophages were present in the smears in 87.5% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A study of paraffin-embedded sections in 17 cases revealed the characteristic "starry-sky" appearance in 11; in 5 it was not clearly appreciated and in 1 the nonneoplastic macrophages were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FNA cytology was found to be quite reliable for arriving at a diagnosis of Burkitt-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of the cases were managed without resort to subsequent surgical biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exploratory laparotomy was avoided in 69% of the cases having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
