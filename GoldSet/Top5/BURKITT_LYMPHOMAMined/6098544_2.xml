<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>P3HR-1 lymphoblasts were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in variable doses and durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The augmented expression of Ii, EBV antigens (EA and VCA), DNA synthesis, and cell growth and viability were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-Butyrate</z:chebi> induced hyperexpression of Ii at 2 days with a maximal effective dose of 4 mM, induced EBV antigens (EA and VCA) in 36 per cent of the cells at 2 days, inhibited DNA synthesis and cell growth, and was not cytolytic at 48 h when Ii induction was maximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> did not induce hyperexpression of Ii, induced EBV antigens (EA) in 30 per cent of the cells at 4 days, did not inhibit DNA synthesis and cell growth, and was not cytolytic in the time course and doses studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ii expression, therefore, did not appear to be an obligatory consequence of EBV antigen induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ii induction might be related to an effect of EBV inducers on cellular DNA synthesis, or on control of the cell cycle, or directly upon Ii gene regulation </plain></SENT>
