<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-10 was detected in 14 out of 19 cases with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, with higher values being observed in patients who had developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> within the first few months post-transplantation, and who had an aggressive form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of the 14 patients in whom IL-10 was detected had Epstein Barr virus-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And 11 out of 14 patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients who had detectable IL-10 at the time of diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the IL-10 had not been present previously, but it was found in the serum of 7 out of 9 dialysis patients, and in 8 out of 17 stable transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IL-10 plays a role in the development of the more severe forms of post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and may be secreted by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However. data from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> or patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy must be treated with caution </plain></SENT>
