<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have characterized several antigens differentially expressed in these 2 types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine whether use of these markers would aid in the differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> vs CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> by flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three cases of CD10+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with available cryopreserved samples were identified (13 BL and 10 CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiparameter FCI was performed using the following antibodies: CD18, CD20, CD43, CD44, and CD54 and isotype controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD44 and CD54 was detected at a significantly lower level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> compared with CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was not a significant difference in expression of CD18 and CD43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data show that expression of CD44 and CD54 differs significantly between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and CD10+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
