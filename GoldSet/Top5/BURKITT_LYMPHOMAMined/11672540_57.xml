<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the human lymphotropic herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcriptionally activates the env gene of an endogenous retrovirus, HERV-K18, that possesses SAg activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAg activity was demonstrated by MHC class II dependent preferential activation of TCRVB13 T cells in response to murine B cells transfected with the HERV-K18 env gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a unique demonstration of a pathogen inducing a host-encoded Sag and accounts for the previously described EBV associated Sag activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T cell activation elicited by the Sag could play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and associated diseases </plain></SENT>
