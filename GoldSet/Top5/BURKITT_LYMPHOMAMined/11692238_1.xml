<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the natural history of children with abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who had complete clinical remission and residual abdominal mass after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The charts and imaging findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated and followed at our medical center between 1988 and 1999 were reviewed for the presence, management, clinical course, and prognosis of residual mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only children who achieved complete clinical remission were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 33 children (20 boys and 13 girls) aged 2.6-17.6 years (mean 7.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven (20.6 %) were found to have a residual abdominal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two underwent second-look operation with no evidence of viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> on histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining five were followed by imaging studies for 2.2-9.1 years (mean 6.1 years); none relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Residual mass is not uncommon in children with abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of residual mass in a child with complete clinical remission does not alter the long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and residual mass with no other signs of disease activity, expectant watching may be appropriate </plain></SENT>
