<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The internalization and intracellular processing of monoclonal antibody to immunoglobulin mu heavy chain (Mamu) have been investigated in two human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (Ramos and Raji), in a human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human peripheral blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the degradation of 125I-labeled Mamu to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30956">trichloroacetic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) soluble material, a distinct pattern of larger 125I-Mamu fragments was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sources of B cells tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The particular fragmentation pattern, as revealed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoretic analysis, involved the cleavage of both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> bonds and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bridges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This type of antibody fragmentation appeared to be a selective mechanism associated with sIgM, as no other degradation than that leading to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-soluble material could be detected after the internalization and degradation of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies towards a variety of non-Ig B cell surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three fragments of 125I-Mamu degradation were also detected in the supernatant of Ramos cells, implying that the recycling and exocytosis of certain 125I-Mamu fragments also took place </plain></SENT>
