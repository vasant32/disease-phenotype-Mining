<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequent rearrangement of chromosome band 1q12 constitutive heterochromatin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> suggests that this rearrangement plays an important pathogenetic role in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oncogenic mechanisms linked to 1q12 heterochromatin are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Constitutive heterochromatin can epigenetically regulate gene function through the formation of transcriptional-silencing compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, as a first step toward understanding whether 1q12 rearrangements might compromise such activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, we investigated the 3-D organization of the 1q12 heterochromatin domain (1q12HcD) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, we showed that the 1q12HcD dynamically organizes to the nuclear periphery in response to B-cell receptor engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we observed an almost twofold increase in 1q12Hc domains at the extreme nuclear periphery in activated versus resting B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, 1q12Hc organization was noticeably altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells that showed structural alterations of 1q12; the 1q12Hc domains were significantly displaced from the extreme nuclear periphery compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activated B lymphocytes (P &gt; 0.0001), although overall peripheral localization was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a case in which there was a translocation of IGL enhancer to 1q, the altered nuclear positioning of the 1q12HcD was even more pronounced (5% of the 1q12Hc domains at the nuclear periphery compared to 20% in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines), and we were able to mimic this effect in two additional B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results point to the 1q12HcD having a specific, nonrandom, and regulated peripheral organization in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This organization is significantly disrupted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells harboring 1q rearrangements </plain></SENT>
