<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specimens with low percentages (0.05%-5%) of abnormal lymphoid populations were identified by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal lymphoid populations were sorted by flow cytometry, and the purified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> populations along with unsorted fractions were subsequently analyzed for the presence of clonal gene rearrangements by PCR and fluorescence-based capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 3 cases, distinct clonality profiles could be detected in the purified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell fraction, and suspicious amplicons of identical sizes were detected among the polyclonal backgrounds in the unsorted specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 1 patient, a monoclonal signal was detected in the sorted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell fraction but not in the unseparated bone marrow specimen containing 0.05% abnormal lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subsequent bone marrow specimen containing 4.8% recurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells tested positive with a clonality profile that matched the previous profile in the sorted cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The described method integrating 2 technologies allows genotypic confirmation of an aberrant population detected by immunophenotype to increase diagnostic certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This strategy provides a sensitive tool for disease monitoring without the need for patient-specific primer design and assay optimization required for quantitative PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
