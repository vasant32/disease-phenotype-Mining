<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using ChIP Seq, we identified 556 and 467 putative STAT6 target sites in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos and in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lung epithelial cell line BEAS2B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined the positions and expression of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in these cells using our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> Seq method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that 44 and 132 genes in Ramos and BEAS2B, respectively, had STAT6 binding sites in proximal regions of their previously reported TSSs that were up-regulated at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 406 and 109 of the STAT6 target sites in Ramos and BEAS2B, respectively, were located in proximal regions of previously uncharacterized TSSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The target genes identified in Ramos and BEAS2B cells in this study and in Th2 cells in previous studies rarely overlapped and differed in their identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, ChIP Seq analyses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II revealed that chromatin formed an active structure in regions surrounding the STAT6 binding sites; this event also frequently occurred in different cell types, although neither STAT6 binding nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TSS</z:e> induction was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rough landscape of STAT6-responsive sites was found to be shaped by chromatin structure, but distinct cellular responses were mainly mediated by distinct sets of transcription factors </plain></SENT>
