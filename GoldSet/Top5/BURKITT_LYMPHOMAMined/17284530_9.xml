<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proapoptotic function of p53 is thought to underlie most anticancer modalities and is also activated in response to oncogenic insults, such as overexpression of the Myc oncoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we generated tractable B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using retroviral transduction of the MYC oncogene into hematopoietic cells with 2 knock-in alleles encoding a fusion between p53 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) receptor (p53ER(TAM)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these polyclonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, Myc is the only oncogenic lesion, and p53ER(TAM) status can be rapidly toggled between "off" and "on" with 4OHT, provided that the Trp53 promoter has been independently activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although 4OHT can trigger widespread <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and overt <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> even in the absence of DNA-damaging agents, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with high levels of Mdm2 these responses are blunted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, cotreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> fully restores therapeutic effects in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 and overexpression of Hdm2 are highly sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi>, unless p53 levels are reduced using the HPV-E6 ubiquitin ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> could be highly effective as a monotherapy against Myc-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, with no need for adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, their efficacy is crucially dependent on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 status of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, placing important restrictions on patient selection </plain></SENT>
