<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fertilization of the mouse oocyte is followed by a remodelling of the actin and tubulin filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TRiC subunit TCP1 is expressed only from the 4-cell stage on, even though actin and tubulin are synthesized in the previous stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of synthesis of another subunit, TRiC-P5, during early mouse embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that TRiC-P5 is synthesized at the 2-cell stage in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37415">alpha-amanitin</z:chebi> sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is expressed before TCP1 and is one of the first proteins to be synthesized after zygotic genome activation </plain></SENT>
