<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from a association with two geographically-restricted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), EBV is thought to be implicated in the etiology of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in immunocompromised individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, monitoring the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load in serum can provide useful information on the timing of the instigation of antiviral therapy, i.e. as soon as a rise is detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PCR technology, owing to its high sensitivity, is used frequently in such situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to gain further insight into the nature of the peripheral blood cells carrying the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome on a cell-by-cell basis, an in situ amplification technique was developed as a model using two cell lines growing in suspension, with the aim of distinguishing between EBV-positive and EBV-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experiments were undertaken subsequently on clinical samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> indicating that this technique might be useful clinically </plain></SENT>
