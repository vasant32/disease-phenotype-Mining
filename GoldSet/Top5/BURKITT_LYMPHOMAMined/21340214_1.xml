<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analyses of diagnosed pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases in a 10-year period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We believe that it represents the largest series of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> presented from Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> represented 68% of the cases, including those of precursor (36%) and mature (64%) cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mature cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> comprised 81% of the B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and 19% of the T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> represented 32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, including 87% of the classical type and 13% of nodular lymphocyte predominant type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The geographic distribution showed 38.4% of the cases in the Southeast region, 28.7% in the Northeast, 16.1% in the South, 8.8% in the North, and 8% in the Central-west region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution by age groups was 15-18 years old, 33%; 11-14 years old, 26%; 6-10 years old, 24%; and 6 years old or younger, 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, most of the cases were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (65%), followed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mature T-cell group, anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ALK-positive was the most prevalent (57%), followed by peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, then not otherwise specified (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group of classic Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the main histological subtype was nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nodular lymphocyte predominance occurred more frequently than in other series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some of the results found in this study may reflect the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> socioeconomical status and environmental factors of the Brazilian population in different regions </plain></SENT>
