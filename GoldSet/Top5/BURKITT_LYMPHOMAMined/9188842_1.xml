<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the latter elements, the IgH 3' enhancer, is of particular interest: (1) it is B cell-specific and active only in late B cell development; (2) in rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and in some human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> it is part of a locus control region (LCR) that is involved in deregulation of the c-myc oncogene as a result of translocation into the IgH locus; and (3) it has been implicated in the mechanisms that control Ig gene class switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used a somatic cell hybridization approach to genetically analyse regulation of the activity of the IgH 3' enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When mouse MPC11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cells, in which the IgH 3' enhancer is active, are fused with fibroblasts, Ig expression is extinguished at the level of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that in a MPC11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> x fibroblast environment, the IgH 3' enhancer is transcriptionally inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that binding of several B cell-specific transcription factors, essential for IgH 3' enhancer activity, is lacking, which may explain 3' enhancer inactivity, although the binding of repressors cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the high expression level of c-myc, characteristic of the parental MPC11 cells carrying the t(12;15) translocation, is down-regulated in the hybrids to that in unfused fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inactivation of the IgH 3' enhancer is a multifactorial process affecting several transcription factors that control the cell-specific and developmental activity of the enhancer </plain></SENT>
