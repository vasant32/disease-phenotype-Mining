<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclic variations in the degree of P were found as a function of time after subculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The P value decreases within three hours, until a minimal value obtained before the phase of logarithmic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, P increases up to its presubculture value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of these variations is not correlated to the differentiation phenotype of the cell lines, nor to their pathologic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments with dialyzed or not depleted medium, show that these changes are seen only in the presence of fresh serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the P values vary with the ratio of serum concentration to cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These P value modulations are related to subsequent variations in proliferation rate, except in the immature non B-non T REH cells, which grow independently on the serum to cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that changes in the dynamic organization of membrane components are specific for each cell line and are controlled by serum factors </plain></SENT>
