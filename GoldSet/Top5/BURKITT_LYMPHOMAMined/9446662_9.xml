<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify novel antileukemic agents that can bypass the mechanisms of multidrug resistance, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> ([CyA] 5 mumol/L) produced a median cell kill of 69% (range, 47% to 85%) in seven B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell lines (OP-1, SUP-B15, KOPN-55bi, RS4;11, NALM6, REH, and 380) and three T-lineage ALL cell lines (MOLT4, CCRF-CEM, and CEM-C7) after 4 days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 10 mumol/L, median CyA toxicity was 99% (range, 88% to &gt; 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CyA was equally toxic to both a multidrug-resistant cell line, CEM-VLB100, which overexpresses gp-170 P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, and one resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi>, CEM-VM1-5, which has a mutation in the topoisomerase II gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CyA was also toxic to primary leukemic cells maintained in stroma-based culture, a system that substantially prolongs in vitro cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Against lymphoblasts from 21 patients with B-lineage ALL, the compound (at 5 mumol/L) reduced the leukemic cell number by a median of 87% (range, 27% to &gt; 99%) compared with results for parallel control cultures lacking CyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of these samples were from cases with unfavorable genetic features (e.g., Philadelphia-chromosome or MLL gene rearrangements); three were obtained at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Against T lymphoblasts (from six patients), the median reduction in cell number was 79% (range, 30% to &gt; 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 10 mumol/L, the cell kill exceeded 97% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of CyA cytotoxicity was found to be the activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> but not by inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-3 kinase activity, or tyrosine kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate high levels of CyA-induced toxicity against ALL cells at concentrations achievable in vivo, thus providing a strong rationale for clinical testing of this agent in patients with ALL </plain></SENT>
