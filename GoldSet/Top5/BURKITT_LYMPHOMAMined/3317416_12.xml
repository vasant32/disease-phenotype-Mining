<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both activated ras genes partially complemented the regulatory defect in RJ2.2.5 and specifically increased the expression of the DR and DQ subsets of HLA class II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blot-hybridization analysis and RNase mapping indicated that HLA-DQ alpha-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the infected cell lines was increased to a level at least 50% that of the parent B-cell line, Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of HLA-DR and -DQ beta-chain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> also were increased but to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we detected no effect of ras on the quantities of other class II, class I, or invariant-chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with antibodies recognizing HLA-DR, -DQ, and class I antigens supported these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of HLA class II gene expression by ras genes may have important implications for regulation of the immune system in response to transformation </plain></SENT>
