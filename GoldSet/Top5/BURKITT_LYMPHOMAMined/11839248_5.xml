<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>Necrosis</z:mp> Therapy (TNT) is an approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targeting that utilizes MAbs directed against common intracellular antigens such as nucleic acids, accessible only in necrotic areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By binding to the necrotic core of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, these TNT MAbs can circumvent many of the limitations of MAbs directed against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chimeric TNT-1 (chTNT-1) was first developed from the parent murine antibody by genetically engineering the murine variable regions to the human IgG(1) and kappa constant regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the chimeric antibody's behavior was similar to that of the murine version, the 35% murine homology it shares allows for the potential of a HAMA response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A human antibody derived from a phage display library, designated NHS76, has been developed with similar binding characteristics to the TNT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate that this genetically engineered human counterpart to chTNT-1 has similar pharmacokinetic characteristics, in vivo behavior, and targeting abilities, both antibodies were rigorously tested in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For these studies, biodistribution analysis in LS174T human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e>-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice was performed to compare the uptake levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, mouse imaging and autoradiographic studies were conducted to demonstrate positive uptake in necrotic regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and negative uptake in viable tissues and organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of these studies confirm the comparable nature of both antibodies and provide the necessary preclinical data to show the suitability of NHS76 as an improved product for the therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> in man </plain></SENT>
