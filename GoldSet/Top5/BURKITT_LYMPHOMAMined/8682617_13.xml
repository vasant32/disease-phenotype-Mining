<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we consider the possibility that EBNA-1, which is expressed in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, directly transactivates cell genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EBNA-1 protein was tested for transcription transactivation domains and the human genome was screened for high-affinity EBNA-1-binding sites that might mediate transactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None were found, although novel low-affinity-binding sites in the EBV genome were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the expression of BHRF1, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> homologue to bcl-2, in epithelial cells and showed that it is expressed in vivo in the EBV replication found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral hairy leukoplakia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A novel hypothesis is proposed for nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in which BHRF1 expression protects cells against apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by environmental DNA damaging agents and thus contributes to the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
