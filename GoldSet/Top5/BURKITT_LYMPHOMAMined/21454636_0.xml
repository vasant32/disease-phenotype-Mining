<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can immortalize B cells and contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that the ER Ca(2+) content of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines was increased following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with immortalization-competent virus expressing the full set of EBV latency genes (B95-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with an immortalization-deficient virus (P3HR-1) not expressing LMP-1 is without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMP-1 protein expression was sufficient to increase the ER Ca(2+) content and to increase the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this follow-up study, we showed that the resting [Ca(2+)](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>) of P3HR-1-infected cells was decreased, implying that EBV not only modified the ER homeostasis but also affected the cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even if the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) of these cells was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the [Ca(2+)](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>) increase after thapsigargin + CaCl(2) stimulation was blunted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the resting [Ca(2+)](<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>) of B95-8 infected cells was not changed, even if their SOCE was increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When expressed alone, LMP-1 induced an increase of the SOCE amplitude and the expression of the protein allowing this influx, Orai1, showing the effect of EBV on SOCE of B cells are mediated by LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, other hitherto unidentified EBV processes, unmasked in P3HR-1 infected cells, counteract this LMP-1-dependent increase of SOCE amplitude to impair a general and potentially toxic increase of [Ca(2+)](i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> modifies the cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis by acting on the ER and plasma membrane transporters </plain></SENT>
