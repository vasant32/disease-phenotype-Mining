<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cell line, i.e. the asparagine-dependent (Berkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22653">asparagin</z:chebi>-independent (human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovary cancer</z:e> cells) were used as the test-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of 3H-thimidine into DNA was the criterion of the preparation effect on the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preparation I with the specific activity of 60-90 IU per 1 mg of protein obtained at the first stages of purification had high non-specific cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preparation II obtained after further purification of preparation I, as well as preparation II without any stabilizer with the specific activity of 200 IU/mg were not inferior to the "Bayer" preparation by their biological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of L-asparaginase to the preparation as a stabilizer of excessive glycine (preparation IV) increased its non-specific cytotoxicity and interfered with the study of its properties in the cell systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> (preparation V) had no effect on the biological activity of L-asparaginase preparation </plain></SENT>
