<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies were positive for CMV DNA; two of them at 0.35 genome/cell and one at one copy 25% genome/cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CMV-related antigens, mainly localized in the nucleus, were found in cryostat sections of seven of 31 tumor biopsies and four of 12 KS cell lines at early passage level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It appears that the antigen is present in a high number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, like the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) in EBV-transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inevitably, the increasing data concerning the oncogenic potential of CMV lead on to consideration of the increasing evidence of its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>, a multiple hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> with an epidemiologic distribution in Africa similar to that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
