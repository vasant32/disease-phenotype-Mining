<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A newly isolated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, ROS-1, carrying the specific translocation (8;14) has been studied using somatic cell hybridization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As in other reported Burkitt cell lines, the oncogene c-myc was found to be translocated from the 8q- to the 14q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other reports, expression of the mu immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain correlated with the presence of the 14q+ derivative and not of its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the translocation (8;14) is not necessarily an abortive event for the production of the mu Ig heavy chain by the 14q+ derivative </plain></SENT>
