<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> incidence was generally low in PNG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this period, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of oral cavity, cervix, breast, and skin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were the most common types of malignant lesions detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the oral cavity has increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, it is more common in the Highlands region and is associated with the spread of betel nut chewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A threefold increase in cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> registration was observed nationally, with a sixfold increase in the Highlands region; this was attributed both to social changes and improved registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> has doubled, in keeping with better registration, but there is little interregional variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decline in registrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> is artifactual </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A decline in the incidence of squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of skin was observed that was associated with improved control of tropical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
