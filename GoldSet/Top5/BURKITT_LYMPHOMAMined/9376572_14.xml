<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in children with poor-prognosis Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> BMT registry was critically reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between February 1979 and July 1991, a selected group of 89 children (78 boys and 11 girls) were considered as ABMT candidates in 12 European <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers for the following reasons: poor initial response (PIR) to first-line chemotherapy in 28 patients, primary refractory disease (PRD) in nine patients, sensitive relapse (SR) in 38 patients, and resistant relapse (RR) in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age at ABMT was 8.2 years (range, 2.8 to 16.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, this report reflects data for patients surviving the salvage attempt deemed appropriate for HDC/ABMT and who then actually underwent the transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period after HDC/ABMT was 4.3 years (range, 2 to 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was dismal for PRD patients and those with RR, ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients died within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 56.6% (P &lt; .0001) for patients in partial remission (PR) and 48.7% (P = .002) for patients with SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous complete remissions (CRs) in 39.4% of these otherwise incurable children highlight the fact that HDC/ABMT was an effective complementary procedure after conventional-dose chemotherapy protocols used during the given period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these data show that patients with PRD or RR clearly had no advantage from this aggressive and cost-intensive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has to be considered that the need for HDC/ABMT has greatly diminished in parallel with the improvement in survival using the modern intensive pulsed CCT of current protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To further rescue patients failing to respond to modern protocols, new approaches appear necessary, ie, combinations of HDC with antibody-targeted therapy plus allogeneic BMT for the additional benefits of the potential graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
