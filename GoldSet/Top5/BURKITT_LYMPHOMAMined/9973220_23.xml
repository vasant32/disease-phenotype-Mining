<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the Fas-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> pathway in a panel of 11 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative and 10 EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that the increased expression of Fas in EBV-positive cell lines is mediated via LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the 21 BL cell lines are readily responsive to Fas-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 17 cell lines, 10 can be sensitized by up-regulating Fas either via exogenous expression of LMP-1 or via treatment with CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These same cell lines can also be sensitized by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (CHX), which, however, does not result in up-regulation of Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither up-regulation of Fas, nor treatment with CHX, restore Fas sensitivity in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analyses indicated that 5 of the 7 cell lines (and none of the 14 responsive cell lines) were also compromised in the integrity/expression of the proapoptotic gene Bax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, the Fas pathway seems to be inhibited, although the mechanism of inhibition varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between Bax mutation and irreversible (by CD40L or CHX) Fas resistance raises the possibility, for the first time, that Bax may play a critical function in Fas-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
