<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was in complete remission till he presented in 2002 with extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the parotid gland for which he underwent superficial parotidectomy and radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He continued in remission till 2006 when he presented with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and tamponade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At median sternotomy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> was drained, an anterior pericardiectomy was done and a left posterior pericardial window made, and an enlarged hard paraaortic lymph node excised </plain></SENT>
