<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 9,009 cases, 8,572 were of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), of which 67% were of B-cell type and 28.5% were of T-cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the NHL, 5.2% showed a follicular pattern, and 30.1% were extranodal upon presentation, the most frequent site being Waldeyer's ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> accounted for 7.9% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the regions where the cases of this disease were included in the review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within China, there was a higher incidence of B-cell types in the middle and western parts of the country as well as in Hainan Island (around 83%), while the T-cell types showed a higher incidence (34-45%) in the eastern part (Nanjing, Suzhou-Wuxi and Hangzhou) </plain></SENT>
