<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blast cells were analyzed in a group of 156 patients with different immunological subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, both lymphoblastic and myeloblastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 58 patients for whom immunologic studies were performed at relapse, 42 (72%) showed changes in the expression of immunologic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The minor shifts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> were observed most frequently and concerned of the loss of CD34 antigen in 17 cases and the loss of cALLA (CD10) in 7 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> at the first relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of cell markers was not frequently observed, only in four cases could be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR molecules remained relatively constant from diagnosis to relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 from 3 T-ALL cases the loss of CD1 and CD2 markers, respectively, was noticed at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD5 and CD7 markers were relatively stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases at relapse the acquisition of CD13 marker (in 4 from 7 cases) was often observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was interesting that comparing to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases, the loss of CD34 marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases was stray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case the acquisition of this antigen at relapse was actually observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major interlineage shift was detected in one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, that was newly diagnosed at relapse as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M4 and presented different cytogenetic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case provides strong connection with the treatment, as more recently epipodophyllotoxins (vumon in our patient) have been linked to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280449" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary AML</z:e> associated with a shorter latency period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic changes frequently occur at relapse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The shifts (loss or acquisition) in expression of individual markers at relapse are bound with the first diagnosis and may have a relationship to the treatment and are important for correct assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
