<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulation of transcription of eukaryotic genes is to a large extent combinatorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used an in silico approach to identify transcription factors (TFs) that form recurring regulatory modules with c-Myc, a protein encoded by an oncogene that is frequently disregulated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent study identified, on a genomic scale, human genes whose promoters are bound by c-Myc and its heterodimer partner Max in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using computational methods, we identified nine TFs whose binding-site signatures are highly overrepresented in this promoter set of c-Myc targets, pointing to possible functional links between these TFs and c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding sites of most of these TFs are also enriched on the set of mouse homolog promoters, suggesting functional conservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the enriched TFs, there are several regulators known to control cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another TF in this set, EGR-1, is rapidly activated by numerous stress challenges and plays a central role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental investigation confirmed that c-Myc and EGR-1 bind together on several target promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The approach applied here is general and demonstrates how computational analysis of functional genomics experiments can identify novel modules in complex networks of transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
