<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its cytotoxic effect was tested using human primary fibroblasts (FS4), a permanent, non-tumorgenic cell line derived from baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) and a tumorgenic lymphoid cell line derived from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BJA-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic action was in the range 2-50 micrograms/ml depending on the cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ED50 values, estimated on the basis of fmol ajoene/cell, revealed slightly higher doses for the primary cell (FS4) than the permanent line (BHK), whereas the tumorgenic BJA-B cells were most sensitive </plain></SENT>
