<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The attempt to demonstrate the genomic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> of the HSV 2 in cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the cervix by experiments of hybridization is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The investigations were carried out directly on material from <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the cervix and also on cell cultures from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the cultures grew fibroblasts but some cultures grew cells with the characteristics of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hybridization of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> from portions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> or of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> from cell cultures with complementary HSV 2 radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33697">RNS</z:chebi> showed in no case HSV-2-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> in a quantity of one or one half genomic equivalent per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These investigations suggest that a casual relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the uterine cervix and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with HSV 2 is unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it cannot be excluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the uterine cervix has different quantitative proportions than the Burkitt-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and that only a fraction of the genomic material of the virus (smaller than 1/10) is incorporated into the malignant cell </plain></SENT>
