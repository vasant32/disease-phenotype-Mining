<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its clinical significance, the molecular basis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistance in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently developed a highly clinically relevant experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, in which primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> biopsies were established as xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vivo and in vitro responses of a panel of these xenografts to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, reflected the outcome of the patients from whom they were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistance in B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL xenografts was not due to down-regulation of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (GR) nor to defective ligand binding of the GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-induced GR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistance was associated with profoundly attenuated induction of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only proapoptotic protein, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi>, when xenograft cells were exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> resistance in BCP ALL xenografts occurs downstream of ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the GR, but upstream of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33173">Bim</z:chebi> induction </plain></SENT>
