<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An HIV epidemic has been prevalent in Zambia since 1983-1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of the epidemic on the epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in children a retrospective study was undertaken at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the histopathological records from 1980 to 1992 were reviewed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in children less than 14 years of age were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to define the effect of the HIV epidemic, the epidemiological features of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> occurring before (during the years 1980-1982) and after (during the years 1990-1992) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the HIV epidemic were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the occurrence of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is mostly due to a highly significant increase in the incidence of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (p = 0.000016), which is causally related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, and a significant increase in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), which has an unknown relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though not yet statistically significant, there has also been a gradual and sustained increase in the incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A prospective in depth epidemiological study of HIV related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> in Africa is urgently needed </plain></SENT>
