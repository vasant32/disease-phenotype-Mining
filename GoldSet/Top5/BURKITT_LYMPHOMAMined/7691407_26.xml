<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>LL2 is a murine monoclonal antibody IgG2a reactive with B cells and non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which, in a radioiodinated form, induces responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients [Goldenberg et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1991) J Clin Oncol 9:548-564] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we identify LL2 as a member of the CD22 cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular size of the antigen, its expression profile, and competitive blocking studies were used to establish this identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation studies using the Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line metabolically labelled with [3H]leucine, the LL2 antigen was determined to correspond to a molecular mass of 140 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular mass of the LL2 antigen, and the B-cell-restricted reactivity of the LL2 antibody, were consistent with both the CD21 and CD22 clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess additional similarities and differences between LL2 and anti-CD22 and anti-CD21, the binding of these mAb to cultured cell lines, Nalm-6 and Molt-4, was compared by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The binding profile of LL2 on these cell lines was consistent with anti-CD22, but not anti-CD21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential immunoprecipitation and cross-blocking studies with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies recognizing established CD22 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were performed to confirm that LL2 reacts with CD22 and to determine which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> LL2 recognizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Binding of 131I-LL2 to Raji cells is inhibited over 90% by prior incubation of the target cells with unlabelled RFB4, indicating that LL2 belongs to the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> group as RFB4, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> B </plain></SENT>
