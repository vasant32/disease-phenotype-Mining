<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Here, we report results of an on-going study at four pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are tested routinely for HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) for the prevalence of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and center) for the children infected with HIV using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and non-malignant conditions, but not infected with HIV, as a comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 882 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, 38 were HIV infected (for 12 the HIV status was unknown) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HIV was associated with Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 cases were HIV infected; P &lt; 0.001) and with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 46.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-130.3; 13/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), 2/39 were HIV infected (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 0.9-27.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type was significantly associated with HIV, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo> (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.04-2.9; 1/172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> although results for non-Burkitt NHL were suggestive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, we did not identify an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with HIV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemias</z:hpo>, for which an underlying infectious etiology has been suggested </plain></SENT>
