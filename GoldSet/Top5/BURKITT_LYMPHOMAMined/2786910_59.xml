<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the genetic basis for natural anti-DNA immune responses, we isolated and sequenced the variable gene elements (VH and VL) encoding an anti-DNA antibody expressed by a human hybridoma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin (Kim4.6) and compared these sequences with those reported for four other human anti-DNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Kim4.6 antibody leader and VH segments were identical in nucleotide sequence with the VH1.9III germ-line VH3 gene, and the Kim4.6VL segment showed 98% nucleotide sequence identity with a V lambda I subgroup gene expressed in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of Kim4.6 and other human hybridoma anti-DNA antibodies indicated that anti-DNA immune responses are diverse in terms of VH and VL gene utilization but may exhibit a bias toward rearrangement of VH genes that are over-represented in the fetal pre-B cell repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Kim4.6 and three of four other sequenced human anti-DNA antibodies appear to use a germ-line diversity gene, DXP'1, which may represent a counterpart of the DFL16.1 segment utilized in murine responses to the hapten nitrophenyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our findings indicate that anti-DNA immune responses can be encoded by nonmutated VH genes and that the elements and molecular mechanisms which engender this response are essentially the same among natural and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-associated anti-DNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that natural <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp> originate early in B cell ontogeny as is consistent with the hypothesis that autoreactivity plays a major role in shaping the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune repertoire </plain></SENT>
