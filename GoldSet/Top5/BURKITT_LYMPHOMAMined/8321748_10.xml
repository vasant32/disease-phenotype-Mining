<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of the microtubule disrupting drugs (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) vinblastine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BM 13674, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve hours after administration of vinblastine (10(-3) mg/ml), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (10(-2) mg/ml) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (10(-2) mg/ml), cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with the characteristic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in 71.6%, 82.2% and 76.9% of the cells respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was confirmed as apoptotic by the occurrence of internucleosomal DNA cleavage, which was demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of casting light on the mechanism involved, inhibition tests were performed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by one of these drugs, vinblastine, using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35176">zinc sulphate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>, an activator of protein kinase C, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35176">zinc sulphate</z:chebi>, a putative inhibitor of the endonuclease were thought to be responsible for internucleosomal DNA cleavage; both markedly reduced the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi>, on the other hand, had no inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> treatment per se enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that new protein synthesis is not required for the execution of vinblastine-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a finding is in accord with recent reports suggesting that the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> program" within many cell types may be primed but unable to proceed due to concomitant production of specific "apoptotic inhibitors" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> prevent vinblastine-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the BM 13674 cells by activating one or more of these specific "apoptotic inhibitors", possibly by means of PKC-mediated phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
