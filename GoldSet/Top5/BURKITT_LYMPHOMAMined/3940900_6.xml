<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On this basis a new approach to studies of ligand-receptor binding is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the interaction of the ricin B-chain with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as an example and fluorescent labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> as a probe, the ligand-induced changes of fluorescence anisotropy were shown to be concentration-dependent and to permit determination of the binding constant and the number of receptor-binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method was found to be specific and highly sensitive, allowing detection of the action of one RB molecule per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-RB demonstrated the presence on the cell surface of two binding sites with Kd approximately 10(-10) and approximately 10(-8) M, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only the high-affinity sites were detected by the fluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Saturation of these sites resulted in maximum inhibition of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
