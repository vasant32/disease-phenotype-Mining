<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology (FNAC) is a technique that can overcome tissue-sampling disaggregation problems related to DNA flow cytometry analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study, with long-term follow-up (median, 72 mo), was to investigate the prognostic value of DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and additionally, the relevance of SPF in the grading of NHLs, using FNAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The series comprised 76 patients with NHL (32 indolent and 44 aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including 14 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) and 30 patients with reactive lymph node enlargement used as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA flow cytometry was performed on fresh samples obtained by FNAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL grading was done according to the updated Kiel classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-yr overall survival of patients with NHL was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples of the control group and 81.6% of the NHLs showed a DNA diploid pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cases (18.4%) were DNA aneuploid with bimodal distribution: slight hyperdiploidy and near-tetraploidy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in aggressive than in indolent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (22.7% vs. 12.5%), no correlation between DNA ploidy and NHL grading was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SPF revealed a strong correlation with grading (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean SPF values varied from 6.5% in indolent NHLs, to 20.4% in aggressive not-otherwise-specified (NOS) NHLs, and to 35.3% in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aggressive NHLs had an SPF &gt;15%, while the vast majority of indolent NHLs showed an SPF &lt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean SPF value in the reactive node group was 6.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NHL grading significantly was correlated to survival (P=0.004) only if the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which showed the best prognosis, were analyzed as an independent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a trend that did not reach statistical significance (P=0.072) for a worse clinical outcome of patients with aneuploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When mean SPF values were used as cutoff points to divide both indolent NHLs and aggressive NOS NHLs into two proliferative subgroups, no differences in relation to survival were found (P=0.763 and P=0.994, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Also, no proliferative difference was verified between indolent NHLs and the reactive lymph node group (P=0.223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These results show that flow cytometric SPF is a valuable complementary parameter for grading NHLs on FNAC samples, but it appears to give no additional prognostic information on subset analyses </plain></SENT>
