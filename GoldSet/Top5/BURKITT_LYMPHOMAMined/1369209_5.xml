<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two immunoglobulin production stimulating factors (IPSF) have been found in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One IPSF named IPSF-II alpha was purified and identified as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here purification, identification and characterization of IPSF-II beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IPSF-II beta was purified by the serial use of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> fractionation, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-exchange column chromatography and gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IPSF-II beta was estimated as a 46 KD monomeric <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> by gel filtration and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial amino acid sequence of the 46 KD protein was analyzed for 26 amino acid residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence very closely coincided with enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) derived from various origins and, it was completely homologous with that of human enolase alpha-chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rabbit muscle enolase stimulated IgM production of hybridoma lines, and IPSF-II beta had the enzymic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that IPSF-II beta was alpha-enolase or its isozyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IPSF activities of IPSF-II beta was stable in alkaline conditions whereas the enzymic activity was rapidly lost in alkaline conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Though IPSF-II beta stimulated IgM production of both human-human and mouse-mouse hybridoma lines in serum-free condition, it partially suppressed IgE production of mouse-mouse hybridoma lines </plain></SENT>
