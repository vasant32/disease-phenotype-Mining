<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results show that at 31.2 J/cm2 of laser light in the presence of 20 micrograms/mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52129">merocyanine 540</z:chebi> (MC540) there was greater than 5 log reduction in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Daudi) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell kill was obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) cells at a laser light dose of 93.6 J/cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, to obtain the same efficiency of killing for histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (U-937) cells, a higher dose of MC540 (25 micrograms/mL) was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cell colony formation was reduced by greater than 5 logs after laser photoradiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under identical conditions for each cell line the percent survival for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM, 45.9%, 40%, 17.5%), granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte (GEMM, 40.1%, 20.1%, 11.5%), colony-forming units (CFU-C, 16.2%, 9.1%, 1.8%), and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E, 33.4%, 17.8%, 3.9%) was significantly higher than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mixing of gamma ray-irradiated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (1:1 and 10:1 ratio) did not interfere with the elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of highly purified recombinant interferon alpha (rIFN) on laser photoradiation therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of rIFN (30 to 3,000 U/mL), the viability of leukemic cells was observed to increase from 0% to 1.5% with a concurrent decrease in membrane polarization, suggesting an increase in fluidity of cell membrane in response to rIFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at higher doses of rIFN (6,000 to 12,000 U/mL) this phenomenon was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The viability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells remained unaffected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses of rIFN tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may have therapeutic relevance in patients undergoing interferon treatment who require bone marrow transplantation, as the complete elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells by marrow-purging procedures may be hampered by this increased survival in the presence of interferon </plain></SENT>
