<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were grafted in 1st complete remission (CR) either because of long delay to achieve CR or as consolidation in those with initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
