<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Working with a cloned cDNA probe (lambda hTGF1-10) and derivatives, we have mapped this gene (TGFA) to 2p13 with the use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the same region involved in the 2;8 translocations of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a rearrangement could orient c-myc (8q24) adjacent to TGFA, resulting in activation of one or both of these genes </plain></SENT>
