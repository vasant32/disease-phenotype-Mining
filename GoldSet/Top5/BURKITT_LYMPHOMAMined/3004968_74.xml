<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cell lines only aberrant c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BL67 cells contain two c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species of 2.4 and 3.5 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2.4-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is initiated at several cryptic promoters in the first intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3.5-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is transcribed from the immunoglobulin heavy chain anti-sense strand across the breakpoint of the translocation into the first exon of the c-myc gene and is then normally spliced using the physiological splice donor and acceptor sites of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BL18 contains c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of 2.4 kb initiated at cryptic promoters in the first intron and additional <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of 0.90 kb and 0.74 kb transcribed from the dual c-myc promoters on the reciprocal fragment of the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic turnover of these <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> differs significantly from that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc message </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3.5-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of BL67 cells and the 0.90-kb and 0.74-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of BL18 cells, which are both hybrid molecules consisting of c-myc and immunoglobulin sequences, have a half-life of several hours in contrast to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc message with a half-life of 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aberrant 2.4-kb c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of BL67 and BL18 cells are also more stable than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc message and disappear with a half-life of 50 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
