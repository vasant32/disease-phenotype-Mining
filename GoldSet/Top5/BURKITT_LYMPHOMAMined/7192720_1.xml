<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three thymic hormonal preparations (thymopoietin, thymic humoral factor and TP-1) were tested by this assay and found to have a significant enhancing effect on the blastogenic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Essential for the demonstration of the hormonal effect was the selection of suboptimal stimulation conditions, with the appropriate cell lines, including the number of stimulating cells and the time in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most reproducible results were achieved when 1 x 10(5) PBL were co-cultured for 4 days with 1 x 10(4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi> treated Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, after 1 h preincubation with one of the thymic preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, strong enhancing effects of the thymic preparations could also be demonstrated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cel lines, especially IgR3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
