<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include changes to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> gene and to the genes that regulate its phosphorylation, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRb) is associated with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>pRb is expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells and its regulatory phosphorylation pathway is activated in response to a variety of stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines are often used as in vitro model systems to analyse the downstream effects of signal transduction, we examined the functional status of pRb in a panel of human B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified eleven cell lines which express the hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we suggest that the pRb protein appears to be functional in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
