<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is associated with many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, EBV is one of the most extensively studied herpesviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a putative G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) gene of EBV, BILF1, has hitherto escaped attention, yet BILF1-like genes are conserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known lymphocryptovirus species, suggesting that they play a pivotal role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the function of EBV BILF1, the activity of this gene and its products was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BILF1-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in various EBV-positive cell types and found to be expressed predominantly during the immediate early and early phases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in COS-7 cells transfected with BILF1 expression constructs, a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-induced CRE-mediated transcription was measured, as well as an increase in NF-kappaB-mediated transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CRE-mediated transcription was increased in EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as well as EBV-positive lymphoblastoid B cells transfected with BILF1, whereas NF-kappaB-mediated transcription levels remained unaffected in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> observed activities were sensitive to treatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pertussis</z:e> toxin, indicating that the BILF1-encoded protein mediates these activities by coupling to G proteins of the G(i/o) class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, reduced levels of phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-dependent antiviral protein kinase were observed in COS-7 and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells transfected with BILF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither of the observed effects required a ligand to interact with the BILF1 gene product, suggesting that BILF1 encodes a constitutively active GPCR capable of modulating various intracellular signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
