<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remission duration in both groups were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complement-dependent cytotoxic antibody was seen in 5 of 8 immunized patients and 0 of 8 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antibody reacted with RAJI and both allogeneic and autologous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody titers began to rise after 2 months, peaked at 4 months, and then declined prior to relapse in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time course of the increase in mixed-leukocyte culture response to RAJI was similar to immunized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased in vitro response to phytohemagglutinin was seen during drug administration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no clinical benefit was seen in this small number of patients with the RAJI injections, these in vitro responses are encouraging and new immunization schedules will be investigated </plain></SENT>
