<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the few cell lines with the variant translocations t(2;8) and t(8;22) reported to date, the breakpoints on chromosome 8 were located downstream of MYC at a distance of up to 300 kb and more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe three new cases with variant translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> material from paediatric patients, negative for the common translocation t(8;14), was analysed using a long-distance (LD) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On chromosome 8, primers were derived from several different regions 3' of MYC, and on chromosomes 2 and 22 from the constant regions of the Ig kappa (Igkappa) and lambda (Iglambda) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One translocation t(2;8) and two t(8;22) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the t(2;8) translocation, the chromosome 8 breakpoint was located 2 kb 3' of the MYC exon 3 and the chromosome 2 breakpoint within an unrearranged Igkappa locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints of the two translocations t(8;22) were detected 16 kb for one and 58 kb for the other downstream of MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequencing the t(8;22) translocation in one of the cases showed hypermutation of the translocated variable Vlambda4b gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of hypermutated variable regions in the t(8;22) case suggests germinal centre B cells as the origin of this translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The t(2;8) translocation is the first description of a translocation t(2;8) involving an unrearranged Igkappa gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A mechanism different from V-J recombination and somatic hypermutation has to be proposed for this translocation </plain></SENT>
