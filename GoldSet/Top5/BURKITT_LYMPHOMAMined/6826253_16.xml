<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As early as 12 h after application of the drug, an increase of EA-positive cells can be seen, the maximum induction being reached after 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nanogram amounts per ml of hormone are sufficient for measurable effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early antigen induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> does not require replication of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> differs from induction by other systems in two major respects: (1) it does not cooperate with other inducers, and (2) it is specifically inhibited by 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, however, shares at least one <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>-sensitive step with induction by chemicals such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2-deoxyuridine (IdUrd), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi> (n-BA) or inducing serum factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study defines three qualitatively different effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> in Daudi cells: an inhibitory effect on EBV induction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and two differential types of synergistic effects with serum factor or n-BA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this particular cell line, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> exhibits no inducing capacity when applied alone </plain></SENT>
