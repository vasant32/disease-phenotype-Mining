<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although TP53 inhibits the persistence of DSBs and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to protect cells from genomic instability and transformation, the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002020'>spontaneous tumors</z:mp> harboring clonal translocations has not been reported in mice that only lack <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Tp53 protein or express Tp53 mutants </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As somatic rather than germline inactivating mutations of TP53 are typically associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and Tp53 deletion has cellular context dependent effects upon lymphocyte transformation, we generated mice with conditional Tp53 deletion in lineage-committed B lymphocytes to avoid complications associated with defective Tp53 responses during embryogenesis and/or in multi-lineage potential cells and, thereby, directly evaluate the potential physiological role of Tp53 in suppressing translocations in differentiated cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that Tp53 serves critical functions in B lineage lymphocytes to prevent transformation caused by translocations in cell populations experiencing physiological levels of RAG/AID-initiated DSB intermediates, and provide evidence that the somatic TP53 mutations found in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may contribute to the development of these human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
