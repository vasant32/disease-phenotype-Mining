<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, it is demonstrated that silencing of LMP2B in EBV-harbouring Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Akata cells results in reduced expression of EBV immediate-early lytic BZLF1 gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and late lytic gp350/220 protein upon BCR cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, reduction of lytic EBV activation was observed in Akata cells overexpressing LMP2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, silencing of LMP2A expression resulted in higher lytic EBV <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in BCR cross-linked Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate a role for LMP2B distinct from that of LMP2A in regulation of lytic EBV activation in the host cell and support the hypothesis that LMP2B exhibits a negative-regulatory effect on the ability of LMP2A to maintain EBV latency by preventing the switch to lytic replication </plain></SENT>
