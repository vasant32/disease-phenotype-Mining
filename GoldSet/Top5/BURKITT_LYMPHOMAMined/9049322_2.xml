<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) is essential for EBV-induced immortalization of human primary B cells, transforms rodent fibroblasts and induces the up-regulation of several B cell activation markers when transiently expressed in primary B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biochemical function of LMP-1 is unclear and limited information is available on the involvement of different domains of the protein in B cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the characterization of LMP-1 N- and C-terminal deletion mutants in terms of their cell surface distribution and ability to induce activation markers in primary human B cells and in the type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DG75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal deletion mutant was detected by immunofluorescence via antibodies targeted against an eight amino acid FLAG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> substituted for the entire predicted cytoplasmic C-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that N-terminal deletion mutants of LMP-1 are unable to attain their usual patched distribution on the plasma membrane but retain the ability to activate B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the C-terminal deletion mutant shows the same patched cell surface distribution as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LMP-1 but is unable to activate B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patched distribution of LMP-1 in the plasma membrane is therefore not sufficient nor necessary for the induction of B cell activation and the results rule out patching as a direct mechanism in LMP-1-induced activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first study addressing the role of the LMP-1 C-terminal domain in lymphocytes and our results show that this domain is essential for B cell activation and therefore likely to be important for the early events of B cell immortalization by EBV </plain></SENT>
