<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the K562 line elaborated material which effectively suppressed the response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood lymphocytes to the T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> phytohemagglutinin and concanaval in A as well as the mixed lymphocyte reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little or no suppressive activity was evident when supernatants from Daudi or NALM-1 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a recent report [29] indicates that K562 does not inhibit the induction of immunoglobulin synthesis of B lymphocytes by pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings are discussed in the context of the immunosuppression associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and the apparent selective inhibition of different lymphocyte functions by material elaborated by different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
