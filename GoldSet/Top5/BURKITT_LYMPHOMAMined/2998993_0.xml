<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cells from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and from the majority of human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> show karyotypic changes that characteristically involve chromosomal breakage and recombination in addition to some chromosome gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These aberrations increase as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> progress in vivo, and a similar tendency is seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived lymphoid lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid lines of non-malignant origin also develop karyotypic abnormalities on prolonged culture, but these are predominantly nonrandom gains of whole chromosomes (i.e., non-disjunction events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They have never been observed to acquire the 8;14 translocation, which is an almost constant feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is some concordance between the pattern of chromosome gains found in long-term cultured lymphoblastoid lines and that seen in direct preparations from B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the lymphoblastoid lines that have become aneuploid are tumorigenic in immunosuppressed mice, indicating that EBV-transformed human B cells can acquire a malignant phenotype in the absence of specific chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the predominance of chromosomal breakage and recombination events in the karyotypic evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and other lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> comes about because <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> (which varies within a population) is a major risk factor for lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, interacting with other risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005435'>impaired T-cell function</z:hpo> and EBV to determine the clinical and epidemiological patterns of BI and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
