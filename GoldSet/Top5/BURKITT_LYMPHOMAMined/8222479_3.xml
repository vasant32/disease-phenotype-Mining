<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> clearance for course 1 (151 ml/min per 1.73 m2;) was not significantly different from clearance for course 2 (144 ml/min per 1.73 m2; p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median glomerular filtration rate measured before (159 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and after course 1 (161 ml/min per 1.73 m2) did not differ significantly (p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding was time dependent but modest with a median free fraction at the end of infusion of 0.82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic parameters for continuous-infusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> are similar to those reported for short infusions, but the median dose of 817 mg/m2 required to achieve an acceptable systemic exposure in these patients was 45% greater than the previously suggested maximum tolerated dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous infusion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> did not alter <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> clearance or adversely effect glomerular filtration rate during a second course, showing the feasibility of this alternative dosage strategy to enhance therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
