<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome-positive</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (Ph(+) ALL) have poor prognosis despite intensive therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>, a BCR-ABL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, has been proven to be an effective treatment for Ph(+) ALL, but nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients rapidly acquire resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> administration might overcome this resistance; however, systemic toxicities would likely limit this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a new delivery system allowing for the specific targeting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> is urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ph(+) ALL cells express CD19 on their surface, we have developed an immunoliposome carrying anti-CD19 antibody (CD19-liposomes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internalization efficiency of the CD19-liposomes approached 100% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ph(+) ALL cells but was very low in CD19(-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytocidal effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-encapsulated CD19-liposomes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-CD19-liposomes) on Ph(+) ALL cell lines and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells from patients with Ph(+) ALL was much greater than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> with or without control liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-CD19-liposomes did not affect the colony formation of CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, even at inhibitory concentration of free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi>-CD19-liposomes induced specific and efficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of Ph(+) ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This new therapeutic approach might be a useful treatment for Ph(+) ALL with fewer side effects than free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
