<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potential link between <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> and growth may involve the action of an oncogene c-myc which is thought to transcriptionally regulate <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the involvement of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> in anti-IgM-induced growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) completely blocked <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity, resulting in growth inhibition but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, the product of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> enzymatic action, to Ramos cells had only a minor effect on growth, did not cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, did not augment or block anti-IgM-mediated growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but did reverse DFMO-mediated growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgM treatment of Ramos cells, which markedly decreased c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, caused a paradoxical increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> enzymatic activity and increased cellular levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DFMO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> did not alter c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels directly, nor did they have any affects on anti-IgM-mediated down-regulation of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, which inhibited anti-IgM-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, did not inhibit either anti-IgM or DFMO-mediated inhibition of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These agents were without effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity itself or on the anti-IgM-mediated increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these studies we conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> inhibition affects growth but is unrelated to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both anti-IgM-mediated inhibition of growth and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus two distinct pathways for growth regulation are present: one in which <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> are important and the other cell surface receptor-mediated (sIg) which is independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
