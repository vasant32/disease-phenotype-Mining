<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of membrane IgM (mIgM) induced an increase in intracellular free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> as a result of the release from intracellular stores and an influx of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the B cells were incubated with limiting concentrations of anti-IgM, co-ligation of mIgM and CD54, but not CD19, resulted in an inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Separate cross-linking of mIgM and CD54 under these conditions, using isotype mismatched monoclonal antibodies (mAb), did not affect the mobilization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD54-mediated inhibition of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response was also observed in the absence of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CD54 mAb tested (F10.2, F10.3 and F7.11) interfered with mIgM signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this report imply that CD54 is linked to intracellular signaling pathways and, via co-ligation with mIgM, interferes in the release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> from intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
