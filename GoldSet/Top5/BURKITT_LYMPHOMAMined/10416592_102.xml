<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The p73 gene is located on 1p36.2-3, a region that is frequently deleted in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because p73 encodes for a protein that is both structurally and functionally homologous to the p53 protein, p73 has been postulated to be a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, however, mutations of p73 have not been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study methylation of the p73 5'CpG island, a human <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome clone containing exon 1 and the 5' region of p73 was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for p73 exon 1 methylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p73 was aberrantly methylated in approximately 30% of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for methylation in any other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines and primary ALLs, methylation was associated with transcriptional loss of p73 by reverse transcription-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We used single-strand conformational polymorphisms to screen for point mutations in a series of primary ALLs and found no mutations leading to a change in protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that methylation of p73 is a frequent event in specific types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and suggest that epigenetic silencing of p73 could have important consequences for cell-cycle regulation </plain></SENT>
