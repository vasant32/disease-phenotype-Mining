<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a group of 102 children with different immunological subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, both lymphoblastic and nonlymphoblastic, the clinical parameters - event free survival and overall survival were correlated with numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of 80 ALL patients genetic abnormalities were observed in 40 patients, from those 19 of numerical type, 17 of structural type and 4 with both, numerical and structural anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the whole ALL group observed 23 patients (28.75%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 died patients genetic abnormalities were found and in 6 cases less mature T-phenotype ALL has been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems, therefore, that immature T-phenotype with pathological karyotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of genetic anomalies presents the most risk group of patients of which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ALL patients, as a whole, with pathological karyotype have shown significantly lower event free survival rate, comparing to the group of ALL patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate was also lower in the first group, but statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> patients, in both groups, with and without pathological karyotype, event free survival rate and overall survival rate were also lower in the first group, but statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients with pathological karyotypes vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones overall survival rate was lower in the first group, but statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in overall survival rate in these patients between pathological and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In ANNL group of patients pathological karyotype was observed in 14 of them, with numerical anomalies in 6 patients, structural in 4 patients and both of them - numerical + structural in 4 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the whole ANLL group observed 11 (50%) patients died during the follow-up period (9 in relapse and 2 of treatment complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From 11 died patients in 81.8% pathological karyotype was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pathological karyotypes was observed in less mature M0-M2 ANLL subtype (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ANLL patients with pathological karyotype have shown significantly lower event free survival rate (in one of the two statistical log-rank analyses), comparing to the group of ANLL patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rate was also lower in the first group, but statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence/absence of CD34 marker expression in blast cells of our group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients did not show any difference in event free survival and overall survival rates </plain></SENT>
