<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Replication of these PR-159 viruses and another strain of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e>-2 virus adapted to Raji cells (16681-Raji virus) was measured in adherent and nonadherent mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> viruses except the S-1 PGMK virus replicated in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occasional replication of the S-1 PGMK virus was associated with reversion to parent virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition to the monocyte cultures of low concentrations of homologous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e>-2 antibody or non-neutralizing heterologous antibody increased the yield of the parent virus as much as 400-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon of immune enhancement usually enabled the S-1 PGMK virus to replicate slowly in monocytes, but the progeny virus produced large plaques similar to the parent virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Replication of the S-1 vaccine virus in cultured monocytes did not result in the appearance of large plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not recover S-1 vaccine virus from monocytes harvested from infected volunteers in the same manner that monocytes from natural human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> yield wild virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three passage levels of PR-159 virus were tested for replication in lymphocytes in comparison with the 16681-Raji virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only the 16681-Raji virus replicated in human lymphocytes cultured with or without enhancing antibody </plain></SENT>
