<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In about 80% of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell harbours a reciprocal chromosomal translocation which invariably transposes the coding exons 2 and 3 of c-myc from chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those t(8;14) translocations which disrupt chromosome 8 within or close to the c-myc gene are well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have focussed on t(8;14) translocations with the chromosomal breakpoint far upstream of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the breakpoint position in 44 BL cell lines with t(8;14) translocations of different geographical origin and identified 9 cell lines with the breakpoint more than 14 kb upstream of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cell lines the positions of the translocation junctions on the derivative chromosomes 8q- and 14q+ were mapped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints occur at distances between 55 and more than 340 kb upstream of c-myc with no preferential site on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On chromosome 14, however, the translocation breakpoints are clustered in a narrow region 5' of the intron enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 9 cases, the enhancer is fused to the c-myc bearing sequences of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases, the translocation has occurred in switch mu and downstream of C mu, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The impact of these results with respect to the hypothesis, that cis-regulatory sequences from the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus can deregulate c-myc expression in a manner sufficient for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> formation, is discussed </plain></SENT>
