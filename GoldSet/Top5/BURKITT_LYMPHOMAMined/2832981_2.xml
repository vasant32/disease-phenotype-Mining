<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>80% of the 500 people studied were under 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>82% of children under 5 years of age and 94% under 10 years of age were positive for IgG anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>51 of 100 children under 12 months of age and from 5 different provinces were positive for anti-VCA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 23 were under 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of anti-VCA antibody positivity was comparable in both sexes, in each age group and in the different provinces at different altitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Economic status, expressed in terms of estimated income, type of water supply, mode of excreta disposal and family size, did not significantly influence the distribution of anti-VCA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, early exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, with asymptomatic or subclinical presentation, probably accounts for the rarity of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> in young adult Ethiopians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of a relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> is briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
