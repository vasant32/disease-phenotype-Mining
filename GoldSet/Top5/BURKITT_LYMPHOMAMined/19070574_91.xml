<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most well characterized oncogenic translocations juxtaposes c-myc and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IgH) and is found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in humans and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA breaks in IgH leading to c-myc/IgH translocations are created by activation-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) during antibody class switch recombination or somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the source of DNA breaks at c-myc is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence for the c-myc promoter region being required in targeting AID-mediated DNA damage to produce DSBs in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations in primary B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> and DNA breaks in antibody genes, AID is also responsible for the DNA lesions in oncogenes that are required for their translocation </plain></SENT>
