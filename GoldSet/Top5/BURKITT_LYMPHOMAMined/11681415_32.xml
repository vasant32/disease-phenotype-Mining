<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26775">stilbene</z:chebi> phytochemicals <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi> have been reported to possess substantial antitumorigenic and antileukemic activities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent experimental data revealed the proapoptotic potency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, the molecular mechanisms underlying the antileukemic activity have not yet been studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>, as well as the hydroxylated analog <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi>, are potent inducers of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in BJAB Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with an ED50 concentration of 25 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further experiments revealed that treatment of BJAB cells with both substances led to a concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using BJAB cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the Fas-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> domain (FADD) adaptor protein to block <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in these cells is independent of the CD95/Fas signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore the antileukemic properties of both compounds in more detail, we extended our study to primary, leukemic lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27881">resveratrol</z:chebi> is a very efficient inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in this ex vivo assay with leukemic lymphoblasts of 21 patients suffering from childhood lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
