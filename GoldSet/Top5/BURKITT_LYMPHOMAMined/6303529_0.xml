<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the in vitro malignant progression of human lymphoid cells by the combined effect of genetic, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and mutagenic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A lymphoblastoid cell line immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus was used; it was derived from a patient suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> linked to a deficiency in DNA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were treated by sub-toxic doses of two potent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> (carcinogens), NQO (4-nitroquinolein-oxid) and R 7 000 (2-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-7-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-naphto-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35559">furan</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated cells showed an increased ability to form colonies in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>, among which some compact colonies appeared, different from the diffuse colonies formed by untreated control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sub-clones derived from these compact colonies differ also from the original cells by their behavior in liquid culture medium, by their increased tumorigenicity in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> Mice and by their capacity to form nodules on Chicken chorioallantoic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the sub-clones produce non-regressing large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> Mice with a cell inoculum lower than that required for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells while being less invasive than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, by their <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, the malignant cells of the sub-clones remain similar to the original lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, such a malignant progression obtained in vitro cannot be considered as identical to that which leads to Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in African children </plain></SENT>
