<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The p135tyk2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase appears to initiate, at least in part, the type I interferon signal transduction pathway, and thereby activates type I interferon-dependent gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine if p135tyk2 can suppress growth and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, derivatives of the tyk2 gene were introduced into the tumorigenic cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfectants expressing a tyk2 construct missing the carboxy-terminal 22 amino acids cloned with a greatly reduced efficiency in soft agar and displayed a partial decrease in the ability to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, transfectants producing a kinase deficient version of tyk2 show an increase in both growth rate and agar cloning efficiency, suggesting that the inactive kinase can act in a dominant-negative manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the carboxyl-terminal deleted protein lacks both auto-kinase activity, and activity towards a putative substrate, even though it induces a phenotype which is precisely the opposite of that produced by another kinase-deficient tyk2 mutant containing an altered ATP binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, while these results add tyk2 to a growing list of interferon-alpha regulated proteins that might be able to suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation, the biochemical basis of this activity remains unknown </plain></SENT>
