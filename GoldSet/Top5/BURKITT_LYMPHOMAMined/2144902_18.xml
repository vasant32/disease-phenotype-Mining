<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects are mediated through the interaction of interferons with specific cell surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the development of monoclonal antibodies against one of the subunits of the interferon alpha receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These antibodies detect a 110-kDa protein in surface-labeled cells and in Western blots, and 130- and 210-kDa bands after crosslinking to iodinated interferon alpha 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other subunits are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked to the 130-kDa subunit or are coprecipitated by these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the pI of this subunit is 3.5-5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the protein recognized by these monoclonal antibodies be named the alpha subunit of the interferon alpha receptor </plain></SENT>
