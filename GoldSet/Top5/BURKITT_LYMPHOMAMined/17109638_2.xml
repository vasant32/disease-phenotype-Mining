<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of iron deprivation on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induction in human Raji cells pre-adapted to differing availability of extracellular iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Iron deprivation was achieved by incubation in a defined iron-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Original Raji cells have previously been adapted to long-term culture in a defined medium with 5 microg/ml of iron-saturated human transferrin as a source of iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji/lowFe cells were derived from original Raji cells by subsequent adaptation to culture in the medium with 50 microm ferric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> as a source of iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji/lowFe-re cells were derived from Raji/lowFe cells by re-adaptation to the transferrin-containing (5 microg/ml) medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Iron deprivation induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in both Raji cells and Raji/lowFe-re cells; that is, cells pre-adapted to a near optimum source of extracellular iron (5 microg/ml of transferrin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, Raji/lowFe cells preadapted to a limited source of extracellular iron (50 microm ferric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>) became resistant to the induction of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by iron deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induction by iron deprivation in Raji cells correlates with the activation of executioner caspase-3 and the cleavage of caspase-3 substrate, poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two other executioner caspases, caspase-7 and caspase-6, were not activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we suggest that in human Raji cells, iron deprivation induces apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the sensitivity of the cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induction by iron deprivation can be reversibly changed by extracellular iron availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cells pre-adapted to a limited source of extracellular iron became resistant </plain></SENT>
