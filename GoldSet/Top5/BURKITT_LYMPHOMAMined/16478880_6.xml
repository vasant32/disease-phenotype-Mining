<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2 consecutive studies, conducted between 1996 and 2002, we treated 22 cases of infant ALL with germline MLL using chemotherapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year event-free survival rate was 95.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 86.9 to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 21 infants with precursor B-cell ALL have been in first complete remission for 3.5 to 8.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most treatment-related toxicities were predictable and well tolerated, and neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> nor physical growth impairments have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that chemotherapy of the type described here is both safe and highly effective against infant precursor B-cell ALL with MLL in the germline configuration </plain></SENT>
