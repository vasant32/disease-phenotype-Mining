<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the homozygous deletion of HuIFN-alpha and beta genes was detected in 5 of 11 cell lines and in 5 of 11 cell lines, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletions of both the HuIFN-alpha and beta genes were observed in 4 of 11 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line deleted only HuIFN-alpha gene, while the other T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line deleted only HuIFN-beta gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the deletions of HuIFN-alpha and beta genes may be related the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
