<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The host range of retroviral oncogenes is naturally limited by the host range of the retroviral vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question of whether the transforming host range of retroviral oncogenes is also restricted by the host species has not been directly addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have tested in avian and murine host species the transforming host range of two retroviral onc genes, myc of avian <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> viruses MH2 and MC29 and mht/raf of avian <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> virus MH2 and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus MSV 3611 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Virus vector-mediated host restriction was bypassed by recombining <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogenes with retroviral vectors that can readily infect the host to be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that, despite high expression, transforming function of retroviral myc genes is restricted to avian cells, and that of retroviral mht/raf genes is restricted to murine cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since retroviral oncogenes encode the same proteins as certain cellular genes, termed protooncogenes, our data must also be relevant to the oncogene hypothesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to this hypothesis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is caused by mutation of protooncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because protooncogenes are conserved in evolution and are presumed to have conserved functions, the oncogene hypothesis assumes no host range restriction of transforming function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, mutated human proto-myc is postulated to cause Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, because avian retroviruses with myc genes cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in birds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But there is no evidence that known mutated protooncogenes can transform human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings reported here indicate that host range restriction appears to be one of the reasons (in addition to insufficient transcriptional activation) why known, mutated protooncogenes lack transforming function in human cells </plain></SENT>
