<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>X 4; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> 200 mg/m2/12 hours i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X 7; 6-thioguanidine 100 mg/m2/12-hourly p.o X 7 and CCNU 200 or 250 mg/m2 p.o. single dose) followed by autologus bone marrow transplantation (853 to 20.000 CFUc/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received an induction treatment for large visible tumoral mass (group I: 3 initial presentations, 3 relapses) or a consolidation treatment for small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumour</z:e> (group II: 6 complete and 1 partial remissions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that autologous bone marrow transplantation shortens the duration of the therapeutic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>White cell (greater than 10(9)/l) and platelet (greater than 50.10(9)/l) recovery was observed on days 12 (range 9-19) and 14 (range 8-27) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group I, 1 patient died of myocardial TACC toxity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> on tumoral kidney; there were 2 failures and 3 complete remissions (8, 21, 45 + months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remissions occurred in patients treated initially; the overall survival since diagnosis was 48+, 48+ and 60+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group II patients there were 1 failure and 5 complete remissions persisting after a 2+ months to 30+ months follow-up; the overall survival was 23+, 24+, 27+, 42+ and 70+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3 failures in the series occurred in circumstances suggesting contamination of the cryopreserved bone marrow by tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The toxicity, largely due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, of the TACC-bone marrow transplantation combination was tolerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was clearly lower in group II (6 patients, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e>) than in group I (5/6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results confirm that there is room for autologous bone marrow transplantation in highly malignant non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly during complete remissions to facilitate the use of an aggressive consolidation chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
