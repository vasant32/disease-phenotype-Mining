<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antigen plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein requires both alpha and beta chains of the TCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The "superantigens" are a group of molecules that are recognized in association with MHC class II but that do not appear to conform to this pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Superantigens are defined as such because they cause the activation or thymic deletion of many or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T cells bearing specific TCR beta-chain variable region (V beta) elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strong association of particular V beta S with T-cell responses to superantigens suggests that their interaction with the TCR is fundamentally different from that of most antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have directly investigated the involvement of the beta chain in recognition of a superantigen by using a secreted, truncated TCR beta chain and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A complexed to cell-surface MHC class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that this interaction is specific for the enterotoxin and is dependent on MHC class II expression by the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reaction can be inhibited by antibodies against the three components of the reaction: V beta, enterotoxin, and class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This shows that the TCR beta chain is sufficient to mediate the interaction with a superantigen-class II complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TCR alpha chain and co-receptors such as CD4 are not required </plain></SENT>
