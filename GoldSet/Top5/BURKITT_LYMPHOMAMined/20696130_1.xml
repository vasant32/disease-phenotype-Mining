<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, numerous therapeutic antibodies have been developed for various diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental systems to effectively evaluate these candidate antibodies are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanisms used by antibodies to kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which natural killer cells (NK) are the main mediator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The capacity to induce ADCC has conventionally been assessed in the human-mouse xeno-graft model, in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), containing NK cells along with antibodies, are administered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing immunodeficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, contamination from other cellular populations often affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, making it difficult to evaluate the antibody's effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we established a new NK-dependent ADCC assay model using a supra-immunodeficient strain of mice, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/gammac(null) (NOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our model system simply consisted of three elements: isolated human NK cells, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Daudi), and an anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this experimental setting, human NK cells from healthy donors retained their killing activity and suppressed the growth of Daudi cells in NOG mice when they were administered along with Rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This system, therefore, is useful for evaluating the in vivo function of human NK cells </plain></SENT>
