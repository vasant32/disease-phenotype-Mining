<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have indicated that inactivation of p53 is one of the essential requirements for the unrestrained growth of tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the status of the p53 gene was examined in various types of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, mutations in p53 have been predominantly detected in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells, therefore suggesting that alteration of p53 could specifically contribute to the malignant phenotype of these tumoral cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to mutations, functional inactivation of p53 can also occur through interaction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> gene product with various <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular MDM2 protein, for example, is able to inhibit p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor function by concealing its transactivation domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mdm2 gene amplification has been described in several types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, resulting in overexpression of the MDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have examined the status of MDM2 and p53 in 20 BL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four were found to contain <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 and to overexpress MDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, both molecules are physically associated since they can be co-precipitated and p53 is inactivated as cells neither arrest in G1 nor enter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following gamma-radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also report that the high level of the MDM2 protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells is neither associated with an amplification of the mdm2 gene nor with an elevated level of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or an increased protein stability, but is rather due to an enhanced translation ability of the mdm2 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, overexpression of MDM2 protein regulated at the posttranscriptional level, induces an escape from p53-controlled cell growth </plain></SENT>
