<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> can be inhibited by survival factors such as insulin-like growth factor I or the bcl-2 proto-oncogene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deregulated c-Myc expression is a common feature in Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which the c-myc gene is reciprocally translocated and placed under the control of one of the immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 is an Epstein-Barr virus protein expressed early in the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BHRF1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family and has been shown to suppress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and to increase cell survival in different settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report that BHRF1 inhibits c-Myc-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> which occurs in the absence of survival factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It does not, however, affect the capacity of c-Myc to promote cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that BHRF1 has not only structural but also functional similarities to Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
