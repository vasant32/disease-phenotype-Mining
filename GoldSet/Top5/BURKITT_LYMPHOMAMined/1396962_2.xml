<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the trypsin-like serine protease activity of human tonsillar B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lysate of the low-density, in vivo activated B cells as well as the lysate of cells stimulated with anti-human IgM F(ab')2 show elevated trypsin-like serine protease activity compared to the resting subset as monitored by the cleavage of Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cleavage is sensitive to N-tosyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29967,32553">L-lysyl</z:chebi>-chloromethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41033">benzamidine</z:chebi> but not to iodoacetamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments with intact cells give similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding that the intact cells hydrolyze the substrate, while their supernatant does not, suggests that the protease activity is cell membrane associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that C3 is a substrate of the enzyme since the activated B cells cleave C3, whereas the resting B cells do not, and also C3 inhibits the enzyme-substrate reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the ex vivo B cells, we studied the serine protease activity of certain well-characterized B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show a correlation between the phenotype and the enzyme expression of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BL41, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, with a resting phenotype, has low activity, while its EBV genome-carrying convertants E95-A-BL41, E95-C-BL41, EHR-A-BL41 and BL41/95 that have the phenotype of activated B cells, have high proteolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lymphoblastoid cell line WW-1-LCL which has the phenotype of an immunoblast, has the highest serine protease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the above data, we suggest that a rather tight correlation exists between the degree of activation and the appearance of serine protease(s) on the surface of human B cells </plain></SENT>
