<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ligands (antigens) involved in this interaction have not been clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that some <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi> inhibit NK mediated cytolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion and that NK cell activity involves recognition of carbohydrate structures on target cells via receptors on the effector cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using human IL-2 or recombinant IL-2, we have found that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharides</z:chebi> inhibit IL-2 enhanced functional activity in a concentration-dependent fashion; that increased expression of endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharide</z:chebi> binding receptors on effector cells occurs after treatment with IL-2; and that greater quantities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharide</z:chebi> were required to obtain equivalent inhibition of IL-2 enhanced NK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data reinforces the growing belief that effector cells express receptors with different sugar specificities and that quantitative differences in sugar specificities is a likely reason for NK cells having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> polyclonal activity </plain></SENT>
