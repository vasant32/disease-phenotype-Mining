<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of T cell receptor (TCR) is the place through which T cells connect to the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lengths and DNA sequences of CDR3s are different according to different T cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This leads to a diverse TCR CDR3 repertoires which can reflects the functional status of T cells precisely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at elucidating the abnormality of TCR beta chain variable region (BV) CDR3 repertoires of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005435'>T cell dysfunction</z:hpo> and the immuno-reconstruction of T cells after the chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve children aged from 3 to 13 years (average 4.50 +/- 3.78 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> before chemotherapy and 8 healthy control donors aged from 6 to 16 years (average 10.30 +/- 3.00 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of 12 patients were studied for the second time 3 months after complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> sequencing gel electrophoresis were used to detect the diversity of TCR BV CDR3 repertoires of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The expression of BV2 and BV3 in 12 children increased and BV17 and BV18 decreased before the chemotherapy as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 4 children with a lower level expression of BV21 before the chemotherapy, and much lower level expression was found after the remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Normally each lane contained eight to ten bands, which represented unique CDR3 sizes for a given TCR BV family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bands differed in size by 3 nucleotides and generally form a Gaussian distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 14% TCR BV families with abnormal CDR3 length distribution in 12 patients before therapy, which was significantly higher than that of controls (5.5%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Restricted CDR3 length distribution was observed in BV14, BV1, BV16, BV20, BV13.1, BV13.2 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47924">BV6</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Every abnormal BV family recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Gaussian distribution 3 months after CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T lymphocytes in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> revealed markedly skewed repertoires, which suggests the abnormality of T cell functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most abnormal T cell repertoires recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Gaussian distribution 3 months after the first CR, which suggests the immunological reconstitution of T cell repertoires </plain></SENT>
