<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Southern blot analysis and complementarity determining region III polymerase chain reaction (CDRIII PCR), 18 cases of B-lineage ALL and 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 20 specimens from 18 B-lineage ALLs, two of four with p53 mutation and two of 16 without mutation had an unrearranged Ig and TCR genotype (p = 0.16; Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, the one case with p53 mutation had a rearranged TCR and Ig genotype and a case without mutation was unrearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that p53 mutation is an infrequent feature of ALL found, nonetheless, in every genotypic subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The p53 mutations in cases that do not further rearrange may support p53 involvement in lymphoid differentiation, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in differentiation stages in cases both with and without p53 mutations suggests that regulation of early lymphoid maturation is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
