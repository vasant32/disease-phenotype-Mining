<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, a potent inducer of differentiation in various cell systems, on the steady state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level and transcriptional activity of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> treatment a rapid decrease of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines studied, irrespective of the type of translocation, the location of the breakpoint relative to c-myc or of the association with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since cellular genes induced by interferon are suspected to play a role in c-myc regulation we have studied transcription of the 2-5A synthetase gene in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-treated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activity and steady state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of the 2-5A synthetase gene were induced by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time course of induction excluded, however, that the decrease of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is caused by induction of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L endonuclease system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is caused, at least in part, by a reduced transcription rate, as shown by nuclear run-on analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> is capable of downregulating a truncated c-myc gene indicates that an important target site of transcriptional regulation is located outside the region encompassing the upstream regulatory sequences, the dual promoters and the leader region </plain></SENT>
