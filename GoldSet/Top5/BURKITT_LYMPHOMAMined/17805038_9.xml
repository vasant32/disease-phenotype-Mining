<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between February 1986 and January 1991, children in complete remission after induction that included intramuscular E. coli ASP (6000 U/m2x6) were randomized for consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One regimen included intensive weekly intramuscular E. coli ASP (25,000 U/m2/wkx24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of an allergic reaction to E. coli ASP, Erwinia ASP was substituted at the same dose and schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 540 eligible patients, 408 switched to Erwinia ASP due to an allergic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allergic reactions were significantly associated with younger age, white race, and standard-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox analysis adjusting for these factors demonstrated no correlation between the switch per se or the timing of the switch and event-free survival </plain></SENT>
