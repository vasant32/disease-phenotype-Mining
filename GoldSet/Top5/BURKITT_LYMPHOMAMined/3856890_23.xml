<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 10- to 20-fold increase in resistance relative to the parental line was achieved in 3-4 months of continuous selection pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this time, further increase in selection pressure resulted in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, while removal of drug led to rapid loss of resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, by holding selection pressure constant over 8-12 months, semistable clones ranging in resistance up to 8- to 12-fold were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The half-life for resistance loss upon removal of drug was 2-3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of intermittent low concentrations of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi>, resistance has been maintained in excess of 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With one exception, the growth kinetics of the resistant clones were slightly slower than those of the parental lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cross-resistance studies were performed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30102,30103,30104">HN2</z:chebi>, BCNU, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, phenylalanine mustard, and hydroperoxycyclophosphamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was, in general, a lack of cross-resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that stable resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> is produced with difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that these semistable cloned human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines represent clinically relevant models for the study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> resistance and that the cross-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">resistance patterns</z:e> among these cells have important therapeutic and mechanistic implications </plain></SENT>
