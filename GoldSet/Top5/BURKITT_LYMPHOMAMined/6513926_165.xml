<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine myc protein products in the wide variety of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells having alterations of the c-myc locus, we have prepared an antiserum against a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the predicted C-terminal sequence of the human c-myc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This antiserum (anti-hu-myc <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi>) specifically precipitated two proteins of 64 and 67 kilodaltons in quantities ranging from low levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts to 10-fold-higher levels in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, to 20- to 60-fold-higher levels in cell lines having amplified c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p64 and p67 proteins were found to be highly related by partial V8 proteolytic mapping, and both were demonstrated to be encoded by the c-myc oncogene, using hybrid-selected translation of myc-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the p64 protein was specifically precipitated from cells transfected with a translocated c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both p64 and p67 were found to be nuclear phosphoproteins with extremely short half-lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines having alterations at the c-myc locus due to amplification or translocation, we observed a significant change in the expression of p64 relative to p67 when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or Epstein-Bar virus-immortalized cells </plain></SENT>
