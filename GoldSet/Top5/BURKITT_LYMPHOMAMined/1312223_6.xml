<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An in vitro model, called the Membrane Invasion Culture System (MICS), was used to study the invasive potential of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), an EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line of American origin and an EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> of African origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MICS measured the ability of these cell lines to invade reconstituted basement membrane-coated filters, which correlated with their tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the significantly greater invasive behaviour of the EBV-positive LCL was directly correlated with the cells' ability to express and secrete human type IV collagenase (72 kDa), an important metalloproteinase responsible for the degradation of collagen IV in basement membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that MICS and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse are useful tests of tumorigenicity in lymphoid cells, with measurable effects in both systems related to human type IV collagenase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both models allow further exploration of malignant phenotypes associated with EBV transformation of lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
