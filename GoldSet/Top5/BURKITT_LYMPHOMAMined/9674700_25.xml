<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The myc proto-oncogenes are transcription factors that directly regulate the expression of other genes, by binding to the specific DNA sequence, CACGTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the target genes for c-Myc regulation are ECA39, p53, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>), alpha-prothymosin and Cdc25A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the involvement of c-Myc target genes in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> induced by c-myc or N-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MCF-7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cells, the induction of c-myc expression by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> was followed by the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the Myc targets that we examined, indicating that those genes can serve as c-Myc targets in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumors</z:e> exhibiting c-myc overexpression, several Myc targets were also overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A clear correlation between the expression of c-myc and its targets was also detected in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which involve a specific translocation of c-myc gene, but not in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Yet, in cells derived from a neuronal origin the pattern of expression of Myc targets was more complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027828" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neuroepithelioma</z:e> cell line that overexpresses c-myc, only some targets were expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo>, in which N-myc is amplified and overexpressed, only <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> was overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other target genes were expressed in only some of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The more complex expression pattern found for the Myc targets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo> suggests that genes that were identified originally as targets for c-Myc regulation may be regulated by N-Myc, but other cell specific factors are also needed for transcription of the target genes </plain></SENT>
