<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether human B cells express IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 28 B cell lines including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid B cell lines (N = 7), EBV+ B cell lines derived from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with (N = 6) or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (N = 8), as well as seven EBV- B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected constitutive expression of IFN-gamma in every B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoters <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> and teleocidin appeared to enhance this IFN-gamma expression in nearly every B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 517 bp amplicons spanning the entire protein coding region of the IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from three representative lines were sequenced, definitively establishing that B cell IFN-gamma is identical to IFN-gamma from activated T cells and is not altered by derivation of the B cell lines from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients or by EBV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection of IFN-gamma in the entire panel of EBV+ and EBV- cell lines suggests that the IFN-gamma gene is broadly expressed by human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data imply that human B cells can be activated to produce IFN-gamma, further enmeshing B cells in the dynamics of immunoregulation </plain></SENT>
