<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the signal transduction mechanism underlying this process and to determine what, if any, relationship exists between Thy-1-dependent triggering and T cell activation mediated through the T3-antigen receptor (T3-Ti) complex, a genomic clone of murine Thy-1.2 was isolated and transfected into the human T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, Jurkat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transfected gene was actively transcribed in these human cells and high levels of Thy-1.2 glycoprotein were found on the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although certain mAbs to Thy-1.2 failed to bind to the Thy-1 transfected Jurkat cells, several known mitogenic anti-Thy-1 mAbs did react, and in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi>, induced IL-2 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One Thy-1+ transfectant out of five failed to produce IL-2 in response to anti-T3/Ti antibodies even though it retained the ability to increase intracytoplasmic calcium concentration [( <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) in response to these ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Thy-1 negative <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> of this cell regained anti-T3/Ti reactivity, suggesting a regulatory defect in signal transmission via T3/Ti in the original transfectant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the ability of Thy-1 to act as an activation receptor for T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They reveal a potential role for changes in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in this process, in common with other pathways of T cell activation, but also indicate a more complex series of events is involved </plain></SENT>
