<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">13-cis-retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA), 9-cis-RA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-RA (ATRA) powerfully inhibit the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether these compounds are effective at inhibiting the growth of B cells at more advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, including fully transformed B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, c-myc-transfected LCLs (myc-LCLs) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that 13-cis-RA, 9-cis-RA and ATRA also markedly inhibit the proliferation of myc-LCLs by inducing G(0)/G(1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> as well as enhancing rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 (DG75) of the 8 BL cell lines investigated were poorly RA-responsive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, unlike LCLs and myc-LCLs, RA-treated DG75 cells rapidly resumed proliferation upon drug removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cell cycle-regulatory proteins showed that, as in LCLs, strong up-regulation of p27(Kip-1) and increased levels of under-phosphorylated pRb and p130 were detected in RA-treated DG75 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the catalytic activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 G(1)-associated CDKs (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) was strongly inhibited in RA-treated LCLs, only CDK2-associated kinase activity was reduced in DG75 cells arrested in G(0)/G(1) by RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RA-treated DG75 cells failed to show the down-regulation of cyclin D3 observed in LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of receptor-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> showed that in LCLs and RA-responsive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, RA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> is mainly mediated by RARalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RARalpha-selective <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Ro 40-6055 was also effective at very low concentrations (10(-10) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, comparable levels of RARalpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in RA-responsive and -resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, indicating that mechanisms different from transcriptional deregulation of RARalpha probably underlie the differential responsiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
