<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of ICRF-154 in combination with 11 anticancer agents on four human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of two drugs (ICRF-154 and one other), and cell growth inhibition was determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of drug combinations at the ID50 level were analysed using the isobologram method (Steel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell lines, MOLT-3, HSB, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, supra-additive effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additive effects were observed for its combinations with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sub-additive to protective effects were observed in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukaemia</z:e> cell line, K-562, no drug showed supra-additive effects with ICRF-154, while sub-additive to protective effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other drugs showed additive effects with ICRF-154 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the combined effects of ICRF-154 with other agents vary, depending on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Against lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, ICRF-154 would be advantageous when administered simultaneously with many anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of such agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> are the most suitable, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> is least suitable for such combined treatment </plain></SENT>
