<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group of Japan (LSGJ) proposed a new classification of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs), diving NHLs into the follicular group consisting of three subsets and the diffuse group, 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each subset of the diffuse group is further divided into B or T cell types according to immunologic markers and/or morphologic prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the review of 118 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the authors studied the 109 cases of NHLs, attempting to assess the clinicopathologic utility of this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Morphologic criteria, enzyme histochemistry, and immunoperoxidase technique were used to ensure the accuracy of the immunologic phenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the LSGJ classification is easily reproducible and yields a more precise clinicopathologic correlation than traditional, morphologic classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with similar studies in Japan, this study demonstrated a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (7.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (8.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs) and a high incidence of T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (34.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence (45.9%) of extranodal presentation was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These four features seem characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Japan </plain></SENT>
