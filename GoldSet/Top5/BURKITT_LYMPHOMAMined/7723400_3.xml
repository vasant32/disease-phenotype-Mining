<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports demonstrated mutations of this gene in both Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, dissimilar results were obtained in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one study, no mutation was detected in 43 NHL tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second study reported p53 mutations in eight (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with advanced stage disease) out of 48 tissues obtained from Japanese NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using both immunoblotting and radio-immunoprecipitation, we detected mutant p53 proteins in nine out of 10 B cell lines established from NHL tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutations were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-mediated single-strand conformational polymorphism (RT-PCR-SSCP) analysis in eight cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of p53 mutation in NHL B cell lines and the relatively low frequency of p53 mutations in fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue suggests that p53 gene alteration may play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and/or disease progression in a subset of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that the p53 mutation conveys a proliferative advantage on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells that permits their in vitro growth </plain></SENT>
