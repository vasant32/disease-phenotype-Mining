<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither TIMP-1 complexed with progelatinase B nor TIMP-2 complexed with progelatinase A, both of which have full inhibitory activity against active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), showed any cell growth-promoting activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under steady-state conditions at 4 degrees C, high-(Kd = 0.15 nM) and low-(35 nM) affinity binding sites for TIMP-2 were identified on Raji cells with 20,000 and 1.4 x 10(5) sites/cell, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both high- and low-affinity binding of 125I-TIMP-2 to Raji cells were competitively inhibited by unlabeled TIMP-2 but not by unlabeled TIMP-1, suggesting the presence of receptors for TIMP-2 independent from those for TIMP-1 </plain></SENT>
