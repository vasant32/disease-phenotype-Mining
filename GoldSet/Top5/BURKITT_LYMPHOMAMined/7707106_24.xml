<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To correlate the presence of p53 mutations and initial characteristics, response to chemotherapy, and survival in newly diagnosed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (L3 ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> or L3 ALL, most of whom were treated with very intensive regimens, including early <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease treatment, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of p53 mutations was made by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 8 of the gene, and mutations were determined by direct sequencing of exons with abnormal SSCP findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of outcome between mutated and nonmutated cases was made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and also after excluding five patients who received therapeutic regimens considered as suboptimal and one patient who died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> while in complete remission (CR), as those six patients had no p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A point mutation was found in nine patients (19%), and consisted of a missense mutation in seven and a chain-terminating mutation in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSCP, sequence, and cytogenetic analysis strongly suggested that eight of nine patients with mutations had retained the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 allele, which had been lost in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by fluorescence-in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a p53-specific probe in two patients, including the one who had lost the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, mutations were significantly less frequent in patients with disseminated disease, ie, L3 ALL or stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (four of 35, 11%), than in more localized forms, ie, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> stage I, II, or III (five of 13, 38%) (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CR rates were similar in mutated (78%) and nonmutated cases (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actuarial disease-free interval (DFI) after 12 months and actuarial survival rates after 24 months were 49% and 66%, respectively, in patients with mutations, and 73% and 48%, respectively, those without mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that, contrary to what is seen in most other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, p53 mutations in newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and L3 ALL are not associated with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass or poor response to intensive therapeutic regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that this difference with most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be due to the fact that p53 mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and L3 ALL are generally associated with persistence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> residual p53 allele, contrary to what is observed in the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
