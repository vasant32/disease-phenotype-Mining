<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Fc-portions of whole antibodies were deliberately eliminated in this construct to avoid undesired effector functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A stabilised bsscFv, ds[CD19 x CD16], was generated, in which disulphide bonds bridging the respective variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) chains were introduced into both component single-chain (sc)Fvs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After production in 293T cells and chromatographic purification, ds[CD19 x CD16] specifically and simultaneously bound both antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum stability of ds[CD19 x CD16] was increased more than threefold when compared with the unstabilised counterpart, while other biological properties were not affected by these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity experiments, ds[CD19 x CD16] mediated specific lysis of both CD19-positive malignant human B-lymphoid cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> cells from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> or B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells, mononuclear cells (MNCs) from healthy donors and, in some instances, MNCs isolated from patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, were used as effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ds[CD19 x CD16] holds promise for the treatment of CD19(+) B-lineage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
