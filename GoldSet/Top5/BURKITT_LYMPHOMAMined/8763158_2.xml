<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of our work was to investigate the in vitro reactivity of gliadin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of natural and synthetic origin with various cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested cell lines of human, mouse and rat origin were agglutinated by enzymically digested gliadin (peptic-tryptic- and peptic-tryptic pancreatic digest of alpha-gliadin) in a concentration dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to test the specificity of binding, inhibition studies were performed using a panel of <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> as well as natural and synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from gliadin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found that among twelve tested <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> only fetuin and phosphomannan were able to inhibit the agglutination of K562 cells with peptic-tryptic- but not with peptic-tryptic pancreatic digest of alpha-gliadin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of inhibition by gliadin <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and most of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharides</z:chebi> suggests that agglutinating activity of gliadin is the result of a nonspecific binding of gliadin to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
