<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex consists of transmembrane (m) Ig, in non-covalent association with a disulphide-linked heterodimer of mb-1 and B29 gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MB-1-B29 heterodimer is required for deposition of the BCR at the plasma membrane, as well as for coupling of the antigen receptor to intracellular signal transduction cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed biosynthetic labelling studies using the mature B cell line Ramos to investigate the process of assembly of the BCR components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that association of the four components, Ig-heavy chain (HC) and -light chain (LC), MB-1 and B29, is required and sufficient to permit exit of the BCR complex out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the short pulse labelling procedures used, no evidence was found for transient participation of other molecules in complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 32 kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was identified, which is serologically related to MB-1, but has a more acidic isoelectric point (pl) and a protein backbone of 21 kDa, as compared with 25 kDa for MB-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protein did not appear to participate in BCR complex formation and is most likely degraded prior to reaching the cis-Golgi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MB-1 component was found to be the rate-limiting step in BCR complex formation, while Ig-HC, -LC and B29 are synthesized in excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ig-HC and -LC form disulphide-linked tetrameric complexes within 3 min after biosynthesis, with which B29 and MB-1 components associate independently, followed by disulphide bond formation between these heterodimeric partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While partial BCR complexes containing B29 and mlg-H2L2 tetramers are rapidly formed and have a half-life of a few hours in the ER, entry of MB-1 into these complexes controls exit out of this compartment </plain></SENT>
