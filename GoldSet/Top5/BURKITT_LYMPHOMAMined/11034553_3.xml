<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cells of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji differential expression of host cell genes was analysed in the early phase (150 min) post stimulation with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> to display the cell activities that precede the activation of the EBV lytic cycle using the differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple fragment cDNAs derived from control cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi>-stimulated cells were amplified using random primers and displayed via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of 8,400 bands was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven differentially expressed fragment cDNAs were reamplified and identified by nucleotide sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of these could be identified as coding for proteins that may take part in virus reactivation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was the induction of s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cellular enzyme AHCY plays an important role in transmethylation reactions controlling the replication of several viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus. an involvement in EBV replication can be suggested </plain></SENT>
