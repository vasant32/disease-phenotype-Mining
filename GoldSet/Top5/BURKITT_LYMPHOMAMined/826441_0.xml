<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared with Dq, n and D37 values of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells for high LET radiation was smaller than that of other cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the hypothesis that in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells the recovery capacity from sublethal damage (Dq) is so small even after low LET irradiation that LET does not modify the suppression of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar survival curves with n value closely equal to 1 were obtained for four different mammalian cell lines (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> p3HR- 1, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> HMV, HeLa-S3, and L5178Y) after 2 MeV neutron irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This fact may suggest that the radiation which has an LET value at which n value of the survival curve is to be 1 will be optimum for therapeutic purpose to the radioresistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
