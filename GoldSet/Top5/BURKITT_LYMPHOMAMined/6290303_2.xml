<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over 50 B-cell derived lines and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> biopsies were screened for expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 13 sIgM-positive lines bound more than five times as much virus as the six IgG lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the biopsies, the 17 sIgM, 11 sIgM and sIgD, and seven sIgG expressing biopsies were further divided according to expression of the C3 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C3 receptor-positive biopsies, which expressed sIgM alone or along with sIgD, had the largest subpopulation of cells which expressed the EBV receptor (EBVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C3 receptor-negative biopsies only expressed the EBVR on half as many cells as their C3 receptor-positive counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the relative number of EBVR on individual EBVR-positive cells was independent of C3 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the sIgG class, both C3 receptor-negative and positive cells expressed equally low levels of EBVR, both in terms of subpopulation and relative number of EBVR per positive cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that subpopulation expression of the EBV receptor is related to the C3 receptor but that relative number of receptors per cell is associated with sIg phenotype </plain></SENT>
