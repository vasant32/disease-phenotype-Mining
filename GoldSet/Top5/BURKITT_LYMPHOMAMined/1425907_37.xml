<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify other genes which either mark important steps in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> or which reflect the cellular differentiation state of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells we have compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to immortalized lymphoblastoid B cells by subtractive hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a complementary DNA clone which encodes a novel member of the superfamily of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi>-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors, designated BLR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and lymphatic tissues but not in other cell lines either of the B cell lineage or of other hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This exclusive expression of BLR1 and the oncogenic potential of this receptor class supports the hypothesis that BLR1 exerts a regulatory function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> and/or B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the protein sequence is highly related to that of receptors for the cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 and other neutrophil chemoattractants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BLR1 may represent a potential candidate involved in the process of physiologic trafficking, cell-cell interactions, and activation of mature B lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues </plain></SENT>
