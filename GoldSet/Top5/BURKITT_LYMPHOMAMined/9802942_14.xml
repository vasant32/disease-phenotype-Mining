<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several data suggest that immature lymphoid cells are more prone to penetration and therefore are affected more by antibodies than their mature counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the penetration of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies in several models of immature cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results confirm that most anti-DNA antibodies penetrate larger proportions of immature cells than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also proven that anti-DNA antibodies induce larger fractions of immature cells to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than mature cells; however, there is not a numerical association between penetration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the penetration and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of several anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies into U937 and NIH-3T3 cells followed a rather <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When mature and immature cells were stimulated polyclonally, it was shown that polyreactive antibodies might act as an accessory signal to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in immature cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This process could contribute to the edition of the immune repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that naturally occurring polyreactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, through penetration and deletion of self-reacting cells, could participate, either as a unique or secondary signal, in the mechanism of self tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If these polyreactive antibodies undergo affinity maturation, it is possible they may develop into pathogenic antibodies </plain></SENT>
