<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD22 is a membrane glycophosphoprotein found on nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy B-lymphocytes and most B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent in vitro studies have identified several anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block the interaction of CD22 with its ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these mAbs, HB22.7, has been shown to effectively induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in several B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> xenograft studies with Raji-xenograft mice were used to assess the toxicity and efficacy of HB22.7 alone and with combined modality immunotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53621">CMIT</z:chebi>) with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> (90)Y-DOTA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-Lym-1 radioimmunotherapy (RIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the sequence of these agents on the combined treatment was assessed by administering HB22.7 24 hours before, simultaneously with, or 24 hours after RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the groups treated with RIT alone or with RIT and HB22.7 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53621">CMIT</z:chebi>), the reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was the greatest when HB22.7 was administered simultaneously with and 24 hours after RIT, and in the RIT treatment groups, this translated into the greatest overall response and survival, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates at the end of the 84-day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53621">CMIT</z:chebi> trial were 67% and 50% in the groups treated with HB22.7 simultaneously and 24 hours after RIT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This compared favorably with the untreated and the RIT alone groups, which had survival rates of 38% and 43% at the end of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, when compared with untreated controls and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other treatment groups, the greatest cure and overall survival rates were observed in the group treated with HB22.7 alone, with 47% cured and 76% surviving at the end of the 84-day trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RIT clearance was not affected by treatment with HB22.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with RIT alone, there was no significant additional hematologic (white blood cell, red blood cell, or platelet count) toxicity when HB22.7 was added to RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonhematologic toxicity (assessed as change in body weight) was also unchanged when HB22.7 was added to RIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus the anti-CD22 ligand-blocking antibody HB22.7 has independent lymphomacidal properties and augments the efficacy of (90)Y-DOTA-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-Lym-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts without significant toxicity </plain></SENT>
