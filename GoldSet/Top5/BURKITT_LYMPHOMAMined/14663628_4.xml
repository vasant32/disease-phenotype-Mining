<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">Phenothiazines</z:chebi> with different chemical structure and hydrophobicity were used: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="3647">chlorpromazine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi>); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6838">levomepromazine</z:chebi> (LVPZ); prometazine (PMZ); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45951">trifluoperazine</z:chebi> (TFPZ); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9566">thioridazine</z:chebi> (TRDZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cell lines used were: Daudi and Raji (derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), K-562 (derived from myelogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>-1, MOLT-4, HPB-ALL and CCRF-HSB-2 (derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> was determined by a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, using ATP bioluminescence as a marker of cell viability as well as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of leukemic cells was determined using a CellTiter-AQ cell proliferation assay which is based on the reduction of a <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-tetrazolium compound to the formazan product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction was estimated using phosphatidylserine (PSer) translocation to the cell surface and DNA fragmentation as characteristics of the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">Phenothiazines</z:chebi> (at concentrations in the range 0.1-10 micro M) did not affect the viability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes during a 24-h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, about 15-20% increase in ATP bioluminescence was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells during treatment with 40 micro M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> manifested strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most powerful drugs were TFPZ and TRDZ, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They showed a significant cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells even at 5-10 micro M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive cell lines were MOLT-4 and Raji, and the most resistant were HPB-ALL and CCRF-HSB-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> induced PSer exposure on the surface of leukemic cells, but not of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TFPZ, TRDZ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi> also induced DNA fragmentation in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leukemic cell lines during a 48-h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The strongest apoptotic agent was TRDZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction was not accompanied by a significant release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of native cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the drugs markedly suppressed Ca(2+)-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release in isolated mitochondria of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in clinically relevant doses (up to 20 micro M) some <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> (TFPZ, TRDZ, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3647">CPZ</z:chebi>) expressed a selective cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in leukemic cells without any influence on the viability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is considered that the mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi>-treated leukemic cells is associated with inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA polymerase and decreased ATP production, which are crucial events for the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
