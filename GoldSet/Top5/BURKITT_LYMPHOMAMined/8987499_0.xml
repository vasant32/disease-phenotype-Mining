<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An expression plasmid for pro-UKS1, pMo1UKS1SEd1-5, was constructed and introduced into Namalwa KJM-1 cells (Hosoi et al., 1988), and cells resistant to G418 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst them, the highest pro-UKS1 producer (resistant to 500 nM of MTX), clone 41-8, was selected and further characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clone 41-8 was cultured in serum-free ITPSGF medium (Hosoi et al., 1988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under the conventional conditions, the concentration of pro-UKS1 reached 26 micrograms ml-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and tri-iodothyronine (T3) improved productivity, and the maximal productivity of pro-UKS1 was 67 micrograms ml-1 day-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this conditioned medium, content of pro-UKS1 was above 80% of total proteins </plain></SENT>
