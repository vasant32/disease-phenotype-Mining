<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes is generally thought to be regulated by the combination of the VH promoter with the enhancer element which is located in the JH-CH intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is probably an oversimplification: there are cell lines that transcribe IgH genes despite the deletion of the intron-enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings could imply that other enhancer element(s) exist in the IgH locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a strong B-cell-specific enhancer is indeed located at the 3'-end of the rat IgH locus, 25 kilobases downstream of C alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This enhancer should be retained downstream of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rearranged IgH genes, regardless of the VH or CH segment used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together with analogous findings for the mouse kappa locus, the results prompt a re-evaluation of the mechanism of regulation of immunoglobulin gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, unlike the intron-enhancer, the IgH 3' enhancer would become linked to a c-myc that rearranges into an IgH switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IgH 3' enhancer could therefore play a part in the activation of the translocated c-myc genes in rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e>, mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
