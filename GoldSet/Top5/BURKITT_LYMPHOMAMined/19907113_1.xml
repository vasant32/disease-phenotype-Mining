<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients, 14 females and one male, ranged in age from 41 to 73 years with a median age of 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arose not only in the salivary gland (n=4) but also in other mucosal extranodal sites (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, six cases were marginal zone B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MZBL) of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, three cases were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) + MALT type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two cases were nodal MZBL and one case each was small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, CD10(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> + nodal MZBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using in situ hybridization, numerous Epstein-Barr virus(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were detected only in the case of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no human-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> type 8(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in any of the 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no API2-MALT1 fusion transcript in any of the eight cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with SJS also frequently affected extranodal organs in patients from Japan as well as from patients in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in patients with SJS also appear to be low-grade MZBLs or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> probably derived from MZBL both in Western countries and in Japan </plain></SENT>
