<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line was established from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> of a patient with a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> which originated from an ileocecal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell line, designated KAL-1, has been passaged 280 times over a period of 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cell line was successfully maintained in a chemically defined serum-free medium; its doubling time is approximately 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunologically, the cells were demonstrated to express IgM lambda on the cell surface and to react with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigen including B1, B4, HLA-DR, and common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic leukemic antigen but not with B2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the T-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangements of both JH and C lambda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that this cell line represents the B-cell lineage at the immature B-cell stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cell line was negative for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen and had no detectable Epstein-Barr virus genome in cellular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analyses revealed that the cells carried an 8;22 chromosome translocation, reminiscent of variant type Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no histological evidence for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies showed that KAL-1 had deregulated high constitutive expression of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This cell line was demonstrated to be highly tumorigenic when injected into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model should provide clues about the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and appears to be a useful in vivo model for the study of molecular events during B-cell differentiation and therapeutic investigations </plain></SENT>
