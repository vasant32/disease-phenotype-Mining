<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family have been shown to regulate the terminal differentiation of adipocytes and hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cell lineages, high levels of C/EBP alpha are found only in mature, nondividing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, we have determined the temporal order of expression for C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta in differentiating myelomonocytic marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies show a unique temporal pattern of C/EBP isoform expression in the myeloid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, C/EBP alpha expression is very high in proliferative myelomonocytic cells, and diminishes during phenotypic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While we have detected C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta in multiple myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines, and C/EBP alpha in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myeloid cells and in de novo human myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, we have not detected these C/EBP isoforms in either erythroid or lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta protein and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels correlate in maturing granulocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The formation of tissue-specific combinations of C/EBP homodimers and heterodimers may allow this family of transcription factors to regulate different sets of genes in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myelomonocytes </plain></SENT>
