<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of BJAB and NC-37 cells with P3HR-I EBV synthesis of early antigen (EA) was not affected by canavanine in concentrations up to 8.4 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) and of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) was significantly inhibited at concentrations higher than 2.8 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous induction of EA in P3HR-I cells was not affected by canavanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EA induction by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> resulted in some <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen induction depending on the time period of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the cells overnight with canavanine followed by washing and addition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter did not suppress EA induction by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the concept that EA induction by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> follows a different pathway from antigen induction by chemical inducers </plain></SENT>
