<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induced DRA expression involves activation of restricted protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, resulting in activated activator protein-1-dependent transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report expression profiles and activation of PKC were analyzed in human Raji B lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection analysis with target plasmids containing either DRA promoter (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutated) or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> response elements demonstrated that pretreatment with the selective PKC inhibitor GF 109203X repressed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-mediated activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western analysis performed on cellular fractions of resting cells and of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-activated cells revealed abundant expression of classical PKC-alpha (cPKC-alpha), cPKC-betaII, and atypical PKC-zeta isoforms and identified a sustained translocation of cPKC-alpha and cPKC-betaII from the cytosolic compartment to membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, the distribution of atypical PKC-zeta was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment and displayed an even distribution between cytosol and membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-mediated translocation of cPKC-alpha and cPKC-betaII was not influenced by pretreatment with GF 109203X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, functional activation and translocation of PKC were investigated with a selective in vitro kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these results show that activated HLA-DRA expression in response to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> treatment is strictly dependent on PKC activation acting on the X2 box of the DRA promoter and that selective inhibition of PKC enzymatic activity does not influence subcellular localization of expressed PKC isoenzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the translocation event per se occurs independently of PKC activation in these cells </plain></SENT>
