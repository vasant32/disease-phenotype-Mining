<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The influence of ligand:receptor affinity on B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the IgM+ Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, Ramos, was evaluated with a group of affinity-diverse murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for human B-cell IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies showed not only a minimal affinity threshold for the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but, interestingly, also a maximal affinity threshold above which increases in affinity were associated with diminished <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesser capacity of high-affinity MoAb to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was paralleled by a lesser capacity to induce receptor cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At high ligand concentration, high MoAb affinity was also associated with a diminished capacity to induce early protein tyrosine phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compromised capacity of two high-affinity MoAbs to trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be, at least in part, explained by two separate phenomena that can impair the formation of mIgM cross-links: (1) more stable univalent binding and (2) a tendency for monogamous binding of both MoAb Fab to two Fab <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on mIgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These in vitro studies suggest that the use of the highest affinity MoAbs for antireceptor immunotherapies that depend on receptor cross-linking might, on occasion, be contraindicated </plain></SENT>
