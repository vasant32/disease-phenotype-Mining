<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clinicopathological study was performed on 86 AIDS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients who were treated in Tokyo area from 1987 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> detected by autopsy was 27% (53 cases/198 autopsies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most predominant histological subtype throughout the period (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) increased from 2% in the pre-HAART era (before end-1997) to 13% in the HAART era, whereas incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> did not vary between HAART users and non-users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> decreased from 88% in the pre-HAART era to 58% in the HAART era, but did not differ significantly between HAART users (73%) and non-users (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nodal involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased from 14% in the pre-HAART era to 50% in the HAART era; however, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement decreased from 62 to 38% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that HAART might play a partial role in these changes, and the alteration in immunological backgrounds, such as EBV prevalence, is suggested as another leading cause of these changes in Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
