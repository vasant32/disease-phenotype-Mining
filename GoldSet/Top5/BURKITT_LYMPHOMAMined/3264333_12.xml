<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical detection of CD1c antigen is described in mantle zone B-cells of the tonsil, lymph node, and spleen, and also in the marginal zone B-cells of the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD1c expression was observed in most cases of low-grade, but in only a single case of high-grade, B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was not detected in germinal centre cells, nor in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This distribution suggests that CD1c expression may occur preferentially in slowly proliferating B-cell populations and does not support previous suggestions that CD1c is a human equivalent of the mouse thymus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> antigens </plain></SENT>
