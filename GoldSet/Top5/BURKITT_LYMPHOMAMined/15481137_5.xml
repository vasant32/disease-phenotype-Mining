<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Macrophages infiltrate these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in large numbers and engage in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we tested the hypothesis that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells may provide a mechanism for recruitment of macrophages to these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that monocytes and macrophages, but not neutrophils, preferentially migrated to apoptotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells with the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 both prevented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and abolished macrophage chemotaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macrophage migration to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> populations correlated well with the number of apoptotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells present (the Pearson correlation r = 0.81, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chemoattraction of murine macrophages to apoptotic human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells demonstrated that the mechanism was conserved across these species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify the macrophage receptors involved in this process, we investigated whether CD14 and CD36, two receptors important in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, were also involved in the chemotactic macrophage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages from CD14-/- and CD36-/- mice moved as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> macrophages in chemotaxis assays towards apoptotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Migrating macrophages were found to be up-regulated in their expression of CD14, however, suggesting that, although this receptor does not appear to be required for 'sensing' apoptotic cells, it may be up-regulated on the surface of the migrating macrophage in readiness for apoptotic corpse clearance </plain></SENT>
