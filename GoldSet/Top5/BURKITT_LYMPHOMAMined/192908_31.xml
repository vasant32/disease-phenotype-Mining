<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its DNA-binding properties were studied by DNA-cellulose chromatography and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release complement fixation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA binds to both double-stranded and single-stranded calf thymus DNA, showing a higher affinity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable difference in the DNA binding of EBNA prepared from Raji and AW-Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
