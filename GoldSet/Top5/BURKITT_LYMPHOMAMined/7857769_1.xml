<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results have disclosed that, with respect to controls, interferon induces an evident stimulation of label incorporation into nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incorporated [3H] PI has been found for phosphorylation and hydrolytic cleavage, indicating that the intranuclear transduction system activated by interferon at plasma membrane level, might involve the PI cycle as a possible route of intracellular signalling </plain></SENT>
