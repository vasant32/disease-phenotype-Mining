<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL) are thought to be derived from germinal centre B-cells in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, expression profiling has revealed that HRS cells do not show a germinal centre B-cell-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the nature of this aberrant phenotype and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, it has been reported that the activity of NOTCH1 plays an important role in the growth and survival of HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some leukaemic cell lines, the effect of Notch signalling is mediated by the early transcription factor GATA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This and the fact that HRS cells lack expression of PU.1, which can repress Gata-2, led to an investigation of GATA-2 expression in HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GATA-2 expression was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cHL-derived cell lines studied, but not in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 50% of biopsies from patients with cHL contained GATA-2-expressing HRS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centre B-cells nor malignant cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> expressed GATA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, GATA-2 expression was found specifically in HRS cells of cHL, suggesting that GATA-2 is important in establishing the abnormal B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> of HRS cells </plain></SENT>
