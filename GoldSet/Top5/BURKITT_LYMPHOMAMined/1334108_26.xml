<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major subset expresses the TCR V-segments V gamma 9 and V delta 2 and proliferates in response to ligands revealed by various microorganisms, and the cell line Daudi in addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The minor group is less homogenous on the gamma-chain but is almost completely identified by mAb against the V delta 1 segment; there is no ligand known to promote growth of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that gamma delta T cells out of this subgroup are strongly stimulated in vitro by cells from several Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines enhanced the stimulatory ability towards the T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> influenced the expression of a variety of cell surface molecules including ICAM-1 and LFA-3, no correlation to the gamma delta T cell-stimulating capacity became apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and transformed B cells express ligands of cellular origin for a hitherto poorly characterized subgroup of human gamma delta T cells </plain></SENT>
