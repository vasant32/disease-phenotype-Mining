<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of this methodology to the investigation of Epstein-Barr virus integration in the Namalwa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line has revealed two EBV genomes closely integrated at the known site on chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detecting sequences as small as 5 kb, we further demonstrate resolution within interphase nuclei of two fragments of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome spaced only 130 kb apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes are in opposite orientations and separated by roughly 340 kb of cellular DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates the feasibility and resolving power of interphase chromatin mapping to assess the proximity of closely spaced DNA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Implications for virology, gene mapping, and investigation of nuclear organization are discussed </plain></SENT>
