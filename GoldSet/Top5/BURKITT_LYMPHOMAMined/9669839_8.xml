<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell line designated Z-138 that was derived from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) whose disease underwent transformation to a rare, aggressive form of mature B-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line has an L3 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, ultrastructural characteristics of lymphoblasts, B-lineage surface markers and an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement identical to the rearrangement observed in the patient's blasts from whom the cell line was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Z-138 cells produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and high levels of granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), but they do not exhibit a proliferative response to either cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the patient's lymphoblasts and Z-138 cells exhibited cytogenetic abnormalities including t(8;14), t(14;18) and a chromosome 11 abnormality similar to the t(11;14) of the parental cells, resulting in marked overexpression of cyclin D1 (BCL-1 (PRAD1)) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in Z-138 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since these karyotypic anomalies have been associated with low grade (t(14;18)), intermediate grade (t(11;14)) and high grade (t(8;14)) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, their development may be involved in the unusual aggressive transformation of this patient's CLL </plain></SENT>
