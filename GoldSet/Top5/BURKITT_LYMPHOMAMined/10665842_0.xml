<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the results of surface and intracellular markers in 42 T-ALL, 86 B-ALL and 71 AML cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against T-cell, B-cell, myeloid cell and non-lineage specific structures has been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had dual-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping performed by FACStar flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correct immunological diagnosis of followed new cases before any treatment has been performed and simultaneously the presence of atypical/aberrant phenotypes has been studied and correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells differentiation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A great deal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, in opposite to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases, revealed a high proportion of atypical phenotypes (55, 75 and 36%, respectively), which are absent in nonleukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found out that these atypical phenotypes were present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (not clearly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differentiation stages and so we obtained an evidence that they might represent an abnormal/atypical rather than an immature phenotype, as it was postulated till now by several authors </plain></SENT>
