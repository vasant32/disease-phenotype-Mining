<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival, growth, differentiation, and isotype switching of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23, ICAM-1, and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions </plain></SENT>
