<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its immunological and biological properties have not been extensively studied because the production of IgA class monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the properties of IgA and IgG mAbs against Shiga toxin B subunits (Stx1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mAbs were secreted from hybridomas that had been produced from mice after intranasal immunization with recombinant Stx1B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholera</z:e> toxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dose response curves for the binding of the IgA (clone G2G7) and IgG (clone D11C6) mAbs to immobilized Stx1B were similar, as revealed on ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the IgA mAb formed dimers while the IgG mAb was monomeric, as judged by immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IgG mAb completely inhibited the binding of Stx1B to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ramos, while the inhibition by the IgA mAb was only partial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IgG mAb was able to neutralize the cytotoxicity of Stx1 holotoxin towards Vero cells, whereas the IgA mAb was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The binding affinity of each binding site was compared by means of surface plasmon resonance analysis involving a capture method, with which the binding of soluble Stx1B to immobilized mAb was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association rate was similar but the dissociation rate was twofold faster in the case of the IgA mAb, resulting in twofold higher affinity of the IgG mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that one can obtain high affinity IgA mAb but toxin neutralization is another challenge as to therapeutic antibodies of the IgA class </plain></SENT>
