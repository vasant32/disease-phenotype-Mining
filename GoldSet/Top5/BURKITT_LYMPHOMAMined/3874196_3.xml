<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of additional data from a second study of 33 Ghanaian patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 54 Ghanaian controls matched for age and ethnic origin showed that 39.4% of cases, but only 14.8% of controls, had HLA-DR7 (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of 3.7 is similar to that observed in the earlier study (3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combining the earlier and present studies, analysis of clinical data from 94 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 116 controls shows the relative risk of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among individuals with HLA-DR7 was 3.4 (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an increased relative risk of the disease associated with HLA-DR7 in: patients under 10 years of age; and patients with advanced stages of disease (Stage III or IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, comparison of relative risks by sequential analysis of 2 X 2 tables showed that these differences by age and stage were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
