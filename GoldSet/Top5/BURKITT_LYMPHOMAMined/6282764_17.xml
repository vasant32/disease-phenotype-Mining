<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Control values were determined for 60 apparently healthy Nigerians, S-IRPH and S-GGT were above the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit, defined as the mean + 2 SD of the controls, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one with secondary liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, whereas only one S-IRPH value and three S-GGT values exceeded this limit in the patients with other malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean S-Pro(III)-N-P was even more elevated than S-IRPH and S-GGT in the primary and secondary liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> cases, but was also elevated in other malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>; about one third of the patients with no evidence of liver involvement had a concentration exceeding the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high correlation was found between the values for the three assays both in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and in the whole series of malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that primary and secondary malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>neoplasms of the liver</z:hpo> have a high rate of collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three assays may be of some value in the diagnosis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and secondary liver involvement in other malignant diseases, and in monitoring the treatment provided </plain></SENT>
