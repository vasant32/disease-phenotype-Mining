<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated four patients in whom histologically confirmed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> developed during a one-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were young adults living within 50 km of each other in a rural area of Pennsylvania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients were related by marriage, but there was no contact with or between the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are not associated with the Epstein-Barr virus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients showed spectra and titers of antibodies to antigens related to that virus that were characteristic of virus-associated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> DNA and numerous cells with virus-determined nuclear antigen were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens available from three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases are unusual, since time-space clustering of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> associated with Epstein-Barr virus has been observed thus far only in Africa </plain></SENT>
