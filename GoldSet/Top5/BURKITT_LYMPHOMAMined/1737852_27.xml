<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>p53 mutations were found to occur, but at a low frequency (4 of 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four mutations were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism, the comparative sensitivity of RNase protection was 50% (2 of 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygosity was retained at mutated codons in 3 of 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One pedigree was consistent with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e>, and bone marrow from both diagnosis and remission indicated a germline G to T transversion at codon 272 (valine to leucine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although members of another family were affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 was nonhereditary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two nonhereditary p53 mutations included a T to G transversion at codon 270 (phenylalanine to cysteine) and a G to C transversion at codon 248 (arginine to proline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the role of both hereditary and acquired p53 mutations in the pathogenesis and/or progression of some cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
