<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the clinicopathological features of 317 gastric B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and characterized the differences among low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (LG), high-grade MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (HG), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases included 126 DL, 71 HG, 98 LG, 10 FL, three Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nine of undefined type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age range of patients was as follows: LG, 14-96 years (mean, 61.1); HG, 20-87 years (mean, 63.9); DL, 16-88 years (mean, 62.8); and FL, 54-76 years (mean, 65.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in age with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more women patients with LG (female:male, 55:43), while males predominated among DL patients (54:72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sexes were represented almost equally in HG cases (34:37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological findings, especially in DL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, correlated significantly to the gross appearance of mass formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dutcher bodies were encountered mainly in HG or LG cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showed no differences in age, sex or site of disease between LG, HG and DL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> correlated strongly to gross appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dutcher bodies were important for the diagnosis of gastric MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
