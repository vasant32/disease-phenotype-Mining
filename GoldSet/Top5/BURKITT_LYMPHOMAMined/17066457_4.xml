<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to examine demographic correlates of body mass index (BMI) changes over time from diagnosis through chemotherapy for children with B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 307 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL who were treated at four South Texas pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> centers between 1990 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To minimize treatment-related variability, we excluded patients who received cranial irradiation as part of their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variation in age- and gender-standardized BMI z-scores according to age at diagnosis, gender, and ethnicity were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall study cohort exhibited an increase in age- and gender-adjusted BMI z-scores for the first 24 months of chemotherapy followed by a slight decrease in BMI at 30 months (end of therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A repeated measures analysis indicated a statistically significant difference in the time-related pattern of BMI changes for age at diagnosis (P = 0.001) but no significant effect for gender (P = 0.32) or Hispanic versus non-Hispanic ethnicity (P = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In our cohort of ALL patients, BMI was elevated at diagnosis (mean standardized BMI z-score = 0.22, standard deviation = 1.4) then increased and remained elevated for the entire duration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children who were 2-9 years of age at diagnosis began therapy with a substantially lower BMI and remained lower over the course of chemotherapy than patients aged 10-18 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It will be important for future investigations to explore the biological and behavioral factors that may underlie such differential patterns of BMI change over time </plain></SENT>
