<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elderly <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) is a rare condition associated with low complete remission (CR) rate and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to improve these results, we evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of Daunoxome, a liposomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, exhibiting toxicity profile and pharmacokinetic indices better than standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 15 consecutive patients with nonmature ALL were enrolled on a prospective phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No exclusion was made because of older age, poor performance status and organ dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 69 years; performance status resulted &gt;/=2 in nine patients (60%), six patients (40%) were bcr-abl positive and two-thirds of the patients had comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction therapy consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, Daunoxome and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in CR received one or two consolidation cycles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and topotecan followed, in patients achieving CR, by a two-year rotating maintenance course including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, Daunoxome, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 11 patients (73%) achieved CR, three patients (20%) died early during the induction phase and one patient (7%) had resistant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (33%) relapsed after 5-21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 20 months, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 36 and 38%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Major toxicity included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience demonstrates that a high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> as liposomal compound can be safely administered in elderly ALL, exhibiting high antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our therapeutic program shows evidence of benefit in DFS and OS </plain></SENT>
