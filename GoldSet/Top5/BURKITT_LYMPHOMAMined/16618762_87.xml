<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hereby, we describe the identification of a compound we named cambinol that inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>-dependent deacetylase activity of human SIRT1 and SIRT2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the role of SIRT1 in promoting cell survival during stress, inhibition of SIRT1 activity with cambinol during genotoxic stress leads to hyperacetylation of key stress response proteins and promotes cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of BCL6-expressing Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with cambinol as a single agent induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was accompanied by hyperacetylation of BCL6 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because acetylation inactivates BCL6 and has the opposite effect on the function of p53 and other checkpoint pathways, the antitumor activity of cambinol in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may be accomplished through a combined effect of BCL6 inactivation and checkpoint activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cambinol was well tolerated in mice and inhibited growth of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>-dependent deacetylases may constitute novel anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
