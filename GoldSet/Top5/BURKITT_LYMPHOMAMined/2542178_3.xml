<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific DNase antibodies was measured in the sera of 400 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred sera were positive (greater than or equal to 20) for early antigen diffuse component (EA-D) antibodies, as measured by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred sera were EA-D antibody-negative but had IF IgG titers (greater than 40) to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of the anti-EA-D-positive sera, and 14 of the anti-EA-D-negative sera showed specific inhibition of EBV DNase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of positive male patients (39 years) for DNase antibodies was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the mean age of positive females (27 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 40 patients (29.5%) with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) had EBV DNase-neutralizing antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the level of anti-DNase antibodies and the antibody titer to EA-D or VCA was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the notion that the EBV DNase antibody assay measures an independent index reflecting factual EBV disease </plain></SENT>
