<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there is accumulating evidence that the antitumor effect of anti-Id or several other B cell-reactive antibodies relates to their ability to act as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> rather than conventional effector antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their inhibitors in anti-IgM-induced cell cycle arrest to better understand the mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> dormancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, we have performed in vitro studies with a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Daudi) because its response to anti-Id (or anti-IgM) is similar to that of a BCL1 cell line, more reagents are available, and the results would be particularly pertinent to therapy of human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that cross-linking of membrane IgM on Daudi cells induces an arrest late in G1 and prevents pRb from becoming phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G1 arrest is correlated with an induction of the CDK inhibitor p21 and reduced CDK2 activity, although the level of CDK2 protein was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coprecipitation of CDK2 with p21 in anti-IgM-treated cells and the unchanged level of cyclin E suggest that p21 is responsible for the reduction of CDK2 activity and therefore blockade of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of p21 was not accompanied by changes in p53 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result of the G1 block, cyclin A levels sharply declined by 24 h after anti-IgM treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for involvement of CDK4 or CDK6 in the blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that membrane IgM cross-linking on Daudi cells induces expression of p21 and a subsequent inhibition of the cyclin E-CDK2 kinase complex resulting in a block to pRb phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest late in G1 </plain></SENT>
