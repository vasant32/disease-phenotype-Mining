<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficiency in hENT1 confers resistance to toxicity of these drugs in a variety of model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs have a role in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), this study was undertaken to assess hENT1 abundance in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 cases of NHL of various subtypes and 15 reactive lymph nodes were evaluated for the presence of hENT1 protein using immunohistochemistry applied to frozen tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were considered positive when &gt;or=50% of neoplastic cells showed immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reactive lymph nodes, hENT1 was confined to the germinal centers, whereas mantle zone B-cells and interfollicular T-cells were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In NHL, a relatively high frequency of hENT1 positivity was found in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (63%), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL; 45%), and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In DLCL, 26% of cases were positive for CD10, and CD10-positive DLCL cases were more likely to be hENT1 positive than CD10-negative cases (P=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A lower frequency of hENT1 positivity was found in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (13%) and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (37%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hENT1 was most frequently found in benign and malignant follicular center cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies to assess the value of hENT1 immunostaining in predicting resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> chemotherapy for NHL are warranted </plain></SENT>
