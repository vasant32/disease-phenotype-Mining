<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Native and sialidase- as well as sialidase-beta-galactosidase-treated cells were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method for the quantitative determination of average numbers of binding sites and of apparent affinity constants was flow cytometry with fluorescence-labeled lectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although with native cells there was no significant deviation of the values for virus-transformed cells from those for the parent cells, some differences could be detected after glycosidase treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The general procedure of the combined application of specific glycosidases and the quantitation of sugar-specific lectin binding is recommended as a general strategy for the differentiation of cells with known or putative differences in biological functions </plain></SENT>
