<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B95-8 EBV was inoculated intraperitoneally and intravenously to the mice 6 weeks after transfer of seronegative PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of four mice transferred with PBMC from two EBV-seropositive donors and two of four mice from two EBV-seronegative donors inoculated with EBV developed fatal EBV-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> within 6 to 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were oligoclonal or polyclonal by cytoplasmic immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore no consistent clonal chromosomal abnormalities were shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell lines established from these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed low cloning efficiency in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, latent membrane protein, B-lymphocyte activation antigen (CD23), and cell-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ICAM-1, CD18) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were expressed in the EBV-positive infiltrating lymphoproliferative lesions in each mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> are comparable to lymphoblastoid cell lines immortalized by EBV and are not malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model may be useful for investigating mechanisms responsible for the growing numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> that are occurring in patients with inherited or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
