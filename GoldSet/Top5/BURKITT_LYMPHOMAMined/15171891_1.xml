<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 44 patients (36 men, 8 women; median age 34 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 34%, and diffuse large cell B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 29.5% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>International prognostic index (IPI) was 0-1 in 19 patients (43%), 2 in 12 (27%) and higher than 3 in 13 (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was used in 64% of the patients, radiation therapy in 2% and both in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Criteria for partial response were reached in 13 patients (29%), for complete remission in 2 (4%) and for stabilization in 1 (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine (20%) patients are alive (5 without disease), 22 (50%) died because of NHL, 5 (11%) died because of treatment associated toxicity and 8 died because of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival were 3 months, with a 1-year survival estimate of 24% and a 2-year survival estimate of 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis of prognostic factors, IPI = 0-1 in comparison with IPI = 2-5 (p = 0.000), physical status (PS) &lt; or = 2 (p = 0.021) and absence of B symptoms (p = 0.012) were significant </plain></SENT>
