<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution PCR-based analyses (including denaturing gel electrophoresis and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)) we have compared Ig/TCR gene rearrangements at presentation and relapse in a series of ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These methods allow an unambigous comparison of rearrangements taking into account junctional size and nucleotide sequence information and allow a precise assessment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>V gamma-J gamma and V delta 1-J delta 1 rearrangements were analysed in 12 T-ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VH-JH, V gamma-J gamma, V delta 2-D delta 3 and, in selected cases, DH-JH rearrangements were studied in 14 B-lineage ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Clonal evolution</z:e>, regarding major rearrangements, occurs for at least one of these loci in 2/12 T-ALLs and in 5/14 B-lineage ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Clonal evolution</z:e> is more marked for minor rearrangements than for major ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As shown using SSCP analysis, rearrangements observed at relapse are sometimes found in minor clones at presentation which are therefore selected in vivo by a proliferative advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data, as well as those from the available literature, suggest the use of at least two patient-specific probes to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A general strategy including selected Ig/TCR rearrangements and chromosomal abnormalities as PCR targets is proposed </plain></SENT>
