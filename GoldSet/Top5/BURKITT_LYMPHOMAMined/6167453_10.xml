<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect was observed 1 h after addition of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increase in beta2-microglobulin on the cell surface of IFN-treated cells is not due to a decreased shedding of antigen from the cell surface, nor an "unmasking" of surface antigen, but rather to an increased synthesis of antigen </plain></SENT>
