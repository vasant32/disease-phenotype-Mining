<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a low-dose, seven-day course of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> gave a good response which permitted the pregnancy to be carried to term, with delivery of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results in this patient and a survey of reported cases in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was administered during pregnancy and lactation lead to the conclusions that (1) low-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy is not hazardous to the fetus during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e>; (2) mammary concentration of the drug is too toxic to the infant's bone marrow; and (3) breast-feeding the baby should be suspended during the period the mother is receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
