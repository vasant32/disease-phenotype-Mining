<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case with a germline mutation of the p53 gene develpoing both a non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> could be cured by two operations and combined chemotherapy but 33 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, he suffered from a diffuse, large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of clear rearranged fragments observed with IgH and c-MYC gene probes, we could not diagnose a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was chemoresistant and the patient died of multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was confirmed to have a germline mutation of the p53 gene by analysis of c-DNA from peripheral lymphocytes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of p53 was evident in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were suggestive of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="LFS">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LFS</z:e>), a rare autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome with a germline mutation of p53 gene and diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, but this could not be confirmed in the present case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a de novo mutation could have been involved </plain></SENT>
