<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these cell lines is their high constitutive expression level of the nbl gene, which was originally isolated by virtue of its abundance in a Namalwa Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cell lines which constitutively express nbl at low levels appear not to undergo typical apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in response to Act D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic induction by Act D in cells which normally express nbl at high levels was found in this study to be closely associated with a decline in nbl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, raising the possibility that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could be induced by lowering nbl expression levels in such cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient expression of nbl antisense sequences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells decreased cell viability, and induced typical apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation with nbl antisense oligomers also induced similar features in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells and in another high nb-expressing cell line, Jurkat, but had little effect in HepG2 cells which constitutively express nbl at low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that lowering constitutively high levels of nbl expression can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
