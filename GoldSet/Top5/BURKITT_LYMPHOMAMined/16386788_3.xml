<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TCR genes rearrangements were reported to occur at high frequency in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have analyzed 83 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B-lineage ALL (67 de novo patients and 19 relapses) by PCR analysis for clonal IgH, incomplete TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3) and TCRG rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that clonal cross-lineage TCR rearrangements were associated with more immature immunophenotype (CD34+, CD117+, CyIgM-) of leukemic cells from patients' bone marrow (BM) samples as compared to cell samples without cross-lineage TCR rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>That was equally detected both in de novo and relapsed cases of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low frequency of clonal TCRG rearrangements was associated with expression of E2A/PBX chimeric oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that TCRG and TCRD clonal rearrangements in leukemic B-cells are associated with early stages of their differentiation </plain></SENT>
