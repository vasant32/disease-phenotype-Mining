<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is histologically characterized by a "starry sky" appearance, representing scattered macrophages that have phagocytosed cell debris among proliferating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As is well known, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the neoplastic cells of endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that most of the EBV in B cells is latent, and few virus particles enter the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the histologic relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> stages and the formation of the starry sky pattern in African endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Tissue samples from 44 patients with African endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were examined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) as a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e>, and BamHI H left frame 1 (BHLF1) and BamHI Z EBV replication activator (ZEBRA) as lytic cycle markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, signals for EBER were found in most neoplastic lymphocytes, and in 73% of cases, signals for BHLF1 and/or ZEBRA were recognized in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells within and around the lacunae in starry sky figures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean number of lacunae per unit area in cases positive for lytic cycle markers was significantly higher than that in negative cases (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that EBV-infected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the lytic cycle, which eventually lapse into cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, are phagocytosed prior to their rupture by macrophages that have migrated into the parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We emphasize that transition of EBV-infected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to the lytic cycle is one of the histomorphogenetic factors influencing the formation of starry sky pattern in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
