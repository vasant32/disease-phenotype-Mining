<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>JD118 is a cytotoxic murine IgM mAb with reactivity restricted to a subset of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, some monocytic series cells, and a large percentage of B cell hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specificity was determined on several hundred <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic, hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and tissues, as well as progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>JD118 was able to kill fresh human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the presence of human serum as a complement source with an LD50 of 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this mAb concentration, fewer than 4% of more than 10(5) available target sites were bound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Killing was not affected by changes in antigen expression observed during the cell cycle nor by <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp>-surface targets via antigenic modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity could be achieved with human serum diluted as low as 5%, suggesting that complement <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in vivo should not limit activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autologous human serum could be used effectively as a complement source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The JD118 antigen target has not been identified, but it appears to be a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of antigen expression on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells in vitro resulted in antigen-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> becoming positive and thus targets for JD118 killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The restricted expression, potent cytotoxic characteristics, and potential for up-regulation of its antigen make JD118 a possible candidate for ex vivo autologous bone marrow purging and in vivo therapeutic trials in patients with B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
