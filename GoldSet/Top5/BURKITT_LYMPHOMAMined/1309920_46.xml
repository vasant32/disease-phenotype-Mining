<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Described here is an initial mapping of the regions of Zta involved in activating transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the amino-terminal 153 amino acids of Zta are important for activity, and in particular the region from residues 28 to 78 appears to be critical for Zta function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, other features of Zta may be important for activity since a Gal4-Zta chimeric protein, generated by fusing the amino-terminal 167 residues of Zta to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator Gal4, transactivated a minimal promoter containing one upstream Gal4 binding site but was unable to exhibit synergistic transactivation when assayed with a reporter containing five upstream Gal4 binding sites </plain></SENT>
