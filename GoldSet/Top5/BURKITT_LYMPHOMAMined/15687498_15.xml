<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is invariably associated with chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the c-myc proto-oncogene with regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) or light chain loci resulting in the deregulation of c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the enhancer elements mediating c-myc deregulation in vivo remain largely unidentified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the IgH 3'-enhancers in c-myc deregulation, we used gene targeting to generate knock-in mice in which four DNase I hypersensitive regions from the murine IgH 3'-region were integrated into the 5'-region of the c-myc locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgH 3'-enhancers induced the up-regulation of c-myc expression specifically in B cells of IgH-3'-E-myc mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After approximately 10 months, the mice developed a Burkitt-like B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the phenotype of B220+, IgM+, and IgD(low) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were of clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of a rapidly expanding population of B cells in the spleen and bone marrow of young knock-in mice at 2-4 months of age was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Premalignant splenic B cells of knock-in mice showed higher spontaneous and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>; however, malignant B cells were more resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The p53-ARF-Mdm2 pathway was disabled in half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined, in most cases through Mdm2 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although c-myc expression was increased in premalignant B cells, the promoter shift from P2 to P1 was observed only in malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrate that the IgH 3'-enhancers play an important role in c-myc deregulation and B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
