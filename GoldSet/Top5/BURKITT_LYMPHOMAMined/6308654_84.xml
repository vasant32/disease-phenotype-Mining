<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether the translocated and the untranslocated human c-myc oncogenes of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are equally or differentially expressed in host mouse B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in somatic cell hybrids between mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cells and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with either the t(8;14) or the t(2;8) chromosome translocation were determined by using the nuclease S1 protection procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although both the human parental lines and the hybrid cells carrying the translocated c-muc oncogene expressed high levels of human specific c-myc transcripts, the hybrid cells carrying the untranslocated c-myc gene on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 8 did not contain human specific c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the translocated human c-myc oncogene has escaped the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcriptional control to which the untranslocated c-myc gene remains subjected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This interpretation is also supported by the finding that the expression of the c-myc genes of lymphoblastoid cells and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells are repressed when they are transferred into a mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of the translocated c-myc oncogene to escape the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcriptional control occurring in B cells may be important for the expression of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in mouse and man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also transferred the Burkitt 14q+ chromosome carrying a translocated c-myc oncogene into mouse LM-TK- fibroblasts and studied the levels of human c-myc transcripts in the hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the levels of human c-myc transcripts in the fibroblast hybrids are dramatically decreased in comparison to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> hybrids, we conclude that the levels of transcripts of the translocated c-myc oncogene depend on the differentiated state of the cells harboring the translocated chromosome </plain></SENT>
