<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A trend toward higher CEC values was observed on days 7 and 14 after transplant, and differences versus controls were highly significant on day 21 (P = 0.0061) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was found between CEC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume (r, 0.942; P = 0.004) and between CEC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-generated VEGF (r, 0.669; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mice given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, most of the circulating apoptotic cells were hematopoietic and not endothelial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in mice given endostatin, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the increase in apoptotic cells was in the endothelial cell compartment </plain></SENT>
