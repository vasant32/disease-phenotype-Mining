<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that recruitment of marrow-derived vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(+) (VEGFR-1(+)) proangiogenic hematopoietic progenitors contributes instructively and structurally to neoangiogenesis in mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated whether stromal incorporation of CD68(+) hemangiogenic cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) (alpha-SMA(+)) stromal cells correlates with neoangiogenesis and progression in human non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Spatial localizations of vascular and stromal cells expressing CD34, VEGFR-1, alpha-SMA, and CD68 were examined by immunohistochemistry in 42 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e>), and compared with benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, there was a profound increase in recruitment of CD68(+) cells and VEGFR-1(+) neovessels in aggressive subtypes (including those transformed from indolent subtypes), where CD68(+) cells were localized to the perivascular region of neovessels as well as the stromal compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The perivascular CD68(+) cells expressed VEGFR-1 and VEGF-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a diffuse increase in alpha-SMA incorporation throughout the stromal compartment of indolent subtype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> compared with the scant perivascular pattern in aggressive subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was no correlation between CD34(+) microvessel density and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histologic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heightened stromal hemangiogenesis as marked by infiltration of proangiogenic VEGFR-1(+)CD68(+)VEGF-A(+) cells and their paracrine cross-talk with neovasculature appears to be a distinct feature of aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, providing novel targets for antiangiogenic therapy, whereas alpha-SMA(+) stromal vascular network may be differentially targeted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1302547" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">CLL/SLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
