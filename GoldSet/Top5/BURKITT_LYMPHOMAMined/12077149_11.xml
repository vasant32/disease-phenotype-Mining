<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using synthetic (-)-doliculide, we found that the compound arrests cells at the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle by interfering with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> actin assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stress fibers disappeared and were replaced by multiple clumps of apparently aggregated F-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These effects of (-)-doliculide on cells were essentially identical to those obtained with jasplakinolide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Like jasplakinolide, (-)-doliculide caused the hyperassembly of purified actin into F-actin as measured both fluorometrically and by centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, (-)-doliculide, like jasplakinolide, readily displaced a fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8040">phalloidin</z:chebi> derivative from actin polymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In these biochemical assays (-)-doliculide and jasplakinolide were quantitatively virtually identical in their behaviors </plain></SENT>
