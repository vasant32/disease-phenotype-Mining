<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Primary human amnion cell monolayers which had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi>, washed, and then inoculated with sonicated cells of the EB3 line of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells developed foci of transformed amnion cells 7 to 14 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When either the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> or the sonicate was omitted, no significant transformation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The foci consisted of enlarging mounds of rapidly dividing cells, which upon subculturing continued their high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51068">miotic</z:chebi> activity; and strains or lines of the transformed amnion cells were thus readily established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modal number of chromosomes in such lines was 65 instead of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human amnions yielded cells transformable by EB3 cell sonicate, as determined by direct comparisions using the same cultural conditions and testing with the same fresh sonicate preparation in the same experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, it appeared that only about 40 to 50% of the amnions yielded transformable cell monolayers; the rest gave monolayers apprently completely refractory to the transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transformed amnion cells contained nuclear and cytoplasmic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen(s), as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EB3 cell sonicate also caused the appearance of rapidly growing transformed cell foci on secondary rat embryo cell monolayers which had been sensitized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcium in the cell maintenance medium decreased the number of transformed foci found, both on the human and on the rat cell monlayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sonicates of cultured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human leucocytes had no such transforming activity for either the human or the rat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The transforming agent in EB3 cell sonicate was completely destructible by either deoxyribonuclease or trypsin, but not by ribonuclease, and was not neutralizable by anti-EBV serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The simplest interpretation of these results is that the transforming agent is part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the EBV DNA plus some necessary protein, with both the DNA and the protein accessible to hydrolytic enzyme action </plain></SENT>
