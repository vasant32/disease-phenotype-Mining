<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B43 murine monoclonal antibody does not react with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunotoxin bound to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines that were tested but not to human peripheral blood T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of antibody-toxin conjugate to inhibit human lymphoblast cell lines was checked in a clonogenic assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunotoxin in the presence of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> elicited 5.8 logs of killing of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficient inhibition of clonogenic growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells was not affected by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunotoxin was not very toxic to pluripotent stem cells; less than 50% of the stem cells were lost under conditions where 5.6 logs of clonogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were eliminated from a 100-fold excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, when assayed by long-term human bone marrow cultures, immunotoxin treatment did not result in a significant loss of pluripotent precursor cells </plain></SENT>
