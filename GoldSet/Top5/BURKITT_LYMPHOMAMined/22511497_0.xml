<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A minority of patients with adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> who relapse are rescued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this population-based study was to assess the results of reinduction treatment and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients in second complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 2003-2007, 76 adults (&lt;66 years) with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> excluded) were prospectively reported to The Swedish Adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>Acute Leukemia</z:hpo> Registry and later evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reinduction with: (i) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>); (ii) fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, pegylated-asparaginase plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG-Asp); and (iii) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3077">betamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (ABCDV) resulted in complete remission in 6/9 (67%), 10/16 (63%) and 9/21 (43%) of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed during second complete remission in 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis regarding overall survival after relapse revealed that age over 35 years at diagnosis and relapse within 18 months were negative prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 22% (95% CI: 13-32) and 15% (95% CI: 7-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients less than 35 years at diagnosis who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in second remission, ten (53%) are still alive at a median of 5.5 years (range, 4.2-8.3) after relapse, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over 35 years old at diagnosis have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the treatment of choice for young adults with relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both (i) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and (ii) fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, pegylated-asparaginase plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor seem effective as reinduction treatments and should be further evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>New salvage strategies are needed, especially for patients over 35 years old at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
