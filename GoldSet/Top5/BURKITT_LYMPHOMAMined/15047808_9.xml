<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), a direct transcriptional activator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular genes, is required for EBV-induced B-cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional role of conserved regions within the amino terminus of the protein preceding the poly-proline region has yet to be fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether the EBNA2 amino-terminal 30 amino acid residues, containing evolutionarily conserved region 1, are required for stimulating <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular gene expression necessary for B-cell transformation in a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcomplementation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that these residues are required for its ability to induce LMP-1 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), to stimulate LMP-1 promoter reporter plasmids in transient-cotransfection assays, and to rescue LCL growth following inactivation of endogenous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBNA2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion of amino acid residues 3 to 30 also impaired its ability to self-associate in coimmunoprecipitation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that EBNA2 residues 3 to 30 comprise an essential domain required for induction of LMP-1 expression and, consequently, for maintenance of the immortalized phenotype of LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability to self-associate into dimers or multimers conferred by this domain may be an important mechanism for these effects </plain></SENT>
