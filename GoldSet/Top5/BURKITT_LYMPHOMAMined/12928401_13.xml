<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This capture is thought to require effector cell activation by surface recognition of stimulatory ligand(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, spontaneous synaptic transfers between homotypic lymphoid cells has never been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that without adding Ag, resting healthy lymphoid cells and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines are inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, however, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines including the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi continuously uptake patches of autologous cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This intercellular transfer does not involve cytosol molecules or exosomes, but requires cell contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In homotypic Daudi cell conjugates, this occurs through immunological synapses, involves constitutive protein kinase C and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activity and strongly increases upon B cell receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, spontaneous homosynaptic transfer may reflect the hitherto unsuspected autoreactivity of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
