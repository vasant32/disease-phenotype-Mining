<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed that each one of 100-, 67-, and 46-kDa 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5(A)-synthetase) proteins had a unique expression pattern in different phases of the cell cycle which was different from the expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase proteins in exponentially growing Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle-dependent changes in the overall levels of expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase proteins correlated well with the induction of expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as well as the appearance of IFN stimulatory gene factor-3 and expression and activation of p91 in cells released from the G1/S block in the absence of exogenous IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, cells from the G1/S phase exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-1 and Tyk-2 kinases and p91 by IFN-alpha as compared with asynchronized cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced stimulation of activation of JAK-1, Tyk-2, and p91 by IFN-alpha was progressively reduced from G1/S to G2/M to pass G2/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that the levels of constitutive and inducible expression of IFN-alpha-inducible genes, activation of p91, and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-1 and Tyk-2 kinases are differentially influenced by the state of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
