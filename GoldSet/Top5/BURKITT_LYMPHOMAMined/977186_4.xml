<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied peripheral blood lymphocyte populations, defined in terms of their E and EAC' rosette-forming capacity in patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total lymphocyte counts were reduced in patients compared to controls (p less than 0.005), and correlated with clinical stage and disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting patients with Stage D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had the lowest levels, while patients in remission for at least 18 months had total lymphocyte counts similar to those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute numbers of both E and EAC' rosette-forming cells (RFC) were reduced, compared to controls, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-bearing patients (p less than 0.0005 for both E and EAC' RFC) and also, to a lesser extent, in patients in remission (p less than 0.025 and less than 0.05 for E and EAC' RFC respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of E RFC a significant reduction was present even when patients in remission for over 18 months were considered alone (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-RFC were present in similar numbers in patients and controls, so that the reduction in total lymphocyte count can be accounted for entirely by the reduced numbers of RFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As anticipated by this, percentages of RFC were also reduced in patients compared to controls, EAC' RFC to a lesser extent than E RFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-RFC percentages were correspondingly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e>-bearing patients had significantly impaired PHA responses and cutaneous reactivity, which correlated significantly with very low levels of RFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for these results is that immunoreactive lymphocytes are sequestered within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the immunosuppression observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-bearing patients, and would also result in difficulty in detecting even a powerful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific immune reaction by means of an assay dependent upon the participation of peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
