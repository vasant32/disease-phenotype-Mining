<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine kinases causing the abnormal phosphorylation of intracellular proteins have been shown to contribute to oncogenic transformation in a number of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological staining of routine biopsy sections for increased levels of phosphotyrosine may therefore provide a simple means of screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> containing activated tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used to immunostain a cell line and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biopsies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> known to contain the activated anaplastic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and other neoplastic tissues were also immunostained for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>) cell line carrying the (2;5) translocation, which creates the activated nucleophosmin-anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> kinase (NPM-ALK) tyrosine kinase, was strongly labelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routine tissue biopsies from five cases of ALK-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e> were also strongly positive for phosphotyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characteristic granular cytoplasmic labelling pattern for phosphotyrosine observed in a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (expressing full length ALK kinase) was identical to that obtained using an ALK-specific antibody, thus confirming that labelling for phosphotyrosine in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells reflects the presence of an activated kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues were stained, there was little or no labelling for phosphotyrosine, but stronger labelling was seen in other cells and tissues; for example, endothelial cells and some <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whilst the strong labelling for phosphotyrosine observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is due to the presence of activated ALK, the strong staining of some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells presumably represents physiologically active kinases and this should be taken into account when interpreting the immunostaining of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of this method, however, means that it offers a new rapid approach to the screening of large numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> for the presence of aberrant tyrosine kinase activation, particularly if they arise from tissues which normally contain only background levels of phosphotyrosine </plain></SENT>
