<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maximum virus titers were reached 2--4 days after inoculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease in percentage of viable cells in the infected cultures but a considerable fraction of cells was not destroyed by virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A persistent low grade replication of virus was observed and demonstrable during 56 days after inoculation in one LBL cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presumably a small fraction of cells supporting virus replication is continuously recruited from refractory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No virus propagation was demonstrable in 4 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
