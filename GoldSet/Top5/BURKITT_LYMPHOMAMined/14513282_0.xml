<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are more frequent in diffuse large B cell (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to analyse the presence and distribution of BCL-6 gene mutations in a large series of primary bone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PBL), a rare extranodal presentation of NHL frequently associated with diffuse large cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three cases of PBL were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected with non-radioisotopic polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and visualized with fluorescent cycle sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among stage I(E) PBL, there were 30 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and one each of follicular, anaplastic large cell and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stage II(E) PBL included six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and one lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas within stage IV PBL there were 12 DLBCL and one Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (28%) displayed mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nine cases there were more than one BCL-6 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> displayed mutations (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutations included single base-pair substitutions (16 transitions and ten transversions) and a single point insertion (ins A 427-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mutations resulted lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> of the PBL category than in the majority of other extranodal large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of mutations was higher in stage I(E) PBL than in more advanced stages of the disease (II(E) + IV) ( p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results reinforce the observation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> included in the clinical category of PBL </plain></SENT>
