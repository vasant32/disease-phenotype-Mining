<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By gene transfer, LMP induces the expression of vimentin and B-cell activation antigens in EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now expressed LMP in an EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi, which does not express any LMP or vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these Daudi transfectants, LMP still formed plasma membrane patches in the absence of vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LMP did not resist nonionic detergent extraction in Daudi cells as it does in vimentin-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP still retained functional activity as judged by induction of B-cell activation antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that LMP can form plasma membrane patches and induce B-lymphocyte activation independent of vimentin association </plain></SENT>
