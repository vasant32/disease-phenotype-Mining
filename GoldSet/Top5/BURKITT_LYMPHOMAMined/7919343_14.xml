<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a T-cell-derived cytokine that displays homology with IL-4 and shares some of its biologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of IL-13 on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B-cell precursors (BCP) and their malignant counterparts in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-13 inhibited growth of CD19+ slg- <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BCP cultured in the presence or absence of bone marrow accessory stromal cells and IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, IL-13 inhibited proliferation of blasts isolated from leukemic patients and cells from established BCP-ALL lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences were observed in a number of cases with respect to growth inhibition in response to IL-13 and IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the expression of IL-13 and IL-4 receptors in B-cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth-inhibition by IL-13 could be reverted by anti-IL-4 receptor antibody, indicating that the IL-13 and IL-4 binding chains can be closely associated on BCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further showed that the inhibitory effect of IL-13 results from decreased cell-cycle activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, whereas IL-13 induced CD23 expression on BCP-ALL cells, it did not promote differentiation into slg+ B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
