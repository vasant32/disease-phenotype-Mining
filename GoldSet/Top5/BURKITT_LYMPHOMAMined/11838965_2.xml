<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B-cell protein CD19 and the interferon-alpha receptor possess verotoxin-like amino acid sequences in their extracellular domains, and CD77 has been shown to function in CD19-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and interferon-induced growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi, is similar to germinal center B-cells in their expression of CD77, CD19 and MHC class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the multiple sequence alignment program, ClustalW, we have identified a verotoxin-like amino acid sequence on the beta-chain of human and murine MHC class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding of CD77 at this site could modulate the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding properties of these MHC class II molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts, we found that CD77-positive Daudi cells have higher levels of HLA-D proteins than VT500 cells, a Daudi-derived CD77-deficient mutant cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MHC class II-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and surface expression are similar in the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CD77 could play a functional or regulatory role in MHC class II-mediated functions specifically relating to antigen presentation by B-cells to T helper cells </plain></SENT>
