<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (PTLD) derive from antigen-experienced B-cells and represent a major complication of solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized usage, mutation frequency and mutation pattern of immunoglobulin variable (IGV) gene rearrangements in 50 PTLD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301361" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polymorphic PTLD</z:e>, n=10; diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, n=35; and Burkitt/Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among PTLD yielding clonal IGV amplimers, a functional IGV heavy chain (IGHV) rearrangement was found in 40/50 (80.0%) cases, whereas a potentially functional IGV light chain rearrangement was identified in 36/46 (78.3%) PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By combining IGHV and IGV light chain rearrangements, 10/50 (20.0%) PTLD carried crippling mutations, precluding expression of a functional B-cell receptor (BCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed detectable expression of IG light chains in only 18/43 (41.9%) PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Failure to detect a functional IGV rearrangement associated with lack of IGV expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that a large fraction of PTLD arise from germinal centre (GC)-experienced B-cells that display impaired BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since a functional BCR is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell survival during GC transit, PTLD development may implicate rescue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and expansion of B-cells that have failed the GC reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of IGV loci inactivation appears to be a peculiar feature of PTLD among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-associated lymphoproliferations </plain></SENT>
