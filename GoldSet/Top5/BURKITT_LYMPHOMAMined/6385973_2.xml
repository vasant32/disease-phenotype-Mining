<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular DNA polymerases of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line (P3HR-1) were found to be greatly induced by treatment of the cells with 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) at a concentration which induces Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early antigen (EA) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the DNA Polymerases alpha, beta and gamma in P3HR-1 cells increased 7-9 fold by exposure of the cells to IUdR (25 micrograms/ml) for 3 days, while the EBV-coded DNA polymerase activity in the cell remained undetectable under the assay conditions employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the same culture conditions with IUdR, EA-positive P3HR-1 cells increased to 16.6% which was much higher than that of the non-treated control cells (0.32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, another Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji, had very low incidence (1.27%) of EA induction by IUdR-treatment and the level of DNA polymerase activities remained almost unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From these results it seems that the increase in DNA polymerase activity during the treatment of P3HR-1 cells with IUdR is closely related to high incidence of EA expression in these Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the finding has revealed yet unknown effect of IUdR on cultured cells and provides a useful tool to obtain a large quantity of the induced cellular DNA polymerases from the P3HR-1 and KB cells </plain></SENT>
