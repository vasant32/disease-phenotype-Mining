<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the upstream regulatory sequences are conserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MHC class II genes, multiple base pair changes are found, even within the essential X box region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> class II X boxes reveals differential binding between two transcription factors known to interact with the X box region, regulatory factor X and X2 box-binding protein (RFX and X2BP) of the HLA-DRA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data presented a paradox with regard to the coordinate regulation of the class II genes if the factors though to regulate the HLA-DRA gene do not bind to the homologous sequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> class II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous results suggested that cooperative interactions between the DNA binding proteins may be the key to understanding this paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here RFX/X2BP/DNA complexes were formed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> class II isotypes regardless of the ability of the X box region to bind either factor individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further determine the role of the interactions between the X and Y factors, multiprotein/DNA complexes containing RFX, X2BP, NF-Y, and X-Y box DNA of the DRA and DRB genes were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This quaternary complex was extremely stable to competitor DNA, with a half-life &gt; 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the conserved X and Y boxes of class II genes function similarly and define a single multiprotein regulatory complex for class II expression in B cells </plain></SENT>
