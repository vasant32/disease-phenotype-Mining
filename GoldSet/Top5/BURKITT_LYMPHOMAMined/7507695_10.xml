<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By a combination of high-resolution chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis, we have examined the nature of aberrations affecting chromosome 6 in 7 previously established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines exhibited the characteristic translocations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>; 5 had t(8;14)(q24;q32) and 2 had t(8;22)(q24;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three cell lines had deletions of 6q; 3 others had rearrangements affecting 6q, whereas one cell line had apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of the three deletions established that they were interstitial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LOH analysis with probes mapped to the 6q26-27 region confirmed the sub-telomeric interstitial deletion in cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-108, which had a del(6)(q23q27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> informative loci mapped to 6q26-27 (5/7) were deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-74, which had no apparent cytogenetic abnormality in chromosome 6, thus documenting a sub-microscopic deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data define the cytogenetic and molecular limits of 6q deletions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and are consistent with our previous demonstration of LOH analysis of the site of a candidate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene in the 6q25-27 region </plain></SENT>
