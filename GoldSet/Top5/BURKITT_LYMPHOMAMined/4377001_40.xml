<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transformed cells in the co-cultures were of mixed origin with foetal cells usually predominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing antisera to EB virus markedly reduced or abolished the incidence of transformation in IM leukocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was not due to cytotoxicity and followed the pattern seen with cultures where transformation was known to depend on the inter-cellular transfer of infectious EB virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that EB virus is harboured in peripheral lymphocytes of IM patients as a non-productive unexpressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> which is activated to produce virus in vitro, the particles released then infecting neighbouring cells to give transformed lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences between this mechanism and the one whereby lines arise in culture from malignant cells of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are considered, and their significance is discussed </plain></SENT>
