<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have presented data on determining proliferative activity using Ki-67 immunostaining, and demonstrated that an admixture of reactive cells could exert significant influence on the assessments of proliferative indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed an experimental approach, which makes it possible to select neoplastic cells from the overall lymphoid population and to assess their proliferative activity - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell proliferative indices </plain></SENT>
