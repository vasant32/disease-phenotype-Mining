<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased oxygen species production has often been cited as a mechanism determining synergism on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and growth inhibition effects of <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi>-combined drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the net effect of drug combination may not be easily anticipated solely from available knowledge of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the combined effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">sodium arsenite</z:chebi> with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MG132, and the anti-leukaemic agent CAPE, on growth-inhibition and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid leukaemic cells U937 and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Raji cells, by the Chou-Talalay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition we explored the association of cytotoxic effect of drugs with changes in intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> (O₂⁻) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that combined arsenite+MG132 produced low levels of O₂⁻ at 6h and 24h after exposure and were synergic on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induction in U937 cells over the whole dose range, although the combination was antagonistic on growth inhibition effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to a constant non-cytotoxic dose of 80μM <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> together with arsenite+MG132 changed synergism on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to antagonism at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effect levels while increasing O₂⁻ levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arsenite+<z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> also resulted in antagonism with increased O₂⁻ levels in U937 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Raji cells, arsenite+MG132 also produced low levels of O₂⁻ at 6h and 24h but resulted in antagonism on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the combination arsenite+CAPE showed high levels of O₂⁻ production at 6h and 24 h post exposure but resulted in antagonism over cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and growth inhibition effects in U937 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that synergism between arsenite and MG132 in U937 cells is negatively associated to O₂⁻ levels at early time points after exposure </plain></SENT>
