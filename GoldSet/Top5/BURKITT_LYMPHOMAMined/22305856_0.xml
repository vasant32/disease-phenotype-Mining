<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the metabolic management of a 6 year old boy with classical PKU who was diagnosed with stage III intraabdominal Burkit's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and underwent surgical resection and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The metabolic control during chemotherapy was achieved by the use of parenteral custom made amino acid solution and pro-active adjustment of intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the 94 obtained plasma phenylalanine (Phe) levels, 18.4% were above our clinic's recommended upper limit (360 μmol/L, 6 mg/dL) while 52.7% of Phe levels were below the recommended lower limit (120 μmol/L, 2 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phe levels above recommended range were associated with low caloric/protein intake, while levels below recommended range reflected the difficulty in achieving the full prescribed Phe intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend early institution of custom made amino acid solution with maximum amino acid content and caloric intake to provide optimal phenylalanine control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of phenylalanine via regular intravenous amino acid solution may assist in avoiding low Phe levels when prescribed intake is compromised due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and other disease related illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of custom made, phenylalanine free amino acid solution proved beneficial in the management of blood phenylalanine levels in a PKU patient during chemotherapy for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
