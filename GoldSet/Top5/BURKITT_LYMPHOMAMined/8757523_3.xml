<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This translocation is very closely associated with a pre-B phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>t(14;18) is associated with follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and is characterized by over-expression of the bcl-2 oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of ALL in an adult with a mature B-cell immunophenotype and a single abnormal cell line with a complex karyotype showing both t(1;19) and t(14;18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reports of this phenomenon have been published previously and molecular analysis, where performed, showed the E2A gene was not rearranged, suggesting the t(1;19) was a molecular variant of the established translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, molecular analysis of our case demonstrated expression of the E2A/PBX1 fusion transcript typically associated with t(1;19) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> but showed it to be present at an extremely low level, despite the abnormal karyotype being found in the majority of metaphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of bcl-2 expression showed a significant up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A down-regulation of the E2A/PBX1 hybrid gene as a consequence of the enhanced expression of bcl-2 may be a possible mechanism for this finding </plain></SENT>
