<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made when a cervical lymph-node biopsy specimen revealed massive proliferation of immature B-cells with starry-sky histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These lymph-node cells were characterised by a translocation between chromosomes 10 and 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were approximately 9 EBV genome-equivalents per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most cells were positive for nuclear antigen (EBNA); early antigen (EA) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV was supported by finding that the cell-free lymph-node extract transformed cord-blood lymphocytes into EBNA-positive blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of EA-positive and VCA-positive cells increased rapidly in culture for 24 h, then the positive cells degenerated rapidly and completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells also contained numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-type virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The child improved considerably with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment and has been in remission for 2 years </plain></SENT>
