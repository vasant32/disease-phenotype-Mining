<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody (Rituximab) directed against the B-cell surface antigen, CD20, is increasingly used as a therapy for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CD20 is expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature B cells and hence is not a specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CD70 is expressed on highly activated lymphocytes as well as on many B-cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but is not expressed on the great majority of B cells and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have explored the potential utility of anti-CD70 monoclonal antibodies for treatment of CD70+ EBV+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using two Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines (Raji and Jijoye) that express surface CD70 and a CD70- Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line (Akata), we show that two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD70 allow rabbit and human complement to kill EBV+ B cells in a CD70-dependent manner in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the absence of complement, neither anti-CD70 antibody induced in vitro killing of CD70+ cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, i.p. injection of anti-CD70 antibodies also inhibited the growth of CD70+ Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice but did not inhibit the growth of CD70- Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-CD70 antibodies may be useful for the treatment of CD70+ B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
