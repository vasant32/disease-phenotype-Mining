<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that activates transcription of cellular genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcription activation by Myc proteins is regulated by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the transactivation domain and by complex formation with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>-related protein p107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, missense mutations within the c-Myc transactivation domain have been found with high frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that mutant c-Myc proteins derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines are resistant to inhibition by p107, thus providing a rationale for the increased oncogenic activity of these mutant c-Myc proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that these mutant c-Myc proteins resist down-modulation by p107 because they lack cyclin A-cdk2-dependent phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we have examined three different Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> mutant c-Myc proteins found in primary Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one mutant c-Myc protein detected in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four have an unaltered ability to activate transcription and are sensitive to inhibition of transactivation by p107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide evidence that down-modulation of c-Myc transactivation by p107 does not require phosphorylation of the c-Myc transactivation domain by cyclin A-cdk2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that escape from p107-induced suppression is not a general consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated c-Myc mutations, suggesting that other mechanisms exist to deregulate c-Myc function </plain></SENT>
