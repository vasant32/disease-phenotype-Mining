<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Characteristics of children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> have not been described in Uganda before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We reviewed records at Uganda <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (UCI) for years 1994-2004, to compare clinical features and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in children who are HIV positive and negative (HIV+, HIV-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As statistical methods we used Student's t-test, Chi-square and Kaplan-Meier's to compare both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,462 records of children retrieved, 228 met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed (158 HIV-, 70 HIV+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 139 (61%) males and 89 (39%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 6.9 years (HIV+ 6.7, HIV- 7.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-one cases (75%) had facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (HIV+ 71.4%, HIV- 76.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HIV positive children presented significantly with extrafacial disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> 67%, hepatic masses 51%, and thoracic masses 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presentation with advanced stage disease occurred more frequently in HIV positive patients compared to HIV negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment response rates to chemotherapy were similar irrespective of HIV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, overall survival was poorer in HIV positive patients with a median survival of 11.79 months (P-value &lt; 0.000, 95% CI 8.65-14.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Uganda presents frequently with facial disease irrespective of HIV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However HIV+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> also presents commonly with extra facial sites, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is no difference in response to treatment with chemotherapy, but HIV+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients have poorer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is need for further characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in Uganda to understand the role of HIV in disease process and outcome </plain></SENT>
