<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified proteins that are involved in anti-IgM antibody-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> using a subclone of the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated proteins were detected by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on a micropreparative scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein patterns from apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells showed differences in approximately 80 spots including protein modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the predominantly altered proteins was performed by internal Edman microsequencing and/or by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was significantly improved by using new micropreparative high resolution two-dimensional gels employing high protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-associated proteins were identified: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, hnRNP C1/C2, FUSE-binding protein, dUTPase, lymphocyte-specific protein LSP1, UV excision repair protein RAD23 homologue B (HHR23B), 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (L10E), heterochromatin protein 1 homologue alpha (HP1alpha), nucleolin, lamin, neutral calponin, and actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fragmentation of actin, hnRNP A1, hnRNP C1/C2, 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0, lamin, and nucleolin could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi>, a selective irreversible inhibitor of CPP32 (caspase 3) </plain></SENT>
