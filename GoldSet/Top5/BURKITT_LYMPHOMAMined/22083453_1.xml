<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel anticancer mechanism of catfish (Silurus asotus) egg lectin (SAL) was found to occur via the down-regulation of the membrane transopter protein, MRP1 (multidrug resistance associate protein-1) on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells through Gb3(<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>α1-4Galβ1-4Glc)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although SAL did not influence the viability of the cells directly, only 10 and 100 ng/mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, respectively induced anticancer effects when the lectin was applied in conjunction with these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These phenomena were specifically inhibited by the co-presence of the α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28053">melibiose</z:chebi>, which is a strong haptenic sugar of SAL that mimicks Gb3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of expression regulation of the transporter proteins on the cells surface was investigated through the examination of the binding between SAL and Gb3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> by immunological and molecular biological procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR data showed that MRP1 was more highly expressed when compared to another ATP-binding cassette family, multi-drug resistant protein and the expression levels of MRP1 on the cells were specifically dose- and time-dependently depleted by the addition of SAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were also evaluated by immunological procedures using FACS and western-blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> coding a part of MRP1 was transfected to Raji cells to knock down the protein, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was increased by 10% when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> was administered at a concentration as low as 10 ng/mL compared to non-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that SAL possesses the potential to enhance the anticancer activites of low-concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> by the down-regulating the MRP1 gene expression to inhibit the multidrug resistance by binding to the target ligand Gb3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi> on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
