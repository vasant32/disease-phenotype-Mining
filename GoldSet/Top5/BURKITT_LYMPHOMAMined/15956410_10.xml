<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Establishment of latently infected cell lines from primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (PEL) presently is the most efficient system for the propagation of clinical strains of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a new approach to culture productively replicating HHV-8 from patient samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A BJAB-derived B-cell line, BBF, was found to retain HHV-8 longer, to support the latent and lytic replication programs, and to produce transmissible virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 24 HHV-8-seropositive renal transplant recipients were used to infect BBF cells, and replicating virus was detected in cultures from 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BBF cells infected with saliva strains showed a highly productive profile regardless of the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, which confirms that infectious HHV-8 can be present in saliva and also suggests that saliva strains may exhibit a high tropism for B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we established an in vitro system that efficiently detects HHV-8 in samples with low <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> loads and that produces infectious progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BBF cells can be used to propagate HHV-8 from different biological samples as well as to clarify important issues related to virus-cell interactions in a context distinct from endothelial and PEL-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
