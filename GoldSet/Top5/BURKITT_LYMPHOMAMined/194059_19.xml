<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The circular EBV DNA in three cell lines obtained by transformation of human umbilical cord blood leukocytes with a strain of EBV originally derived from 883L was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As estimated from sedimentation velocity data and electron microscopy, the circular EBV DNA molecules are 10 to 15% smaller than either the circular EBV DNA previously found intracellularly in several other types of EBV-transformed cells or the linear EBV DNA present extracellularly in virus particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EBV-transformed cord blood cell lines studied here differed from other EBV-transformed cells in that integrated virus DNA sequences could not be detected </plain></SENT>
