<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daudi-IRF4 expressed IRF4 in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> (inducible expression), and Raji-IRF4 constitutively expressed an IRF4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor chimeric protein, which was activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression or activation of IRF4 resulted in growth inhibition accompanied by accumulation of cells in G0/G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of the plasma cell markers CD38 and CD138 and downregulation of the germinal center cell marker B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 6 (BCL6) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for BCL6 and paired box gene 5 (PAX5) were decreased and those for B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (BLIMP1)/PR domain containing 1 (PRDM1) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were increased, which corresponds to the characteristic changes in transcription factor expression in B cells differentiating toward plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Impairment in proliferation and differentiation toward plasma cells induced by IRF4 were not inhibited by enforced expression of BCL6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IRF4 inhibits cell cycle progression of germinal center B cell-derived Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and induces terminal differentiation toward plasma cells through mechanisms independent of BCL6 downregulation </plain></SENT>
