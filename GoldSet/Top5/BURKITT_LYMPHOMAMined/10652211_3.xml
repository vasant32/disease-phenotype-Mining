<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The IL-4Ralpha contains the I4R motif which binds to the phosphotyrosine binding domain of several adaptor proteins, including IRS-1/2 and Shc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the involvement of IRS-1/2 in IL-4-induced PI3-kinase activation is known, there is little information on the role of Shc in IL-4 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found the preferential utilization of Shc by the IL-4Ralpha in a human Burkitt's B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, DND39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-4 induced the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with the IL-4Ralpha, whereas no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-4-induced germline epsilon promoter activation was enhanced by overexpression of Shc and was inhibited by truncated Shc lacking the collagen-homologous domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further found the association of Shc with PLCgamma1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although direct tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 was not detectable, the amount of PLCgamma1 coprecipitable with anti-phosphotyrosine was increased after IL-4 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Shc can function as an adaptor protein of the IL-4Ralpha and mediate the germline epsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
