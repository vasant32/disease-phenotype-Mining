<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients had a (8;14) translocation and 2 a (2;8) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No (8;22) translocation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients (41%), the t(8;14) was the only chromosome rearrangement whereas in the 18 remaining cases (59%), the t(8;14) or t(2;8) was associated with other numerical or structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes 1, 7 and 6 were rearranged in 10, 8, and 5 patients, respectively, usually in translocations, duplications, deletions (chromosome 6), or isochromosome of the long arm (chromosomes 1 or 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of these additional rearrangements is discussed with regard to previously published reports and the chromosome localization of oncogenes </plain></SENT>
