<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: As part of a search for optimal conditions for radioimmunotherapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, rituximab was labeled with 2 different specific activities of 131I and immunoreactivity was comparatively measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Labeling was performed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine T</z:chebi> using as starting conditions 185 MBq of 131I per 1 mg and per 5 mg of antibody for labelings A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six comparative labelings were performed over a period of 10 mo with similar efficacy and purified by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-exchange chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity was determined immediately after labeling in parallel assays using different concentrations of fresh Raji and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared at maximal observed specific binding on 10(7) cells and after extrapolation to infinite antigen excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis was performed to predict the frequency of radiolabeled mono- and polyiodinated antibodies: First, a gaussian distribution predicted the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33115">iodine atoms</z:chebi> per antibody in labelings A and B, respectively; then, the radiolabeling probability was developed according to the Newton binome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final radiochemical purity was &gt;98.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> labelings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final mean specific activities were 169.7 MBq/mg and 32.8 MBq/mg, corresponding to 0.87 and 0.17 iodine atoms per antibody in labelings A and B, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Labeling B showed a significantly higher immunoreactivity than did labeling A, the mean relative increase in binding being &gt; or =28% for both Raji cells and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictive statistical analysis indicated that 57.3% and 15.4% of radiolabeled antibodies in labelings A and B, respectively, were polyiodinated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low specific activity of 131I-rituximab allowed preservation of a high immunoreactivity and correlated with the prediction of a low percentage of polyiodinated radiolabeled antibodies </plain></SENT>
