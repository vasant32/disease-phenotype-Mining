<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From September 1977 to January 1981, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Group at the CCABC performed 213 aspirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 213, 180 were considered to be diagnostically useful, with 33 being unsatisfactory or no action was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 180 considered useful, 170 were positive, and prompted institution of therapy (84), provided guide to appropriate treatment (84), provided rapid solution to clinical situation (65), provided improved understanding of clinical situation (78), and prevented invasive procedure [minor (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi>), 31; intermediate (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi>), 88; major (laparotomy or thoracotomy), 18] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten negative results delayed therapy (3), led to unnecessary or inappropriate investigation (1), led to incorrect therapy, (4), and were a source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> (10) </plain></SENT>
