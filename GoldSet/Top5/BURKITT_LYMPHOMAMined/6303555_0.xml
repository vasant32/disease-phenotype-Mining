<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>95-8 and P3HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nonproducer EBV genome carrier cell line, Raji, and the EBV negative cell line, Ramos, were not significantly affected </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EHNA alone was noncytotoxic and even had a mild stimulatory effect on cell multiplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase in Raji and Ramos cells was similar to that observed in human cord blood lymphocytes, as determined by <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A low level of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase was detected in P3HR-1 cells and the enzyme was absent from B  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>95-8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in the absence of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase, ara-A cytotoxicity increased </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ara-A, however, inhibited the transformation of human cord blood lymphocytes by EBV, which EHNA did not inhibit </plain></SENT>
