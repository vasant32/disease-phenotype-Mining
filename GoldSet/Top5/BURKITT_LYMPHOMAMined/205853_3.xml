<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cell lines were remarkably similar to each other with respect to the presence of EBV and its expression, the surface properties of the cells and their stability, and the functional products of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic examination of the cell lines revealed the common loss of a single chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slight differences noted in karyotypes suggest some divergence from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stem cell and imply a clonal origin </plain></SENT>
