<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of disease is a result of the failure of the immune system to recognize these abnormal cells and down-regulation of crucial molecules required for cognate CD4(+) T cell recognition has been postulated as a means of immune escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that an embryonic kidney cell line (293 cells) transfected with CD154 (40 L.1) are capable of not only maintaining the viability of primary ALL cells in culture but can also up-regulate the expression of a number of crucial molecules involved in antigen recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that 40 L.1 cell stimulation of primary ALL cell cultures can not only enhance the allogeneic and autologous MLR response to such cells but will also induce CTL effectors which are capable of lysing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> autologous ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is therefore conceivable that such an approach could be used to generate an active anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> response in patients, following conventional therapy, reducing the incidence of recurrence </plain></SENT>
