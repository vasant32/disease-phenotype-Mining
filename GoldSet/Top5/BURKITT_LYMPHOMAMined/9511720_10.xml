<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The scavenger receptor (SR-A) is considered to play a role in host defense by scavenging endotoxins, oxidized proteins, and denatured or otherwise modified self components, which are routed toward degradation in macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that SR-A also functions as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous finding of SR-A expression by high endothelial cells of venules and on follicular dendritic cells in peripheral lymph nodes prompted us to investigate whether SR-A can act as an addressin for lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here that activated B cells adhere to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells transfected with either the type I or type II isoform of SR-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, resting B cells isolated from peripheral blood did not adhere to SR-A transfected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other types of leukocytes did not bind to SR-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adhesive properties of B lymphocytes in different stages of activation were further explored using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines of the B cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro EBV-transformed B cell line IARC171 showed enhanced adhesiveness to SR-A, whereas the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, BL41, Rael, and Bl16 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SR-A-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of B-lymphoblasts occurred both at 37 and 4 degrees C, suggesting that it was not dependent on cell metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The known polyanionic ligands for SR-A, fucoidan, and acetylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, which bind to a positively charged portion of the collagen-like domain of SR-A, did not inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that SR-A mediates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of activated B lymphocytes through a binding site that differs from the one that binds polyanionic ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together, our data suggest that SR-A plays a role in the recruitment of activated B cells into lymph nodes and inflammatory lesions by acting as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule for such cells </plain></SENT>
