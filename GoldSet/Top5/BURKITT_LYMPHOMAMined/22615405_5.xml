<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glutamine is converted to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> by GLS, entering the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27093">tricarboxylic acid</z:chebi> cycle as an important energy source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less well-recognized, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> can also be converted to proline through Î”(1)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23763">pyrroline</z:chebi>-5-carboxylate (P5C) and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that some MYC-induced cellular effects are due to MYC regulation of proline metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proline oxidase, also known as proline dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH), the first enzyme in proline catabolism, is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor that inhibits proliferation and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MiR-23b* is processed from the same transcript as miR-23b; the latter inhibits the translation of GLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using MYC-inducible human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model P493 and PC3 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> cells, we showed that MYC suppressed POX/PRODH expression primarily through up-regulating miR-23b* </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition in the absence of MYC was partially reversed by POX/PRODH knockdown, indicating the importance of suppression of POX/PRODH in MYC-mediated cellular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, MYC not only inhibited POX/PRODH, but also markedly increased the enzymes of proline biosynthesis from glutamine, including P5C synthase and P5C reductase 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MYC-induced proline biosynthesis from glutamine was directly confirmed using (13)C,(15)N-glutamine as a tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The metabolic link between glutamine and proline afforded by MYC emphasizes the complexity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the relationship between glutamine and proline metabolism should provide a deeper understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism while enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
