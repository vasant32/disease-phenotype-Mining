<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adaptation to large-scale production is possible utilizing either Sendai virus or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Newcastle disease</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Priming of cultures before induction is unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interferon produced has properties similar to human leukocyte interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production of lymphoblastoid interferon per cell is increased two- to fourfold after dilution with serum-free medium of a saturation-density culture of Namalva induced with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Newcastle disease</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum interferon yields were obtained 27 h after the addition of virus, using cultures diluted to 4 X 10(5) to 9 X 10(5) cells per ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of glutamine in the dilution medium was required for maximum interferon production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Newcastle disease</z:e> virus appeared to inhibit the rates of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis more effectively in the diluted cultures </plain></SENT>
