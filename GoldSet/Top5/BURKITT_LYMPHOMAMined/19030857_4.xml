<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has not been established whether chemotherapy should be delayed in patients with spontaneous TLS, and several studies have shown poor prognoses in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with prephase chemotherapy using the modified LMB-89 regimen in patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/L) at a high risk of developing TLS from February 1998 to February 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy regimen was followed by the modified LMB-89 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVVH was applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before prephase chemotherapy or within 2 h of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 19.7 months (range 1-97.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three had Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; their median age was 48 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The international prognostic indices were &gt;3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had spontaneous TLS and four patients were at a high risk of TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CVVH was continued for 109 h (range 70.5-157.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had fatal metabolic complications related to TLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Renal function had recovered fully before induction chemotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 1-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were both 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, chemotherapy combined with CVVH might be effective and safe in patients with advanced Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at a high risk of developing TLS </plain></SENT>
