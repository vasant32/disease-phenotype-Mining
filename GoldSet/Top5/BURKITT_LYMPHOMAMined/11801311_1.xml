<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FISH analysis revealed six patients with the fusion gene <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 on chromosome 21, three of whom possessed a double fusion gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the AML1 probe revealed hyperdiploid clones that were not detected in the conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A discrepancy between the proportion of cells with the fusion gene in interphase nuclei and metaphases was noted </plain></SENT>
