<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) 6 (also known as 3c) is a latent nuclear protein with an M(r) of about 160K which is invariably expressed in EBV-immortalized B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It includes a putative basic leucine zipper domain; as such it is a good candidate for a regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 75% of the EBNA 6 coding sequence is deleted from <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes carried in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived cell line, Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus although Raji cells express <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of the remaining five EBNAs and low levels of latent membrane protein (LMP), EBNA 6 protein is completely absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we have established Raji clones stably expressing EBNA 6 after cotransfection of an EBNA 6 gene under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter with a selectable marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these clones has revealed that EBNA 6 induces a significant increase in the expression of LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition the cells have undergone a number of morphological and phenotypic changes consistent with blast-activation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Raji cells expressing EBNA 6 show ruffling of the cell membrane and the development of a polarity defined by multiple villous ('spiky') projections at one end of the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This morphological change is associated with a dramatic increase in the expression of the cytoskeletal protein, vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EBV-associated B cell activation marker CD23 (blast 2) is induced to high levels although other activation markers such as CD30 and CD39 are unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these changes appear to be independent of the precise levels of EBNA 6 protein expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBNA 2 has been shown previously to trans-activate the LMP gene and in the control Raji cells, EBNA 6-positive Raji cells and in B lymphoblastoid cells similar levels of EBNA 2 are expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings are therefore most consistent with a model in which EBNA 6 either augments or complements the action of EBNA 2 in the induction of LMP and the cascade of gene expression which leads to B cell activation and immortalization by EBV </plain></SENT>
