<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients were receiving standard insulins, 19 monocomponent preparations, 24 oral hypoglycaemic agents and seven dietary restriction alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three methods were used to detect complexes: measurement of complement components, a Clq binding assay (BA) and the Raji cell radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complement components were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven (31%) of the group on standard insulins had a positive Raji cell RIA; none had an abnormal Clq-BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient on monocomponent therapy had a mildly positive Raji cell RIA; Clq-BA was negative in each patient of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (54%) of the patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents were positive on one or both assays while one patient on diet alone was abnormal on both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that immune complex production is common in both insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring diabetics and that this phenomenon is strikingly less frequent in patients on monocomponent insulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such observations could bear relevance to the pathogenesis of microvascular complications in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
