<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies examining herpesvirus-herpesvirus (cytomegalovirus (CMV)-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)) interactions are limited, and many of the studies have been clinical observations suggesting such an interaction exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report aims to examine the in vitro susceptibilities of BJAB-B1 and P3HR-1 cells (EBV positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell lines) to a CMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e>; and show that EBV reactivation occurs after CMV superinfects these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The BJAB-B1 and P3HR-1 cells were observed to be susceptible to a CMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> by detecting the major immediate early (MIE) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcript and protein (p52) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BZLF1 transcript was observed in both cell lines superinfected with CMV, indicating EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BZLF1 protein was observed in the BJAB-B1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antigen detection was not performed in the P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from the in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfections</z:e> support the in vivo studies suggesting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> is related to an EBV reactivation and suggests that CMV may be important as a co-factor in EBV pathogenesis in the immunocompromised patient </plain></SENT>
