<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten lines positive for EBV nuclear antigen (EB-pos) were stained weakly or not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> by antihuman immunoglobulin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> conjugates, whereas EBV nuclear antigen negative (EB-neg) cell lines stained brightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EB-pos lines frequently manifested Fc receptors, particularly for 7S antibody, whereas EB-neg lines did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptors for the C3b component of complement and for EBV, which correlated significantly with each other, were expressed to a much lesser extent by EB-neg lines than by EB-pos lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are pertinent to an understanding of the infrequent association of this virus with American undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's types </plain></SENT>
