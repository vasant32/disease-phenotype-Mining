<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Slow hematopoietic recovery is a well-known feature in patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and here we demonstrate that compared with patients with other malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients stands out, with the median time to recovery of &gt; 50 x 10(9) platelets being 101 days for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and 22-37 days for other patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have consequently evaluated the content and fate of myeloid progenitor cells (BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM) in bone marrow preparations from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients in an attempt to uncover factors of importance for their slow hematopoietic recovery after ABMT using three experimental setups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we analyzed progenitors in marrow samples from 36 patients [18 AML, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), and 13 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL)] exposed to multiple doses of severely myelotoxic cytoreductive regimens and observed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients had suppressed numbers of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E (80% that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers) but increased levels of CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the decrease in ALL patients was more pronounced (50% that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers) and demonstrable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL patients exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitor frequencies of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM, whereas their BFU-E counts were found to be increased nearly two-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, we followed the fate of progenitors through the laboratory manipulations of marrow grafts and found no evidence for selective losses in terms of disease (7 AML, 5 NHL, 1 ALL, and 2 testicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumor</z:mpath> patients) and progenitor type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, we retrospectively evaluated the cell yields of grafts from 121 cases [39 AML, 20 ALL, 22 NHL, 9 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), 18 Hodgkin's disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), and 13 testicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumors</z:mpath>] and found those of heavily treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, and germinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> most affected, with a clear negative correlation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients between age on the one hand and mononuclear cell yield and CFU-GM content on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the amount of previous chemotherapy and age of patients appear to be among the determining factors on the number of myeloid progenitor cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and that thresholds for acceptability of grafts should take these variables into account </plain></SENT>
