<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gammaherpesvirus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> usually result in either a productive lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, characterized by expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes and rapid cell lysis, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e>, characterized by limited <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression and no cell lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report characterization of endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68), a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells supported gammaHV68 replication in vitro, but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis, proliferated, and remained viable in culture for an extended time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size, complexity, and cell-surface protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene transcripts, GFP fluorescence from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> surface protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome of this long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was promoted by the gammaHV68 v-cyclin, because in the absence of the v-cyclin, viability was significantly reduced following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts, and this increased viability was dependent on the v-cyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we provide evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of endothelial cells in vivo in immune-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual, persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune-compromised individuals, a context in which gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology frequently occurs </plain></SENT>
