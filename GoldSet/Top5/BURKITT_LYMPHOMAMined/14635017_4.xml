<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel protein encoded by the BFRF1 gene of the Epstein-Barr virus was identified recently [Farina et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2000) J Virol 74:3235-3244], which is antigenic "in vivo" and expressed early in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replicative cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, its subcellular localization was examined in greater detail comparing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induced producing and nonproducing cell lines by immunofluorescence: in 12-0-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>)-induced Raji and B95-8 cells, as well as in anti-IgG-stimulated Akata cells, the protein appeared to be localized over the cell nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar nuclear membrane localization was observed in epithelial cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral hairy leukoplakia</z:e>, a pathological manifestation of permissive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, upon transfection of BFRF1 in the EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DG75, the protein was localized predominantly over the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The membrane localization was abolished when DG75 cells were transfected with a C-terminal deletion mutant of BFRF1 lacking the transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because induced Raji cells do not produce virus, the above observations indicate that the nuclear membrane localization is not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> production, but requires the expression of EBV genes, and suggest that additional proteins, expressed early during <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, might be necessary to target the protein to the nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunogold electron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections of induced B95-8 cells showed that BFRF1 on the nuclear membranes was concentrated over multilayered domains representing areas of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication or at the sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> budding, suggesting that BFRF1 is involved in the process of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> assembly </plain></SENT>
