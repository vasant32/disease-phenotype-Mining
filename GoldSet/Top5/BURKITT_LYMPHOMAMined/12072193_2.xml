<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the CM1 (centrocyte/-blast marker 1) molecule is expressed only in germinal center B cells, specifically, in a subpopulation of centroblasts and centrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by anti-CM1 in the Ramos and Raji human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ramos is protected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by the crosslinking of sIgM and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> by the ligation of CD40 with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this investigation on the effect of CM1 on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, we found that cellular signaling by CM1 induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and decreases cell viability, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines cultured for 24 hours with protein-G <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> beads conjugated anti-CM1 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation by CD40 ligated with sCD40L protected Raji cells from CM1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but did not protect Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after anti-CM1 mAb stimulation, CD95 expression was upregulated and CD40 expression was unaltered or slightly decreased in Ramos cells, whereas CD95 was downregulated and CD40 was slightly upregulated in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The engagement of CD40 by sCD40L enhanced CD95 expression, but the level of CM1 expression was unchanged in Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, sCD40L downregulated both CD95 and CM1 expression in Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the caspase-8 specific inhibitor blocked CM1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, but not in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane permeabilization was observed only in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effector caspase inhibitor, z-DEVD, blocked CM1-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found that CM1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is achieved via different initiation pathways, which are cell-type dependent </plain></SENT>
