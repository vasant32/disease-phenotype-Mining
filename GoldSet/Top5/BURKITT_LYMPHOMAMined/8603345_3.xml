<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can readily be propagated by intravenous transfer of mainly bone marrow or spleen cells into syngeneic recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that these mouse malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathies</z:e> (MMG) show clinical and biologic features that closely resemble those of the corresponding human diseases and thus could be used as experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on cytogenetic analysis of two mouse MW and five MM in vivo cell lines of the 5TMM series propagated in syngeneic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated clonal abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines, hyperdiploid karyotype in both MW and one MM lines, and hypotriploidy, hypertriploidy, or hypotetraploidy in the other lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities of chromosome 15 were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MM lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five MM lines, frequent rearrangements were also found for chromosome numbers 1, 2, 5, and 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single chromosomal abnormality, as found in induced mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and resembling Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, was not found in mouse MM and MW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that spontaneously originating C57BL MM of the 5T series is a better model for human MM than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53181">pristane</z:chebi>-induced BALB/c or NZB <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
