<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein analysis using a mutant-specific antibody and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic DNA revealed changes relative to the standard p53 protein sequence in 12 of the 16 lines studied, including 10 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation of p53 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines was usually accompanied by loss of the other allele of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing of the mutated p53 cDNAs for gain of transforming activity or loss of growth suppression activity showed that several of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> mutants were functionally altered from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
