<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far there have only been a limited number of other chemicals evaluated for their ability to produce cross-links </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the work described here was to evaluate whether select industrial chemicals can form DNA-protein cross-links in human cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>, 2-furaldehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17153">propionaldehyde</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27871">chloroacetaldehyde</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">sodium arsenite</z:chebi>, and a deodorant tablet [Mega Blue; hazardous component listed as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">tris</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24712">hydroxymethyl</z:chebi>)nitromethane] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term cytotoxicity was evaluated and used to select appropriate doses for in vitro testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA-protein cross-linking was evaluated at no fewer than three doses and two cell lysate washing temperatures (45 and 65 degrees C) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two washing temperatures were used to assess the heat stability of the DNA-protein cross-link, 2-Furaldehyde, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17153">propionaldehyde</z:chebi> produced statistically significant increases in DNA-protein cross-links at washing temperatures of 45 degrees C, but not 65 degrees C, and at or above concentrations of 5, 17.5, and 75 mM, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29678">Sodium arsenite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27871">chloroacetaldehyde</z:chebi> did not produce significantly increased DNA-protein cross-links at either temperature nor at any dose tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excluding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> and 2-furaldehyde treatments, significant increases in DNA-protein cross-links were observed only at doses that resulted in complete cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 4 d following dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates that DNA-protein cross-links can be formed in vitro following exposure to a variety of industrial compounds and that most cross-links are formed at cytotoxic concentrations </plain></SENT>
