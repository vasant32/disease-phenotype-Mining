<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic DNA polymerase activity of the in vitro translated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> required the presence of the 47-kDa BMRF1 (EA-D) gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antiserum raised to the BALF5 gene product expressed in Escherichia coli specifically precipitated a 116-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> in extracts of latently infected lymphoblastoid cells induced for EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of the EBVpol and EA-D(BMRF1) to discrete foci within the nuclei of induced cells; however, the blockade of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA synthesis resulted in diffuse nuclear staining patterns for both antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine staining of these discrete foci colocalizing with EBVpol suggests that they are sites of early <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that EA-D(BMRF1) may be an accessory protein of the EBV DNA polymerase which colocalizes in vivo with EBVpol to sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication and cooperates in vitro to form an active EBVpol holoenzyme </plain></SENT>
