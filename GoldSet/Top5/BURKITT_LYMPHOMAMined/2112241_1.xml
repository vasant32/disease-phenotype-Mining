<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B cell extract has been compared with a HeLa cell extract in an effort to study lymphocyte-specific regulatory factors of kappa light chain gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both extracts were capable of transcribing Vk genes and other <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II dependent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37415">Alpha-amanitin</z:chebi> at [0.1 micrograms/ml] completely inhibited the accumulation of transcripts in both systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At low DNA template concentrations the kappa intronic enhancer stimulated Vk promoter transcription 3-7 fold in B cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enhancer-dependent transcription was abolished by excising the enhancer from the test plasmid with Eco R1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both Vk promoter and enhancer-dependent transcription in HeLa extracts was undetectable at low [DNA] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that kappa enhancer stimulation of Vk transcription in vitro is observed in B cell extracts only under conditions of low DNA template concentration </plain></SENT>
