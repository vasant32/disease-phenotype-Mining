<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV was reactivated in the BLCLs Akata and Raji, and in a LCL OB-R33 cells after cross-linking surface immunoglobulin (sIg) with anti-Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After stimulation with anti-Ig, MAPK phosphorylation was strongly induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BLCLs and in a few LCLs, but not in other LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAPK was constitutively phosphorylated in most LCLs but not in BLCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBNA2 and LMP1, and LMP2A was analyzed with both immunoblotting and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 and LMP1 were expressed in most LCLs and in some BLCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LMP2A was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BLCLs and LCLs except Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that LMPI induces constitutive MAPK phosphorylation, the LMP1 expression vector was transfected into Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAPK phosphorylation was not induced in such transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that BLCLs and LCLs respectively have distinct MAPK phosphorylation patterns, and that induction of MAPK phosphorylation correlates with EBV reactivation in a few cell lines but not in most of the tested cell lines </plain></SENT>
