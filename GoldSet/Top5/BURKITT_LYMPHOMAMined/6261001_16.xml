<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 40 polypeptides were immunoprecipitable by early antigen+/<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen+ antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> could be divided into six classes, immediate-early, early, intermediate, late, very late, and persistent, depending upon the time of synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 40 polypeptides appeared to preexist before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> and persisted despite general cessation of host protein synthesis; none of the persistent proteins was immunoprecipitated by the Epstein-Barr virus antibody-containing serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication was blocked by a variety of inhibitors of DNA synthesis, a number of different patterns of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> synthesis could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of six <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> was blocked by the most virus-specific inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi>, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, seven <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> showed oversynthesis </plain></SENT>
