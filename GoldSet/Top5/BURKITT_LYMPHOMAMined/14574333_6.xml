<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(12;21) translocation resulting in the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 gene fusion is found in 25% of childhood B-cell precursor (BCP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 has been reported to induce cell cycle retardation and thus may influence somatic recombination, we analyzed 214 TEL-AML1-positive ALL by PCR for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a control group, 174 childhood BCP ALL without a <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> had a higher number of Ig/TCR rearrangements than control ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also had a more mature immunogenotype characterized by their high frequency of complete IGH, IGK-Kde, and TCRG rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While IGK-Kde and TCRG were more frequently rearranged on both alleles at higher age, IGH and TCRD rearrangements decreased in their incidence along with a decrease in biallelic IGH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the recombination process continues in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> leading to ongoing rearrangements and possibly also deletions of antigen receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We here provide first evidence that somatic recombination of antigen receptor genes is affected by the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 fusion, and that further age-related differences are probably caused by the longer latency period of the prenatally initiated <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in older children </plain></SENT>
