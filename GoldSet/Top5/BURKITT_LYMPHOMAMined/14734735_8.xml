<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms that determine the response to BCR-mediated EBV activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparison of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Akata, Mutu-I, and Daudi cells, which are representative responders and nonresponders to BCR-mediated EBV activation, respectively, indicated that three signaling pathways, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), were activated in anti-Ig-treated Akata and Mutu-I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in anti-Ig-treated Daudi cells PI3K was not activated, ERK was faintly activated, and p38 MAPK was constitutively phosphorylated irrespective of anti-Ig treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restoration of PI3K activity with insulin-like growth factor 1 restored ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, and was accompanied by EBV activation in anti-Ig-treated Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a specific inhibitor for PI3K, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, inhibited EBV activation by anti-Ig Abs in Akata and Mutu-I cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection assays in EBV-negative Daudi cells revealed that PI3K activated a promoter for BZLF1, which is a switch of EBV activation from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e>, in the absence of other EBV products suggesting that the BZLF promoter was a target of BCR signaling, and that PI3K was important for BCR-mediated BZLF1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the absence of PI3K impedes the progression of signals through the BCR and becomes a determinant of unresponsiveness to BCR-mediated EBV activation </plain></SENT>
