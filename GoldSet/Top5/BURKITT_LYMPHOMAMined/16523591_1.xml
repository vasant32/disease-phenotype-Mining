<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, much less is known about the biological consequences of B-cell signaling through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha and its cognate receptors TNF-R1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line as a model system to study the direct effects of these cytokines on B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Ramos cells with either TNF-alpha or CD40L, but not with interleukin (IL)- 4, interferon (IFN)-gamma and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, resulted in enhanced cell aggregation and enhancement of adherence to glass cover-slips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scanning electron microscopy showed that Ramos cells have a polarized cell surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and exhibit at least 3 cell surface morphological domains: microvilli, filopodia and ruffled membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells adhered to the glass matrix through multiple filopodia/podopodia-like cell processes and demonstrated distinct ruffled-like membrane projections on their opposite pole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction by TNF-alpha or CD40L, but not with IL-4, IFN-gamma and TGF-beta, resulted in increased number and complexity of both types of membrane projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha and CD40L upregulated the expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and the Fas receptor on Ramos cells, without affecting the expression levels of membrane immunoglobulin M or its secretion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry demonstrated that Ramos cells expressed TNF-R1 but very little if any TNF-R2, indicating that TNF-alpha exerted its effects on Ramos cells through the former receptor </plain></SENT>
