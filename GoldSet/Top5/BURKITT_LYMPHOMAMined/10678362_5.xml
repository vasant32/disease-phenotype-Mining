<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> deaminase (CD) enzyme, which converts the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-fluorocytosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi>) into the toxic compound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> efficiently kills EBV-positive cells in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi>, with a substantial bystander killing effect in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the optimal enzyme/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> combination for treating EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we have compared the effectiveness of the CD/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi> combination with the nitroreductase (NTR)/CB1954 combination for killing EBV-positive B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NTR metabolizes CB1954 into an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> that cross-links DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the CD gene or the NTR gene were transfected into two different EBV-positive B-cell lines in vitro, approximately 90% of cells were killed in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi>-dependent manner, although the transfection efficiency was &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, severe combined immunodeficient mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> containing either 30% or 100% of NTR-expressing Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Jijoye) cells were growth inhibited, but not cured, by treatment with intraperitoneal CB1954 (20 mg/kg/day) for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the NTR/CB1954 combination induces efficient bystander killing of EBV-positive B-cell lines in vitro but may not be as effective as the CD/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi> combination for treating B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
