<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now describe the establishment and characterization of a novel human leukemic cell line that recapitulates the pre-B to B cell stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cell line, designated BLIN-1, was initially established in tissue culture medium containing low m.w </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B cell growth factor, and consistently shows a dependency on this cytokine for optimal growth at low density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BLIN-1 cells have a 9p chromosomal abnormality, identical to the abnormality present in the leukemic blasts from the patient's original bone marrow aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunologic phenotype of BLIN-1 is consistent with a cell arrested at the pre-B cell stage of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of Ig gene rearrangement and Ig expression in a series of BLIN-1 subclones show that the cells spontaneously rearrange kappa light chain genes, leading to the differentiation of surface kappa-negative pre-B cells into surface kappa-positive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BLIN-1 cell line is, to our knowledge, the first defined human model for examining this critical developmental stage in human B cell ontogeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, it offers a unique resource for examining variables influencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of kappa L chain gene rearrangement and expression </plain></SENT>
