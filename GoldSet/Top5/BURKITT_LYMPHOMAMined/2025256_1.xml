<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present herein the first evidence that human C3 and, with a higher efficiency, trypsin-cleaved C3 enhanced in vitro phosphorylation of a cellular component, characterized by an apparent molecular weight of 105 kDa, pp105, present in the human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This regulatory activity was associated with C3d fragment generated in trypsin-cleaved C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 16 amino-acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, carrying the LYNVEA sequence of C3d reacting with the C3d receptor (CR2), was synthetized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P16 enhanced, in a dose-dependent curve between 0.3 to 10 microM, in vitro phosphorylation of pp105, as well as C3d fragments present in trypsin-cleaved C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fibrinogen-related synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of 15 amino acids, used as control, had no effect on pp105 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P16 and trypsin-cleaved C3 regulate pp105 phosphorylation through identical pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, p16 represents the 16 amino-acid sequence of C3 which regulated in vitro phosphorylation of pp105 </plain></SENT>
