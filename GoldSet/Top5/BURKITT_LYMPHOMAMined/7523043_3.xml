<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pair of crossed cylindrical <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> lenses allowed multilaser excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> (HeCd) lasers, emitting 16 mW at 442 nm and 35 mW at 325 nm, were used to excite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34638">chromomycin A3</z:chebi> and Hoechst 33258 fluorescence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bivariate flow karyotypes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human male chromosomes and from the Daudi cell line were obtained and were compared to those from a standard instrument using dual water-cooled lasers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new experimental instrument exhibited comparable resolution to that from the standard instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In further experiments with Daudi chromosomes, the 35 mW HeCd laser was replaced with a 10 mW HeCd laser, and the system still gave good, though slightly decreased, resolution </plain></SENT>
