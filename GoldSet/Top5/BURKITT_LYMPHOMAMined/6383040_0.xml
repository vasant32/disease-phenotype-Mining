<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent improvement in the methods of chromosome analysis has allowed recognition of consistent chromosome alterations in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the same time, newly discovered human cellular oncogenes have been mapped to individual chromosomes, with precise band assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of the assignments are coincident with the breakpoints of translocations observed in particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, a relocation of the corresponding oncogenes has been observed in the cells of some of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two notable examples are that of the t(9;22) translocation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), causing the transfer of the oncogene c-abl from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, and that of the t(8;14) translocation of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, causing the transfer of the oncogene c-myc from chromosome 8 to chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings can be taken as indicative of a critical role of chromosome alterations in the origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, through the activation of one or more cellular oncogenes, although there is no firm evidence that such an activation actually occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, some concern exists over the validity of accepting in vitro transformation of a cell line by oncogenes as a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For these reasons the question on the significance of chromosome alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> should not be considered entirely settled yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Useful models, whose study may lead to the clarification of this important point, are represented by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant conditions</z:e>, such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, where chromosome abnormalities are present before the development of a bona fide <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, and by the <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> syndromes, in which there exists an association between a constitutional chromosome anomaly and an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
