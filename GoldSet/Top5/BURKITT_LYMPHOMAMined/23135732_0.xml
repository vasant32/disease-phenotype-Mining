<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of RIP2 mediates divergent signaling pathways including NF-κB activation and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the biological activity of RIP2 in vitro, a large amount of purified protein is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the full length of RIP2 was cloned from human Ramos (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and inserted in a prokaryotic expression vector pET22b, and then the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of RIP2 was induced with IPTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE analysis showed that recombinant human RIP2 (rhRIP2) was mainly expressed as soluble fraction in the supernatant of the cell lysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recombinant protein was subsequently purified by His Trap FF crude to a purity of 90 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay of the purified rhRIP2 showed its functional diversity in different cell lines, a specific inhibitory effect on MCF7 cells, but a promotion on the proliferation of Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified that rhRIP2 could suppress activation of canonical NF-κB in MCF7 cells and activate non-canonical NF-κB signaling in Ramos cells, these data suggested that RIP2 participates in different signaling pathways contributing to its specific effects in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results provided new clues to further explore the regulation mechanisms of RIP2 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
