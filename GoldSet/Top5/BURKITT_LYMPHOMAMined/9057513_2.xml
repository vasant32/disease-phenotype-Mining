<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the CT features of small-bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, compare those features with the radiographic presentation in immunocompetent patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, and discuss the role of CT in the initial detection and evaluation of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal CT examinations of 42 consecutive patients with proven small-bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients, small-bowel examinations were also available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 42-patient study group was divided into two subgroups: 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and 20 immunocompetent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary small-bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was present in 37% of patients and was equally distributed between the two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic types included non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 33 patients, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in seven patients, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Solid organ involvement (liver, splee, kidney, or adrenal glands) was detected in 22% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and in 10% of the immunocompetent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We saw two main patterns of CT appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first pattern, single or multiple segments had circumferential wall thickening, homogeneous in attenuation, that ranged from 1.5 cm to 7 cm (mean, 2.6 cm) in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second pattern, single or multiple cavitary lesions were revealed as nodular and grossly enlarged intestinal lumen with bowel wall thickening in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A polypoid mass that was entirely intraluminal was seen in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> areas of low attenuation were revealed in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intestinal tumors</z:e> of HIV-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mesenteric or retroperitoneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was seen in 45% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and 60% of the immunocompetent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The gross morphologic features, distribution. pattern of CT presentation, degree of wall thickening, and length of involvement were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> similar in the two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than half (52%) of the individuals with small-bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed at our institution in the last 4 years were patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The features revealed by CT scans were characteristic or highly suggestive of small-bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We saw no significant differences in the radiographic features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and immunocompetent patients </plain></SENT>
