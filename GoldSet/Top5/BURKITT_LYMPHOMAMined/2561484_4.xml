<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of these cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 did not lead to the synthesis of detectable amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> was observed in several monoclonal B- and T-cell lines after incubation with LTA4, but not after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji was found to possess higher LTA4-hydrolase activity than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the LTA4-hydrolase gene but not the 5-lipoxygenase gene was demonstrated on the transcriptional level in Northern blots and on the translational level by Western blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of human monocytes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 resulted in the release of LTA4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coincubations of transformed lymphocytes and monocytes stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 produced increased amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> as compared with monocytes alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> influence on lymphocyte activation was studied and CD23 expression was used as a marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of this antigen was enhanced on resting B lymphocytes in synergy with B-cell growth-promoting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> also augmented DNA synthesis, cell replication and IgG secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that extracellular LTA4, released from activated monocytes, is converted by lymphocytes into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">LTB4</z:chebi> which might cause activation and differentiation of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
