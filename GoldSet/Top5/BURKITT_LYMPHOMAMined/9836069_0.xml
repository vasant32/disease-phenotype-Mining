<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using consensus primers for the IgH gene was used for remission and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) analysis in the follow-up of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) of B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used to distinguish the specific clonal amplicons from the background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Authors found that, in a series of 22 patients followed-up for 5.3 to 11.1 years, the PCR-SSCP technique could detect at least one rearrangement at initial diagnosis in 21 (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who remained in continuous complete remission were PCR-SSCP negative at remission controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 22 patients had one or more bone marrow relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PCR-SSCP method demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in three of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 of the 7 (86%) of patients with disease recurrence from whom samples were taken within 6 months before a clinically overt relapse, PCR-SSCP became positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Authors conclude that PCR-SSCP of a rearrangement marker might have a role as a convenient technique for monitoring emerging relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may also detect unrelated clones or ongoing secondary recombination events during progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, PCR-SSCP is not sensitive enough to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom disease will later recur </plain></SENT>
