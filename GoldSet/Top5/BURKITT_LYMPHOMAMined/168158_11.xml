<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inoculation of concentrated virus derived from the P3HR-1 line of Burkitt origin did not lead to lymphoproliferations in five marmosets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of these received non-neutralized, and two received neutralized P3HR-1 virus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It contained EBV-specific DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, EBV-synthesizing lymphoblastoid lines were established from a tumorous lymph-node, as well as from the spleen of the diseased marmoset </plain></SENT>
