<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Here, we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a new 11-parameter flow cytometry (FCM) approach versus conventional cytology (CC) for detecting neoplastic cells in stabilized CSF samples from newly diagnosed aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) at high risk of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse, using a prospective, multicentric study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Moreover, we compared the distribution of different subpopulations of CSF leukocytes and the clinico-biologic characteristics of CSF+ versus CSF-, patients, in an attempt to define new algorithms useful for predicting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 27 (22%) of 123 patients showed infiltration by FCM, while CC was positive in only seven patients (6%), with three other cases being suspicious (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CC+/FCM+ samples typically had more than 20% neoplastic B cells and/or &gt;or= one neoplastic B cell/microL, while FCM+/CC- samples showed lower levels (P &lt; .0001) of infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, presence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease by FCM could be predicted with a high specificity when increased serum beta2-microglobulin and neurological symptoms coexisted, while peripheral blood involvement was the only independent parameter associated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with low predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FCM significantly improves the sensitivity of CC for the identification of leptomeningeal disease in aggressive B-NHL at higher risk of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease, particularly in paucicellular samples </plain></SENT>
