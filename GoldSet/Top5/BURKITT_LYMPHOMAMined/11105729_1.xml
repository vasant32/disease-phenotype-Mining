<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha, PA, and RBP were measured in 52 patients (0.8 to 17 years old): 18 African Americans, 34 whites; 27 newly diagnosed (ND), and 25 in clinical remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of TNF-alpha were higher in patients than in 46 healthy children (p &lt; 0.05), but were not different between ND and CR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase proteins (APP) were different among groups: ND &gt; CR &gt; controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of PA and RBP were lower in patients than in controls (p &lt; 0.051, and tended to be higher in CR than in ND patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>African-American patients had lower concentrations of TNF-alpha, PA, and RBP but higher APP than white patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CR patients and African-American patients who died tended to have higher levels of TNF-alpha and APP, but lower PA and RBP than those who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher percentage of ND African Americans (45%) than of ND whites (13%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that undernutrition and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in CR patients and African Americans were associated with poor survival, and that ND African Americans have a poorer outcome than whites independently of TNF-alpha levels </plain></SENT>
