<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with chromosome 1q21 abnormalities, FcRH5 expression is deregulated, implicating FcRH5 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus infects and immortalizes B cells, and is implicated in the etiology of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of genes located on 1q21-25 has been proposed as a surrogate for Epstein-Barr virus in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now report that Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) markedly induces the expression of the FcRH5 gene, encoded on chromosome 1q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction occurred in the absence of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins and did not require de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 lacks a DNA-binding domain and can target responsive genes through the host DNA binding protein CBF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that induction of FcRH5 by EBNA2 is strictly CBF1 dependent, as it was abolished in CBF1-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, EBNA2 targeted CBF1 binding sites present in the FcRH5 promoter in vivo, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results identify FcRH5 as a novel, direct target of EBNA2 that may contribute to the development of Epstein-Barr virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
