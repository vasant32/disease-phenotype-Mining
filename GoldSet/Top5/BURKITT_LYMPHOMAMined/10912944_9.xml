<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients had blood and bone marrow manifestations characterized by the presence of morphologically immature or blastic B-lineage lymphoid cells expressing CD5 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 70 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence or degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was variable among this group at staging evaluation, although two patients did not have these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had an antecedent diagnosis of classical nodal mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, without prior morphologic blood or bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other patients lacked a history of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median white blood cell count was 120 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, whereas only one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leukemic peripheral blood cells in these six cases were small to medium in size with fine or granular nuclear chromatin and small or inconspicuous nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of marrow involvement was interstitial or diffuse, with cells showing immature nuclear features resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or blastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> demonstrated a consistent immunophenotype of B-cell lineage, surface immunoglobulin positivity, and CD5 antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The progenitor cell-associated markers CD34 and TdT were not expressed, and CD23 antigen was either negative (three of four cases) or only weakly present (one of four cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of a karyotypic t(11;14)(q13;q32) was documented in one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, whereas two other cases had BCL-1 gene rearrangements by either polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression was noted in three of four cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This patient group was characterized by very poor overall survival (median, 3 months; range, 0.5 to 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The aggregate clinical, pathologic, and genetic data in these unusual cases are consistent with de novo or predominant leukemic presentations of blastic mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis in such cases is greatly facilitated by cytogenetic studies or the demonstration of BCL-1/cyclin D1 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
