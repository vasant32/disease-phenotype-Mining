<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin A for 72 hr have a 10-fold greater capacity to repair DNA damage induced by N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluorene than do unstimulated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased capacity of concanavalin A-activated cells to repair DNA is not observed after 24 hr in culture, a time at which stimulated cells have not begun to synthesize DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum rate of repair synthesis obtained after treatment of stimulated cells with the "large patch"-inducing agent, N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluorene, is twice that obtained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25255">methyl methanesulfonate</z:chebi>, an agent inducing "small patch" repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference between the maximum rates obtained with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluorene and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25255">methyl methanesulfonate</z:chebi> is 6-fold in a human lymphoblastoid line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated lymphocytes show almost identical rates of repair after treatment with either N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluorene or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25255">methyl methanesulfonate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is close correlation between the rate of N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluorene-induced repair synthesis and the loss of acetylaminofluorene adducts from DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of lymphocytes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25255">methyl methanesulfonate</z:chebi> leads to degradation of cellular DNA with the production of single-stranded regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such degradation is not observed with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-2-acetylaminofluroene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the rate of excision repair is a function of the capacity of cells for DNA synthesis and that lymphocytes that do not synthesize DNA have a limited repair capacity and cannot be used to distinguish between large and small patch repair </plain></SENT>
