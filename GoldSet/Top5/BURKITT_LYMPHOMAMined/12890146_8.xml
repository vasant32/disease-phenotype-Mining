<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The TP53 gene encodes a nuclear protein implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TP53 mutations and other alterations have been described in numerous types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and some of these have been associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize TP53 mutations in childhood B non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, their correlation with clinical prognostic factors and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 49 children with B non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were examined for TP53 alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of exons 5-9, direct sequencing and by p53 immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations of TP53 were detected in 11 of 49 (22.5%) patients and more specifically in 20% of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence analysis showed missense mutations in 10 cases and an insertion mutation in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the transition type occurred more frequently than transversions (seven of 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the spectrum of single-nucleotide substitutions showed a 30% frequency of transition mutations in CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of p53 immunostaining positivity was 36% (15 of 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a very good agreement between protein expression and the presence of TP53 mutation (P=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found regarding age, gender, clinical stage and LDH level and TP53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison of EFS curves using the log-rank test were also not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the analysis of the effects of mutations on the core p53 structure identified biological and biochemical mutants with phenotypes probably related to different response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that some types of mutants can alter the protein distinctly and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, the impact of TP53 mutations on response to therapy may also be influenced by disruption of other genes </plain></SENT>
