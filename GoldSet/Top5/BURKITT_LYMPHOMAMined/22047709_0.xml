<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 29 children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 61 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis revealed that XRCC1194Trp allele showed a protective effect against longer FN and mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also statistically increased risk for severe mucositis in patients with XRCC1Arg399Gln polymorphism </plain></SENT>
