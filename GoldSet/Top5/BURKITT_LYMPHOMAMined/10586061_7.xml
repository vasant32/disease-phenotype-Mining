<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In certain types of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the c-myc gene has undergone translocation to the S regions associated with heavy chain switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has not been established whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> induces recombination activities, which in turn promote translocation of c-myc, or whether translocation precedes <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and provides a growth advantage that is further enhanced by factors encoded or induced by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To distinguish between these possibilities, we have compared the level of switch recombination activities in the EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, BJAB, and in its EBV-infected derivative, BJAB-B1, in experiments that assayed recombination of an extrachromosomal switch substrate during transient transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that BJAB-B1 and other EBV-positive B cell lines supported high levels of recombination of switch substrates, to produce junctions like those found in products of chromosomal switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, BJAB did not support comparable levels of switch substrate recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In EBV-positive B cell lines, the ability to support switch substrate recombination correlated with levels of LR1, a B cell-specific factor which is a transcriptional regulator of c-myc and which also appears to function in switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations support the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> can induce activities that affect switch recombination and thus contribute to the translocations of c-myc to the S regions that characterize certain classes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
