<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-TS was first allowed to react exhaustively with human blood cells followed by HeLa cells and human diploid fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The residual reactivity was studied by stepwise absorption with an EBV-negative B lymphoblastoid cell line, BJAB, and then with B1--19, a clone derived from EBV transformed BJAB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These processes delineated three kinds of reactivities in anti-TS having specificities for antigens on B blasts, EBV-determined cell surface antigen(s) and antigens that are exclusive to Raji cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are compatible with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> protein content of TS and with the results of our earlier in vitro cell-mediated immunity studies using a similar preparation of Raji cell TS </plain></SENT>
