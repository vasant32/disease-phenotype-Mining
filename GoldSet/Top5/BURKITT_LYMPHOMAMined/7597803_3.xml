<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanism regulating the EBV replication cycle, several sublines were obtained from HR-1 cells by the limiting dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on their biochemical and molecular characteristics, these sublines can be categorized into two classes: the high EBV-DNA containing (H) subline and low EBV-DNA containing (L) subline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of EBV proteins, such as EBV polymerases, EBV DNase, EAD, ZEBRA, MA, and VCA, was much higher in H sublines than in L sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 20% of cells in the H subline express those proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to regular EBV DNA restriction enzyme fragments, additional DNA restriction enzyme fragments, as detected by different EBV DNA fragment probes, were found to be present in H sublines but not in L sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No BamH1 W-Z DNA fragment rearrangement, which was the primary reason for ZEBRA expression in a high EBV-DNA containing subline, Clone 5, was found in H sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When L sublines were treated with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, EBV-specific proteins, including ZEBRA protein, could be induced in cells, but no virus could be detected in the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the lack of EBV production by L sublines is more than the simple lack of expression of ZEBRA protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>L sublines are susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and are capable of producing EBV after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance of the presence of L cells in the H subline for the propagation of EBV in culture is suggested </plain></SENT>
