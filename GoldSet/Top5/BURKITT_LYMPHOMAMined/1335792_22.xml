<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations indicate that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> consists of several subtypes, defined by their clinical and molecular features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each geographical region so far studied appears to consist of a different mixture of subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there appear to be geographic 'gradients' with respect to the fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> associated with EBV and the type of 8;14 chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of EBV association is highest in Equatorial Africa, lowest in North America and intermediate in South America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with breakpoints far upstream of the c-myc gene follows a similar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that the subtypes of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are environmentally determined, and we propose that the pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>) to which the young child is exposed influences the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subtype distribution by altering the relative and absolute numbers of various B cell precursors at sites of B cell ontogeny (the bone marrow, and possibly mesentery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These B cell precursors are the cells which are susceptible to the specific chromosomal translocations associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further propose that immunoglobulin enhancers (recognized and unrecognized) both influence the likelihood of the translocation occurring, and in at least a fraction of cases, contribute to the deregulation of a c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV, via EBNA-1, the only invariably expressed latent-gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, probably influences c-myc expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by increasing immunoglobulin enhancer function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in effect, EBV collaborates with the translocations associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in causing c-myc deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This collaboration is independent of the breakpoint location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While other molecular abnormalities must be able to contribute to myc deregulation in the same way, EBV association in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is probably determined by the age at which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> occurs (being more likely when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurs in very young children) and perhaps also by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497442" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other infectious diseases</z:e> that numerically influence the fraction, and predominant stage of differentiation (and hence translocation breakpoint sites) of immature B cells infected by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of EBV in many such cells greatly increases the incidence rate of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, since one of the genetic lesions needed to deregulate c-myc is already present </plain></SENT>
