<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PuF site on the silent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc allele was unoccupied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody, UV cross-linking followed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-gel electrophoresis, and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Access to this site is blocked in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> silent c-myc allele; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
