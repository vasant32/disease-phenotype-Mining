<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is synthesized at elevated levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells but has also been detected at low concentrations in several types of nontransformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p53 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells is immunogenic and elicits specific antibody production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigenic determinants of the p53 protein were studied by specific binding to anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies obtained from the RA3-2C2, PAb122, and PAb421 established hybridoma cell lines, and their conservation was followed in various animal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that whereas mouse p53 efficiently immunoprecipitated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies, human and rat p53 bound PAb122 and PAb421 but lacked a determinant binding RA3-2C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hamster p53 molecule represented a third category, which immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-p53 antibodies but failed to bind <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three monoclonal antibodies analyzed here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using these monoclonal antibodies, we detected no variations between p53 found in transformed and p53 found in nontransformed cells, within a given species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results also showed that RA3-2C2, which recognizes a mouse-specific determinant, binds a site located at a proteolytic digestion fragment of the p53 molecule that differs from that containing PAb122 and PAb421 recognition site(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p53 is a single protein that can be immunoprecipitated through different antigenic determinants that vary between species </plain></SENT>
