<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A simple method for obtaining high-resolution banding patterns on elongated chromosomes was devised as follows: Human lymphocytes cultured for 3 days with phytohemagglutinin were exposed to EB (5-10 micrograms/ml) and Colcemid (0.02 micrograms/ml) simultaneously for 2 h and then routinely harvested for chromosome preparation </plain></SENT>
