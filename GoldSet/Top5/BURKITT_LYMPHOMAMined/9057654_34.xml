<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of gelatinase A, gelatinase B, interstitial collagenase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in reactive lymphoid cells, as well as in a series of cell lines derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of B- and T-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using both Northern blot analysis and zymography, gelatinase B activity was detected by zymography in two Burkitt cell lines and in a tonsillar cell suspension, while gelatinase A and interstitial collagenase activities were not detected by either method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TIMP-1 expression was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in the multipotential neoplastic K-562 cell line, the high grade Burkitt's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, isolated tonsillar B cells and at low levels in peripheral blood T cells, but was not expressed in any of the neoplastic T-cell lines or isolated peripheral blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TIMP-2 expression was restricted to tissues containing cells of T-cell lineage with high levels being observed in the neoplastic T-cell lines and lower levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood T cells and hyperplastic tonsil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was confirmed at the protein level by reverse zymography and immunofluorescence assays using antihuman TIMP polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of gelatinase B by the high grade B-cell Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines is consistent with previous findings in large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and indicates that this enzyme may play an important role in high grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TIMP expression correlated with cell lineage in that TIMP-1 was primarily observed in B cells and TIMP-2 was restricted to T cells </plain></SENT>
