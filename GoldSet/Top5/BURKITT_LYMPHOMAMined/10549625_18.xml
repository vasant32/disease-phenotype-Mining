<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these receptors, mouse Ly49A, is expressed by 20% of NK cells and inhibits the killing of H-2D(d) but not D(b)-expressing target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the trans-acting factor TCF-1 binds to two sites in the Ly49A promoter and regulates its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that TCF-1 determines the size of the Ly49A NK cell subset in vivo in a dosage-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that clonal Ly49A acquisition during NK cell development is regulated by TCF-1 </plain></SENT>
