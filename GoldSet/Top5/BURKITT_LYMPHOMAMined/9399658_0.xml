<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the timing of p53 mutations detected in the malignant cells of a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (BRG-P) with respect to other maturation or transforming events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BRG-P cell line, derived from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patient, was of special value since it displayed subclones that had undergone an isotype switch from IgM to IgA1 (BRG-M and BRG-A cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BRG-M and BRG-A cells were characterized by the same monoclonal c-myc and VDJ rearrangements and by the expression of Ig receptors with specificity for a 45 kDa protein of human breast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of p53 mutations in the different BRG subclones showed that 1) BRG-M cells displayed 2 different p53 mutations in trans; since the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells also showed the same mutations, this finding indicated that both occurred in vivo; 2) one of the p53 alleles of BRG-A cells was lost, while the other showed a mutation different from those seen in BRG-M cells; and 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 mutations observed in BRG-M or BRG-A cells resulted in the functional inactivation of the transcriptional activation function of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together, our data demonstrate that p53 mutations were relatively late events during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in view of the role of p53 in cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, it is conceivable that BRG cells were subjected to a strong selective pressure that favored p53 inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such inactivation was possibly required to counterbalance other potentially apoptotic events, including the presence of a deregulated c-myc oncogene and signals delivered by the host environment in situ </plain></SENT>
