<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The successful clinical experience with antibody LL2 (an IgG2a, anti-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> antibody) in radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy suggests that this antibody may have potential as a carrier of cytotoxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The internalization, cellular trafficking, and catabolism of this antibody in target human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Internalization of intact antibody as well as of the F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments was detected by an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled anti-mouse second antibody probe, and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Internalization of intact IgG (or the fragments) was observed as early as 5 min after incubation at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the internalized antibodies were present as micro-particles inside the cell membrane, and were translocated to the lysosomal compartment within 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomic location of the internalized antibody, before translocation to the lysosomal compartment, was deduced by comparing the fluorescence images obtained with the antibody to those obtained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39442">fluorescent probes</z:chebi> with known cellular distribution in a co-internalization study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Golgi-like compartment was found to be involved in the translocation of the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular catabolism of the bound antibody was studied by using 125I-labeled antibody on the target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 21 h, 40% of the radioactivity was released into the supernatant as degraded fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observation suggested that the antibody was degraded mainly in the lysosomes, since the degradation was significantly inhibited in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> or leupeptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subcellular fractionation of Raji cells after the binding of 125I-labeled LL2 indicated that the antibody was translocated to lysosomes as evidenced by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of internalization (Ke) of LL2, and the re-expression of the antigen were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rapid internalization of LL2 and the re-expression of the antigen suggest that this antibody may have potential as a therapeutic immunoconjugate, since it could deliver a higher accumulation of cytotoxic agents into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
