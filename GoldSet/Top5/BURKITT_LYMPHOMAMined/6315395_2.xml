<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Raji cell line, tsDNA corresponded to 2500-3000 distinct transcription units, arbitrarily defined as encoding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> chains of 1000 kds each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, radioactive Raji cell tsDNA was isolated by a recycling procedure which eliminates transcribed DNA sequences common to both the Raji cell and the Priess cell, and was used as a probe for homologous transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major part of this probe could be hybridized to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> studied: cultured cell lines derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, leukemic cells or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) recovered from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only a minor portion of Raji cell tsDNA could be hybridized to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from non-malignant cells, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphoid cells or fibroblasts grown in culture, fetal and chorioplacental tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a common multigenic set is activated in a wide variety of, and perhaps in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
