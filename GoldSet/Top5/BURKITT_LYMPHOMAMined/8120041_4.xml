<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful entry of the antibodies was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Permeabilized cells showed typical large granular lymphocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and remained functional, significantly lysing both NK-sensitive K562 cells and NK-resistant/IANK-sensitive RAJI target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method was utilized to study the effect of anti-G protein antibodies on the functional activities of IANK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-Gs antibody inhibited IANK cell killing of RAJI but not of K562 target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells enhance the binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) to IANK cell membranes, and increase the hydrolysis of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> in these membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells induce the release of alpha o, but not alpha i, alpha s, or alpha q.11 from IANK cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulatively, these data indicate that putative receptors recognizing K562 or RAJI target cells are coupled to Go in IANK cells, however, only Gs seems to be coupled to receptors recognizing RAJI target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results point out the importance of Gs protein as a mediator of cellular cytotoxicity of the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effector cells </plain></SENT>
