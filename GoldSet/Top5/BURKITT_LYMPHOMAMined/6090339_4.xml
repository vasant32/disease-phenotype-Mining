<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The size classes of the Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-induced nuclear antigen (EB-NA) have been determined in EBV-carrying sublines of two originally EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, converted in vitro by two different EBV substrains, and in somatic hybrids between two EBV-carrying cell lines or between an EBV-positive and an EBV-negative line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Partially purified EBNA components were detected by Western blotting and subsequent exposure to antiserum/alkaline-phosphatase-coupled protein A complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Converted Ramos and BJAB sublines contained the main EBNA components characteristic for the virus donor strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EBNA components of the Ramos and BJAB cells converted by P3HR-1 virus were similar to each other and to the components of the P3HR-1 donor cell, whereas the EBNA of the cells converted by B95-8 virus resembled the B95-8 donor line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the size variation of EBNA is determined by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parental lines of the somatic hybrids studied (Raji, P3HR-1, Namalwa and Daudi) contained EBNA components of different molecular weight (MW) classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The higher MW forms ranged from 70K to 80K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several distinctive lower MW components also were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The somatic hybrids expressed the main EBNA components of both parental lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hybrids between EBV-carrying and EBV-genome-negative lines contained the characteristic EBNA component of the EBV-positive parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the size variation of EBNA is under strict genetic control which prevails in the hybrids in a codominant fashion </plain></SENT>
