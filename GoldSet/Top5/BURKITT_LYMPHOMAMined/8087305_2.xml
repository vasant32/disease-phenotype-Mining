<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were morphologically heterogenous, CD10 (CALLA) negative, and expressed several B-cell antigens, including CD23, in a manner reminiscent of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the cells also showed expression of the CD77 antigen, carried a 14q32+ chromosomal anomaly, and showed IgM-kappa immunoglobulin isotype restriction immediately after their outgrowth in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These latter properties are typically associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines rather than LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of the L60 antigen on these B-cells was found as additional evidence of altered growth regulation in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was demonstrated by the abundant expression of EBNA-2 and LMP <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell line described should be useful in planning in vitro experiments designed to understand the factors that modulate the growth of PTLD in vivo </plain></SENT>
