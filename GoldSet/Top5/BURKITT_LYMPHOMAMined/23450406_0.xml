<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To systematize the clinical features and histological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients, its treatment and outcomes in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> between January 2001 and December 2008 at the San Borja Arriar√°n Hospital complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information was obtained from 30 patients with NHL and 7 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, with a median of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (47%), diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell (37%) and NHL of T lineage (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> or cavities <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (86.7%) with NHL were treated with CHOP chemotherapy, 57% of those receiving treatment had progression or relapse from complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rescue chemotherapy was indicated in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>73% of patients receiving CHOP, complete 5 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of CHOP chemotherapy for the subgroup of patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> achieved low rates of complete remission and frequent relapse and disease progression, showing that CHOP was ineffective in improving survival, especially in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant differences in survival according to IPIae (International prognostic Index age-adjusted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in HIV patients treated with chemotherapy protocols PAlNDA persists in our environment as a disease with a poor prognosis compared with findings in the international literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of new drugs of proven utility as rituximab and specific schemes chemotherapy could improve these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The establishment of prognostic groups established by IPIae can guide clinical work for the use of chemotherapy tailored to their specific risk and optimized according to histological type </plain></SENT>
