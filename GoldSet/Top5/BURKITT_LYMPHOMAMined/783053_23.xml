<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identity of the immune complexes was established by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient ultracentrifugation, which showed them to sediment between 10 and 19S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As they were adsorbable by rheumatoid factor--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 4B conjugates, it appeared that these complexes were composed of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complexes were retained by Concanavalin A--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> columns and eluted by alpha <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25169">mannoside</z:chebi>, suggesting by analogy with model complexes that the antigens might be <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
