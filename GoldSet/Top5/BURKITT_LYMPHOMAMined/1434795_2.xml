<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, IGF-II) constitute a family of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> capable of stimulating diverse cellular responses, including cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the effects of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on malignant cells, we analyzed the expression and function of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II receptors on B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP ALL) cell lines, utilizing competitive binding, affinity crosslinking, and cell proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The BCP ALL cells bound to each <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with mean specific binding for 125I-insulin, 125I-IGF-I, and 125I-IGF-II of 19.6%, 7.1%, and 4.3% of radioligand added, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Competitive binding to intact cells demonstrated that 125I-IGF-I was displaced by IGF-I = IGF-II &gt;&gt; insulin, 125I-IGF-II was displaced by IGF-II &gt; insulin = IGF-I, and 125I-insulin was displaced by insulin &gt;&gt; IGF-II &gt; IGF-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were remarkable for the potency of IGF-II displacement of 125I-IGF-I and 125I-insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affinity crosslinking of radioligands to SUP-B2 cell membranes demonstrated the high affinity insulin and IGF-I (type 1 IGF) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGF binding proteins were also present in BCP ALL cell membrane preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cell proliferation studies, insulin stimulated a 50-130% increase in leukemic cell growth with a half-maximal concentration of 0.1-3.0 ng/ml in three BCP ALL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proliferative response to insulin was blocked by the addition of an insulin receptor antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no response was observed with IGF-I, and IGF-II was only weakly mitogenic with a proliferative response noted at 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, while BCP ALL cells possess receptors for insulin and IGF-I, only the insulin receptor mediated a proliferative response </plain></SENT>
