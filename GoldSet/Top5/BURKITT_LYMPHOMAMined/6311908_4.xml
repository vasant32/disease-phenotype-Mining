<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific ELISA tests were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One, based on the use of crude extracts from virus producer cells highly induced in the presence of Ara C (providing EA + VCA- cells) or in the absence of the drug (providing EA + VCA + cells) is suitable for the detection of antibodies directed against antigen complexes associated with the lytic virus cycle; i.e., EA, VCA and presumably also MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second, performed with purified EBNA, can be used for the detection of antibodies to the transformation-associated nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tests are expected to find application in the dissection of antibody responses of patients to various antigenic subcomponents, the monitoring of EBV-coded antigens during biochemical purification, and the screening of spent media from hybridoma cultures for EBV-specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
