<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the pattern of expression of bcl-2 in hematopoietic cells is still unclear, we have measured the level of the corresponding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in a variety of myeloid and lymphoid cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> not usually associated with the t(14;18) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis showed that bcl-2 was rearranged in only 2 of 77 patients: one was affected by hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one by diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with peripheral blood invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although in rare cases of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> fairly high levels can be found, the expression of bcl-2 appears to be typical of certain lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High levels of bcl-2 mRNA had been found, previously, in established pre-B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in fresh specimens, the peak level of bcl-2 expression shifts to a more differentiated cell type, represented by the long-living B lymphocytes that are found in most cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 gene product might have a role in prolonging cell survival and, even in the absence of translocations, might contribute to some of the biologic features that are typical of this disorder </plain></SENT>
