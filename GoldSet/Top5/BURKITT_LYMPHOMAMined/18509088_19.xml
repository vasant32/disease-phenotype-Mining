<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas adult maB-NHLs have been studied in detail, data on molecular profiling of pediatric maB-NHLs are hitherto lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 65 cases of maB-NHL from patients up to 18 years of age by gene expression profiling, matrix comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the analyzed pediatric patients were treated within prospective trials (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared this group to a series of 182 previously published cases of adult maB-NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling reclassified 31% of morphologically defined diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as molecular Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (mBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subgroups obtained by molecular reclassification did not show any difference in outcome in children treated with the NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were detectable between pediatric and adult mBL with regard to gene expression or chromosomal imbalances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on molecular profiling of pediatric B-NHL showing mBL to be much more prominent in children than suggested by morphologic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on molecular profiling mBL is a molecularly homogeneous disease across children and adults </plain></SENT>
