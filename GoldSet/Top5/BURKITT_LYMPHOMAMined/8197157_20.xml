<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that LR1 binds to a site 310 nt upstream of the human c-myc P1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation of this site decreases reporter gene expression 5.5-fold in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji and 3.8-fold in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These experiments show that LR1 can function as a transcription factor and identify it as a cell type-specific activator of c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are multiple matches to the LR1 recognition consensus at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus and at c-myc, which further suggests that LR1 may play a dual role, facilitating c-myc translocation as well as regulating c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
