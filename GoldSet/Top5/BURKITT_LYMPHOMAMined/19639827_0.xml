<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge there have been no large series describing Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the maxillofacial area or any other location in Malian children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective single-center study was to describe clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic findings in children treated for maxillofacial Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Unit of the Gabriel Tour√© Pediatric Hospital in Bamako, Mali from January to December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were diagnosed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This series includes 24 children (63.2%) under the age of 15 years in whom diagnosis of previously untreated maxillofacial Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was confirmed by cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated using the GFA 2005 protocol for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 17 boys and 7 girls (sex ratio of 2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the disease was advanced, i.e. stage III in 87.5% and stage IV in 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following three cycles of Endoxan in association with 3 injections of metothrexate and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, complete remission was observed in 37.5% and 16.6% were lost from follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment complications after 6 cycles included hematologic toxicity in 71.5% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> in 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients (70.8%.) presented no infectious episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examination at one year showed that 29.2% of patients remained in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite limited resources for treatment and surveillance, the survival rate in our series of patients treated for advanced stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was about 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is likely that a strategy based on an information campaign to enhance the awareness and knowledge of parents, training of medical and paramedical staff, and improvement of management facilities could further reduce mortality due to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Malian children </plain></SENT>
