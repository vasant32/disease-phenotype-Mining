<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts for induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and modulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related gene and protein expression in response to 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 RIT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 RIT induced an overall response rate of 50% with tolerable toxicity, and 29% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were cured at cumulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> radiation doses of about 1800 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was greatly increased in the RIT treated Raji xenografts as evidenced by cleavage of PARP to the characteristic 85 kD fragment at 3 and 6 h and by the DNA cleavage pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BCL2 gene and protein expression were substantially decreased at 3 and 24 h, respectively, after 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 RIT despite only modest cumulated radiation doses (56 cGy at 3 h) </plain></SENT>
