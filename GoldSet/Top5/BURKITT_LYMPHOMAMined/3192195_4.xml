<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases of high-grade malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of Burkitt type are presented which were associated with such a response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases this caused difficulty in interpretation and in one led to delayed diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional lymph nodes were not involved by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but contained epithelioid cell granulomas in both cases </plain></SENT>
