<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A role of gamma delta T cell of immune mechanism in development of NPC was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The solid-phase monoclonal anti-TCR gamma delta McAb was used to expand the gamma delta T cells from peripheral blood of seven patients with NPC and six healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then we detected the cytotoxicities of these gamma delta T cell against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines including Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the cell lines of NPC, CNE1 and CNE2, at different effector:target (E:T) ratio by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotyping of gamma delta T cells was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: gamma delta T cell were obtained with a high purity (&gt; 82%) from healthy individuals and NPC patients in which 90% of expanded cells were V gamma 9/V delta 2 subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of cytotoxicity assays revealed that activated gamma delta T cells from both healthy donors and patients lysed Daudi, CNE1 and CNE2 cells at similar level(P &gt; 0.05) when E:T ratios increased, the level of cytotoxicity to each of the targets of CNE1 and CNE2 increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These gamma delta T cells exhibited highest level of cytotoxicity to the Daudi cells in same ration of effector to target cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: gamma delta T cell of NPC could significantly kill NPC in vitro </plain></SENT>
