<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a RNAse protection assay to examine chemokine receptor families simultaneously, we analyzed the total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of in vitro <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> cultures treated with purified preparations of HIV gp120, gp41, TAT proteins and TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HIV tat protein affected CCRI and CCR3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression whereas the other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> by-products had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, TNF-alpha was able to induce CCR1, CCR3 as well as CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4 receptors and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor BLR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HIV-induced molecules can manipulate the surface receptor expression of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> to allow for their preferential entry into brain </plain></SENT>
