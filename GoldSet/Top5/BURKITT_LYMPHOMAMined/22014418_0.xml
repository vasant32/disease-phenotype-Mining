<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the development of a biosensor to detect EBNA-1 protein is reported, which was based on a nucleic acid bioreceptor and a <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> crystal microbalance with a dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA probe for EBNA-1 detection was designed and synthesized to mimic its palindromic target sites in the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This DNA probe was immobilized on the Au-surface of a QCM-D electrode, followed by the blocking of the accessible Au-surface with 6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29312">mercapto</z:chebi>-1-hexanol (6-MHO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system showed a limit of detection of 50 ng/mL in direct detection of EBNA-1, however, the sensitivity was improved by 2 orders of magnitude (0.5 ng/mL) when an amplification cascade, employing antibodies labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP), was applied to the system </plain></SENT>
