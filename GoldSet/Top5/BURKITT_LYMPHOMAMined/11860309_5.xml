<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare EBV expression in Argentine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples with those reported elsewhere, we analyzed EBV expression in an Argentine pediatric population with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and correlated these results with clinical course and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied EBV presence by latent membrane protein-1 protein labeling by immunohistochemistry, by in situ hybridization, and by polymerase chain reaction for Epstein-Barr-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue samples (collected retrospectively) from 32 pediatric patients at Ricardo Guti√©rrez Children's Hospital from 1993 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight out of the 32 (25%) non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases showed latent membrane protein-1 and EBERs by in situ hybridization positive staining in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among EBERs and latent membrane protein-1-positive cases, there were 5 immunocompromised patients, with either human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBERs in situ hybridization results were confirmed by EBERs polymerase chain reaction in good-quality DNA from 11 samples, with 3 proving positive and 8 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association of EBV with non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the Argentine pediatric population was low (25%), and this figure rose to 100% when only the immunocompromised patients subgroup was considered, confirming that the virus is probably a cofactor in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> of some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>So far, no differences in clinical outcome are discernible between EBV-positive and EBV-negative non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
