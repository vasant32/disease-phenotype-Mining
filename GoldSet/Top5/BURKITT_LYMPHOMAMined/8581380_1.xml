<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the ability of different bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsmAb) and immunotoxins to deliver the type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP) saporin and gelonin through the CD25 or CD30 target molecules to Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An anti-CD25/antisaporin and an anti-CD30/antisaporin BsmAb enhanced the toxicity of the relevant RIP against the CD25+CD30+ L540 Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, although targeting by anti-CD30 BsmAb appeared eight times more efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two anti-CD30/antigelonin BsmAb, reacting with different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the gelonin molecule, were able to enhance gelonin toxicity against L540 cells and had a synergistic effect when used in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among CD25-CD30+ Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, which were resistant to targeting by anti-CD25/saporin BsmAb, one (L428) was sensitive to both gelonin and saporin delivered by anti-CD30 BsmAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another CD25-CD30+ cell line (COLE) was completely resistant to the toxic effect of gelonin targeted by the two synergistic BsmAb, as well as to an anti-CD30/gelonin immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these cells were partially sensitive to saporin delivered by an anti-CD30/anti-saporin BsmAb, and they were efficiently killed by an anti-CD30/saporin immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the sensitivity to certain RIP, such as gelonin, exists among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of the same histotype </plain></SENT>
