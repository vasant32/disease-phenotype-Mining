<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic variant sublines of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Namalwa were examined with cDNA probes for the different MHC class II beta chain genes and with monoclonal antibodies specific for the corresponding cell surface antigens (DP, DQ and DR antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of MHC class II antigens in the Namalwa sublines (known as CSN/70, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>/45, PNT and KN2) was compared with that of the B-lymphoblastoid cell line DEW1, which is identical to Namalwa in DR allotype (DR 2,4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were markedly different levels of expression of MHC class II antigens among the cell lines: in DEW1 and the Namalwa KN2 subline DP, DQ and DR antigens were expressed on almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the PNT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38218">IPN</z:chebi>/45 sublines, DR antigens were expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells, and DP and DQ antigens were expressed at detectable levels on only a proportion of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On CSN/70, there was weak expression of DR antigens on a minority of cells and no detectable expression of DP and DQ antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When examined with MHC class II-specific cDNAs, restriction fragment patterns of DNA were identical for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines, suggesting that they had structurally identical MHC class II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the Namalwa cell lines the synthesis of Ig and the expression of MHC class II antigens were coordinately regulated </plain></SENT>
