<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one children with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-mature B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> received the ALL-XH-99 protocol treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their medical data, including clinical, biological and molecule features, early responses to treatment (bone marrow evaluation on the 19th day of induction therapy), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in bone marrow after remission induction therapy, the risk grade of disease before the beginning of chemotherapy and the outcome, were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariable analysis indicated that the gender and P170 levels before therapy had no effect on the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, initial white blood cell count (WBC), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> response, early response to treatment, fusion genes (BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> level were significantly related to the EFS (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotype, myeloid-associated antigen and the risk grade of disease were also related to the EFS (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that WBC &gt;or=50 x 10(9)/L, Cmu positive, BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4 positive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> positive (&gt;or=0.01%) were risk factors for the poor prognosis (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The early response to treatment was important to modify the therapy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WBC &gt;or=50 x 10(9)/L, Cmu positive, BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4 positive and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> positive have important prognostic values in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-mature B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early response to treatment is an important index for modifying the chemotherapy protocol </plain></SENT>
