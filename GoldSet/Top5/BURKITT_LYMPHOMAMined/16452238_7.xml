<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these proteins are validated molecular anticancer targets, new therapies aimed at modulating myc have yet to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> (Bz-423) that was discovered in efforts to find new drugs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> was found recently to have antiproliferative effects on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now show that the basis for the antiproliferative effects of Bz-423 is the rapid and specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of c-myc protein, which is coupled to growth-suppressing effects on key regulators of proliferation and cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c-Myc is depleted as a result of signals coupled to Bz-423 binding its molecular target, the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein subunit of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> F(1)F(o)-ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bz-423 inhibits F(1)F(o)-ATPase activity, blocking respiratory chain function and generating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, which at growth-inhibiting concentrations triggers proteasomal degradation of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bz-423-induced c-myc degradation is independent of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase but is substantially blocked by mutation of the phosphosensitive residue threonine 58, which when phosphorylated targets c-myc for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, this work describes a new lead compound, with drug-like properties, which regulates c-myc by a novel molecular mechanism that may be therapeutically useful </plain></SENT>
