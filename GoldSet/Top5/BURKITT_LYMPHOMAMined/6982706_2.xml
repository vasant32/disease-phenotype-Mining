<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Production of IFNs in various human T, B and non-T non-B lymphoblastoid cell lines were induced with Sendai virus and the antigenic types of these IFNs were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the IFNs produced in human T lymphoblastoid cell lines (RPMI 8402, Peer, JM and CCRF-CEM cells) were antigenically identical to Hu IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the antigenic type of IFN produced in human B lymphoblastoid cell lines was different in each cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFNs produced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">BALL</z:e>-1 and RPMI 6410 cells were Hu IFN-alpha, but IFN produced in B35M cell was Hu IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFNs produced in DG-75 and ARH-77 cells consisted of both Hu IFN-alpha and Hu IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFNs produced in non-T non-B lymphoblastoid cell lines (NALM-16 and U-937 cells) also consisted of Hu IFN-alpha and Hu IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus the antigenic types of IFNs produced in human lymphoblastoid cells reflect certain characteristics of the producer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factors that determine which antigenic type of IFN is produced have not yet been clarified </plain></SENT>
