<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Plasmodium falciparum have overlapping distributions and are thought to have causal interactions, particularly with regard to the aetiology of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using real-time PCR, we quantified and compared EBV DNA levels in the blood before and after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38068">antimalarial</z:chebi> treatment of age- and gender-matched groups of Gabonese children who presented with either mild or severe P. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">falciparum malaria</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, the prevalence of EBV DNA declined in the mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> group but increased in the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> group, and a significantly higher proportion of the latter had EBV DNA detectable in their blood when they were healthy and parasite free (67% vs. 39%; P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High EBV DNA loads were associated with more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> attacks and with elevated plasma concentrations of both TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more under 5 year olds had EBV DNA, highlighting the strong age dependence of the interaction between the two pathogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that EBV is reactivated during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> P. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">falciparum malaria</z:e> but, importantly, also reveal that: (i) EBV activity persists at a higher frequency in children with a history of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>; and (ii) higher peripheral blood EBV DNA loads are associated with susceptibility to more frequent P. falciparum episodes and with altered cytokine activity </plain></SENT>
