<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus genome is present in more than 95% of the African cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome is usually maintained in multiple episomal copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> integration has been described only for Namalwa, a cell line lacking episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have addressed the question of whether integrated and episomal copies can coexist in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate the presence of episomal as well as free linear DNA in three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of episomal copies per cell were estimated to be 5 to 10 in BL36 and BL137 cells and below 1 in BL60 cells, indicating that BL60 does not represent a homogeneous cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was combined with chromosomal banding to study the association of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA with metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A symmetrical pattern of signals at both chromatids located at the same chromosomal sites in many if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases was taken as evidence for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each of the three cell lines, one site of integration was identified: at chromosome 11p15 in BL36 cells, at chromosome 1p34 in BL137 cells, and at the site of a reciprocal t(11;19) translocation in BL60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Integrated, episomal and linear copies of Epstein-Barr virus DNA thus coexist in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The biological significance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> integration in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
