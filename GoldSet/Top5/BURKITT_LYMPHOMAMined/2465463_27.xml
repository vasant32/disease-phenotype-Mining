<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current views about the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) emphasize the importance of maturation arrest at a precursor cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the CD22 antigen has been identified in the cytoplasm of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow-borne immature B lineage cells, while the CD3 antigen (epsilon chain) has been detected within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immature thymic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first part our study performed on 100 cases of known <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, the expression of such cytoplasmic molecules, referred to as cCD22 and cCD3, was analyzed together with their appearance in the leukemic cells' membrane (mCD22 and mCD3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of cCD22 in B-lineage ALL and that of cCD3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> has indeed fully confirmed the diagnosis reached by other markers, and mCD22 and mCD3 were expressed on only a few cases of B- and T-lineage ALL, also revealing a degree of developmental asynchrony within leukemic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent analysis both cCD22 and cCD3 have been included in a standard panel of diagnostic reagents applied on 500 consecutive cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here the aim was to analyze both the diagnostic precision of individual markers and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of various leukemic types in terms of the expression of membrane and intracellular antigens and their cytochemical features (Sudan Black B and esterases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been found that cCD22 and cCD3 are exquisitely specific for B-precursor ALL (TdT+, CD19+) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (TdT+, CD7+), respectively, while both markers are absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelomonocytic and monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMML</z:e>/AMoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations contrast the findings which demonstrate that 31% of cases among nonlymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMML</z:e>) express CD7 and/or TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of myeloid antigens detected by CD13, CD33, and CD14 is also informative and complementary, both in diagnosing and subdividing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMML</z:e>/AMoL groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peculiar main observation of this study is that only with the combined use of these markers in a microplate assay for membrane antigens, followed by double staining for intracellular antigens such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, cCD3, cCD22, c mu heavy chain, and T cell receptor beta, it is possible to safely establish the lineage affiliation and subgrouping of virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these cases are those with aberrant combinations of markers, including 14% of B-lineage ALL (cCD22+,CD19+,TdT+) and a single case <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (cCD3+,CD7+,TdT+), which exhibit CD13 and/or CD33 antigens, cases with mixtures of ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> blasts, and 1.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> which lack lineage affiliation and can be regarded as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
