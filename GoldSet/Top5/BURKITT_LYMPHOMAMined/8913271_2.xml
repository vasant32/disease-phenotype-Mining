<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study Namalwa cells were injected intraperitoneally into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice and their spread to the spleen, liver and lung studied over a 3 week period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human cells were detected in the mouse tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a human alu repeat sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of BB-94-treated animals with an untreated control group provided no evidence for a significant reduction in the colonization of mouse tissues by the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the presence of the drug </plain></SENT>
