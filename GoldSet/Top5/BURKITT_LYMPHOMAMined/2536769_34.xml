<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, not virally transformed, B lymphocytes with analogous properties, using tonsils as the source of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unseparated tonsillar leukocytes contained cells capable of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-triggered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase-inhibitable reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>+ cells) well in excess of phagocytes (18.9 +/- 6.4% <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>+ cells with 1.3 +/- 0.9% granulocytes and 1.9 +/- 2.3% monocytes/macrophages, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction was also inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33079">diphenylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50317">iodonium</z:chebi>, a selective inhibitor of phagocytic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of surface Ig was equally effective as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> in inducing <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi> reduction among tonsillar leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>+ cells co-distributed with B cells on Percoll density gradients and were enriched among purified B cells obtained by SRBC rosetting twice and Sephadex G10 adherence (47.8 +/- 15.2% <z:chebi fb="8" ids="9505">NBT</z:chebi>+ cells among 90.5 +/- 5.5% B cells, 4.8 +/- 5.1% T cells, 1.2 +/- 0.77% monocytes/macrophages, and 0.73 +/- 0.6% granulocytes, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, mAb 7D5, directed against an extracellularly located <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the small subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>-245 of phagocytes, stained the majority of tonsillar B cells (85 +/- 9.2% 7D5+ cells and 91.6 +/- 4.04% B cells, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> production, staining with 7D5 antibody, and expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the beta chain of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>-245 were further analyzed in cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EBV-BLCL F1 and the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> P3HR-1 both carried 7D5-detectable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>-245 Ag and expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the beta chain of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi>, both in similar amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, only F1, not P3HR-1, was capable of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-triggered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nontransformed B lymphocytes possess the capacity to generate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> by a system apparently similar to phagocytic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase, provisionally termed "B cell oxidase." Discrepancies observed in certain B cells and lines between expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38551">cytochrome b</z:chebi> components and stimulus-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production may be related to an absence or low level of other oxidase components or of the signal transduction mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, production of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and derived reactive oxygen species by B cells may have cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, or mutagenic effects on the B cells themselves or on cells in their immediate vicinity </plain></SENT>
