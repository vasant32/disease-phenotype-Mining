<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to improve in vitro pharmacological purging of autologous grafts, the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (DOX), alone and in combination with mafosfamide (AZ), to eliminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from human bone marrow was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HL60 and Raji cells were mixed with a 20-fold excess of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells and were incubated either with DOX (0.4-3.2 micrograms/ml) for 1 h or AZ (20-140 micrograms/ml) for 30 min or both drugs sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was evaluated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and GM-CFU by clonogenic assays and on earlier hemopoietic progenitors by liquid long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) for 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DOX at 3.2 micrograms/ml and AZ at 140 micrograms/ml spared 1.08 and 1.23% of GM-CFU respectively, and yielded similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell log-kills for HL60 cells (3.04 and 2.95) and Raji cells (3.24 and 3.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the combination of AZ and DOX, the best therapeutic index was observed when the cells were incubated with AZ prior to DOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, AZ at 80 micrograms/ml together with DOX at 1.6 micrograms/ml significantly increased log-kill values for HL60 cells to 3.96 by a synergistic effect and for Raji cells to 3.85 by an additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In LTMC, GM-CFU recovery after treatment with AZ alone and with the combination of AZ and DOX was 59.9 and 20.0%, respectively, while it was 7.9 and 2.9% at culture initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the purging efficiency of DOX is comparable to that of AZ and may be enhanced by combination with AZ </plain></SENT>
