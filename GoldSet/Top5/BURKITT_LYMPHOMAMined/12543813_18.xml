<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This accumulation of the CD20 tetraspan protein in rafts does not change the existing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and phosphoprotein composition but makes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> and the Src regulator Cbp/PAG (Csk-binding protein/phosphoprotein associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24402">glycosphingolipid</z:chebi>-enriched microdomain) transmembrane phosphoprotein more resistant to n-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi>-beta-pyranoside, a detergent that dissociates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi> clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipids</z:chebi> and Cbp/PAG are not protected by the presence of CD20 against the disruptive effects of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-beta-cyclodextrin, a cyclic carbohydrate that removes membrane cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After accumulation of CD20, the activity of the raft-associated Lyn kinase is down-regulated without apparent alteration of its relationship to substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in rafts of lymphoblastoid cells that express lower amounts of Cbp/PAG, RTX redistributes CD20 to rafts but does not modulate the raft-associated protein tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the presence of Cbp/PAG protein in rafts is necessary for RTX to exert its transmembrane "signaling effects." Lastly, redistribution of CD20 in rafts renders the glycosylphosphatidyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (GPI)-linked CD55 C'-defense protein hypersensitive to glycosylphosphatidyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-specific phospholipases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By redistributing CD20 to rafts, RTX modifies their stability and organization and modulates the associated signaling pathways and C' defense capacity </plain></SENT>
