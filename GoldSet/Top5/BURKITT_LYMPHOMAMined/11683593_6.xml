<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure to certain pesticides or organochlorines has been shown to be a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that has been associated with some subgroups of NHL, such as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> related to severe immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we measured concentrations of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> in 33 NHL cases and 39 surgical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 23 of the cases and 32 of the controls EBV titers were also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median titer of antibodies to EBV early antigen (EA) IgG was higher in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> were divided into two groups according to the median concentration for the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For several higher chlorinated congeners increased risk was found for patients in the high-concentration and high-titer group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For toxic equivalency factor &gt;27.79 and EA&gt;80 an odds ratio of 2.8 with 95% confidence interval 0.52-18 was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that current exposure to certain organochlorines in combination with EBV might increase the risk for NHL </plain></SENT>
