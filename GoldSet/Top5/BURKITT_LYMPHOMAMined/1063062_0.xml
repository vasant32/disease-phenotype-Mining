<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic blast cells and cells from a patient with convoluted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> agglutinated poorly in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the degree of agglutination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells was greater than that for the blast cells and also slightly greater than that for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultured cells from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji) and from a patient with poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> agglutinated very rapidly with concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior incubation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types with neuraminidase markedly enhanced the agglutination process similar to that of trypsinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, these studies illustrate the usefulness of this method in quantitating the kinetics of agglutination of various human neoplastic cell types by concanavalin A </plain></SENT>
