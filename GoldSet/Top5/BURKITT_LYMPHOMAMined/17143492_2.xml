<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific blockers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> are now being introduced into early clinical trials with encouraging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and is associated with a poor prognosis in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> however, the expression of angiogenic molecules and its relation to prognosis and relapse are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we prospectively analyzed 46 pediatric patients with precursor B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for expression of the angiogenic molecules VEGF, VEGF-C, iNOS and TGF-beta and correlated relapse and survival data with the expression of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a high <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TGF-beta and iNOS, a moderate expression of VEGF but no expression of bFGF and VEGF-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher expression of VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was found in patients with late relapses compared to patients without relapses (p=0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of iNOS was found in surviving patients compared with non-surviving patients (p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic factors are expressed in the bone marrow of patients with pediatric B cell precursor ALL and VEGF is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention as it is significantly higher expressed in children with late relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of iNOS in the surviving children possibly reflects an increased activity of the immune system against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> which leads to a superior survival </plain></SENT>
