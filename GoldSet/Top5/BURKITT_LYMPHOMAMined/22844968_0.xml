<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results reported here for 356 patients have demonstrated marked improvement in survival through the use of a uniform treatment protocol consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and intrathecal therapy, and the introduction of non-cross resistant second-line (salvage) therapy, consisting of ifosfamide, mesna, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, when patients failed to achieve a complete response to first-line therapy or relapsed early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival rates of 67% and 62% were observed at 1 and 2 years (relapse is rare after 1 year of remission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of interest was the small impact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow involvement on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the presence or absence of abdominal involvement clearly defined two prognostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional finding was the association between CSF pleocytosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029185" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">orbital tumours</z:e>, suggesting that spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system may sometimes occur via direct involvement of cranial nerves in the orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival rates may be increased in patients with abdominal involvement by combining first- and second-line therapy, but verification will require a further clinical study </plain></SENT>
