<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> exist (endemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>) that differ in the prevalence of EBV genome expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> may promote cellular proliferation in endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, little is known about the forces that drive clonal expansion and evolution in the majority of EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study on an EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line derived from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patient provides evidence that antigenic stimulation may play a role in the development and/or expansion of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This cell line (BRG-P) contained a series of cellular clones that elaborated both IgM and IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analyses of the line and its sublines indicated that both the IgM+ and IgA+ cells had identical c-myc and Ig JH gene rearrangements, indicating that they were derived from a common precursor, some of which eventually underwent an isotype switch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ig VH gene sequence analyses of 21 molecular clones derived from the parental BRG <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line and two of its sublines demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clones used the same VH3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five unique intraclonal variants were identified at four distinct nucleotide positions (125, 161, 355, 375), which undoubtedly represented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of these five mutations occurred within complementary determining regions; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in amino acid replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an identical G to A nucleotide substitution that resulted in an identical amino acid change occurred at two distinct points in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> that were separated by the isotype class switch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the locations and types of the VH gene mutations, together with the occurrence of an isotype switch, are highly suggestive of an ongoing role for Ag stimulation and selection in the evolution of the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
