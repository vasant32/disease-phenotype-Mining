<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfection studies have established that the gammadelta T cell receptor is sufficient for recognition of a ligand associated with Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since other studies have demonstrated the need for cooperation between alphabeta T cells and Vgamma2 Vdelta2 T cells in the proliferative response to mycobacterial antigens, we used human, unfractionated PBMC and PBMC depleted of specific T cell subsets to determine whether the gammadelta T cell response to Daudi cells also requires cooperation between alphabeta and gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD4+ T cells substantially reduces the overall proliferative response of PBMC to Daudi cells and subsequent gammadelta T cell expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-2 production by PBMC in response to Daudi cells was also decreased by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD4+ T cells, but not by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD8+ or gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CD4+ T-cell-depleted PBMC, proliferation in response to Daudi cells was restored by the addition of IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data stress the importance of cooperation between alphabeta and gammadelta T cells in the response to some complex antigens </plain></SENT>
