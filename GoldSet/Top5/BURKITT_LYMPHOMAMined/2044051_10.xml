<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases of "conventional" <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (leukemic cells with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration of B-cell or T-cell differentiation antigens) were observed in 26 of 51 (51%) cases, whereas cases of "aberrant" <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (cells with abnormal patterns of B-cell or T-cell antigens or with concomitant myeloid antigens) were noticed in 25 (49%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myeloid antigen-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> was observed in the leukemic cells of eight (16%) individuals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When only myeloid antigen-positive cases were compared with myeloid antigen negative-cases, no significant correlations were observed except for duration of first remission (myeloid antigen positive, 26+ +/- 22 months; myeloid antigen negative, 40+ +/- 18 months; P less than 0.001), and duration of survival (myeloid antigen positive, 27+ +/- 24 months; myeloid antigen negative, 62+ +/- 17 months; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that pediatric patients with ALL blasts possessing myeloid antigens may represent a high-risk group for length of remission and survival </plain></SENT>
