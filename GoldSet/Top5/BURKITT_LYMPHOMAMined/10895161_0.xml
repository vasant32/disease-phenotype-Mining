<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three types of virus-host cell interactions have been described in cells latently infected with EBV: EBNA 1 expression in type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), EBNA 1, LMP1 and 2 expression in most nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (NPC) and EBNA 1-6 with LMP 1 and 2 expression in group III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-lines as well as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines that express only EBNA 1 were found to initiate their EBNA 1 mRNA transcription from a promoter in the Bam HI Q-fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They use a sequence at +210 bp relative to the Fp transcription initiation site in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Fp promoter-region seems to be activated in the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LCLs initiate their transcription from one of several upstream sites, usually the Cp promoter or, less frequently, one of several Wp-promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have now shown that EBV carrying cells that do not express EBNA 2-6 always splice their EBNA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at the Q-exon, while EBNA 2-6 positive cells use either the Cp or one of the Wp promotors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When EBNA 2-6 are downregulated by somatic cell hybridisation between EBNA 1-6 positive B-cell lines and non B-cells of hematopoetic, epithelial or fibroblastic origin that express the phenotype of the non-B cell parent, the parental usage of Cp/Wp is switched off, and the Q-exon is activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NPC cells show the same pattern of promoter usage as the hybrids with non-B phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells use both promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the virus can use two alternative programs, depending on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The "EBNA-1 only" program is activated from the Q-promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cells with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (LCL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> group III) phenotype, the upstream Cp/Wp promoters generate a 100 kb. long pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, from which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the EBNAs are spliced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As a rule, only one of the two programs is used for each phenotype, except for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> group III cells that began as group I but subsequently developed into a more LCL-like cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such cells used both promoter regions, with or without activation of the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
