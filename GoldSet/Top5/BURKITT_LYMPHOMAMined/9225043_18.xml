<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transmission from one individual to another occurs via saliva due to a lytic (virion productive) phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the oropharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 is responsible for maintaining <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> episomes in the host cell and could, therefore, also affect the persistence of the virus in different cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence analysis of EBNA-1 we now demonstrate that (i) in addition to the prototype EBNA-1 (identical to the B95.8 virus EBNA-1), EBV in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals encompasses multiple EBNA-1 subtypes, both in PBLs and in oral secretions; (ii) although EBV with prototype EBNA-1 is the predominant virus in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, it is very rarely associated with either nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>); (iii) EBV with an EBNA-1 subtype (V-val) frequently associated with NPC is also selectively detected in oral secretions and not in PBLs; (iv) EBV with the EBNA-1 subtype V-pro is restricted to PBLs, while a mutated version of this subtype is present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, but not in NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the variations in EBNA-1 may be relevant to the ability of EBV to persist in different cell types, and hence relevant to its oncogenic potential </plain></SENT>
