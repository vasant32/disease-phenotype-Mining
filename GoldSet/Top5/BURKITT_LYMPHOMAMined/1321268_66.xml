<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The only member of the Epstein-Barr virus family of nuclear proteins (EBNAs) expressed during type I and type II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infections</z:e> is EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to type III latency, during which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six nuclear proteins are expressed from a common transcription unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exclusive expression of EBNA-1 during type I and II latency is mediated through a recently identified promoter, Fp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to characterize Fp in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell background, where it is known to be differentially utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a short-term transfection assay and reporter gene plasmids containing Fp linked to the human growth hormone, we examined Fp activity in type I and type III latently infected and virus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggested that Fp is predominantly regulated through two distinct elements located between +24 and +270 relative to the transcription start site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One element positively mediates Fp activity, probably at the level of transcription, and acts in a virus-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second element contains the EBNA-1 DNA binding domain III and negatively regulates Fp-directed gene expression in trans with EBNA-1 in type III as well as type I latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have identified a third function of EBNA-1, i.e., that of a repressor of gene expression, in addition to its known role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication and its ability to trans-activate gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall activity of Fp in type I latently infected Burkitt cells was approximately sixfold lower than in virus-negative Burkitt cells, in which there is no autoregulation, suggesting that there is a fine balance between these two opposing regulatory elements during type I latency </plain></SENT>
