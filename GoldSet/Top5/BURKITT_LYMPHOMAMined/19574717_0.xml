<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several endonucleases, including CAD/DFF40 and endonuclease G, are implicated in DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNase gamma has also been considered to be one of the enzymes involved, but its role in relation to CAD/DFF40 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we distinguished between DNase gamma-dependent and CAD/DFF40-dependent DNA fragmentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that DNase gamma activities appeared in the late apoptotic phase and accelerated DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, even if the apoptotic DNA fragmentation is initiated by CAD/DFF40, DNase gamma is required for the more complete digestion of the genomic DNA in dying cells </plain></SENT>
