<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CDC25B2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase closely related to the putative CDC25B oncogene, was identified in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CDC25B2 differs from CDC25B by a 14 residue insertion and a 41 residue deletion, which are both located in the amino-terminal region of the protein, upstream of the catalytic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examination of the genomic sequence revealed that CDC25B1 (formerly B) and CDC25B2 are splice variants of the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third variant, CDC25B3, that carries both the 14 and the 41 residue sequences was also identified in the same cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three variants were detected in a panel of human primary culture and cell lines, although at different levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In primary fibroblasts and in HeLa cells the CDC25B expression is cell cycle regulated, reaching a maximum in G2-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CDC25B1 phosphatase is slightly more active than CDC25B2 and B3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, episomal overexpression of the three CDC25B variants in fission yeast reveals that in vivo, CDC25B2 is largely more active than either B1 or B3 (B2&gt;B3&gt;B1) both to complement a thermosensitive S pombe CDC25 activity and to act as a mitotic inducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing of CDC25B may therefore contribute to the control of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
