<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a case in which a BCL6 rearrangement and additional complex cytogenetic abnormalities occurred in a child with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed clonal abnormalities of chromosome arms 8q and 14p and other subclonal abnormalities, the t(8;14) or its variants typically associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization with locus-specific probes and multicolor spectral karyotyping demonstrated a complex pattern of chromosomal rearrangements leading to a subtle t(3;8)(q27;q24.1) that rearranged BCL6 and placed it adjacent to MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this genetic lesion occurred as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> due to the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
