<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B73.1+ NK cells, cultured for 6 days in the presence of conditioned medium containing IL 2 and irradiated B lymphoblastoid cells, show significant [3H]TdR incorporation beginning on day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time, a large proportion of the cells express HLA-DR and 4F2 antigens, and transferrin and IL 2 receptors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detectable at high density by indirect immunofluorescence with the use of monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells maintain their ability to lyse target cells spontaneously or in the presence of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By two-color immunofluorescence and cell cycle analysis combined with indirect immunofluorescence, we demonstrate directly that the activation antigens are expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NK (B73.1+) cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and on only a proportion of those in the G0/G1 phases </plain></SENT>
