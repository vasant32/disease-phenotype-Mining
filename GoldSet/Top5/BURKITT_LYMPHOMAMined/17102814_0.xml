<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate pediatric GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> as regards clinico-pathological features, controversies in surgical treatment, role of chemotherapy and the prognostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included forty three patients with pediatric GIT Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> collected over 7 years at the NCI Cairo University between January 1997 and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data of every patient included: Age, sex, presenting symptoms and signs, preoperative investigations, extent of the disease at diagnosis and the type of resection performed, histopathological examination, details of chemotherapy and state at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall and disease free survival were calculated and correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 30 boys and 13 girls with median age 5.00 years (range: 0.4:17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located in the small intestine (n=15), the large intestine (n=14), the ileocecal region (n=10), stomach (n=2), and multifocally (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the commonest histological type (n=24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority were stage IIE and IIIE (22 and 17 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exploration was done in thirty nine patients (complete resections were done in 23 cases, incomplete resections (debulking) were done in 14 cases and in 2 cases only lymph node biopsies were done) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a sort of systemic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow up duration was 44 months (range 4- 116 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only parameters that had significantly affected the overall survival were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, complete resection, earlier stage and response to chemotherapy with p values, (0.005, 0.001, 0.005 and &lt;0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As regards the disease free survival the only significant factor was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> (p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of disease at presentation is the most important prognostic factor in pediatric GIT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgery still plays an important role such as complete resection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, management of complicated disease and diagnostic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is no value of debulking and surgery is not advised for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastric lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy represents a cornerstone in the treatment and offers an excellent chance for long term, disease free survival </plain></SENT>
