<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with diffuse small noncleaved-cell non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were accrued: eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> were treated with modified ProMACE-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">mechlorethamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (MOPP) plus involved-field radiation therapy, and 25 with advanced-stage disease were treated with ProMACE/MOPP flexitherapy (n = 8), ProMACE-MOPP (n = 9), or ProMACE-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with leucovorin (CytaBOM) (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration is 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e> achieved a complete response, none have relapsed, and one died of intercurrent illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with advanced-stage disease, five of eight (63%) flexitherapy-treated patients, six of nine (67%) ProMACE-MOPP-treated patients, and eight of eight (100%) ProMACE-CytaBOM-treated patients achieved a complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the two ProMACE-MOPP-based groups are considered together, disease-free and overall survival rates at 15 years are projected at 61% and 35%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one patient has relapsed from a ProMACE-CytaBOM-induced complete remission, and overall survival of ProMACE-CytaBOM-treated patients (88%) is significantly higher than that for flexitherapy and ProMACE-MOPP (P2 = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adult patients with diffuse small non-cleaved-cell non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may be effectively treated with regimens that are effective in other aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (eg, diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
