<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the position of the chromosomal breakpoint relative to the human c-myc gene (MYC) and the presence of other structural alterations of the same locus in 19 fresh samples of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and 13 BL-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This panel includes the two pathogenetic forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>: the endemic (African-type) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (eBL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (American-type) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (sBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested, including fresh samples and cell lines, structural alterations of the 5' portion of the gene were detected, suggesting that they may be necessary for c-myc activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the site of chromosomal breakpoint and the type of structural alterations differ in eBL and sBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 of 18 sBL cases, chromosomal translocation truncates the gene within a 5' region that includes the first intron, the first exon, and 5' flanking sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in 14 of 14 eBL samples, the chromosomal breakpoint is located outside the c-myc locus, yet the same 5' sequences are affected by several mutations identifiable by restriction enzyme polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different genetic mechanisms may therefore be involved in chromosomal translocation/c-myc activation, and these differences may be a function of differences in the stage of differentiation of eBL versus sBL </plain></SENT>
