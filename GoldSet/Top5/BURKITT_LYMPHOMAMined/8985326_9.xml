<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An Epstein-Barr virus transcript (designated D-HIT [Daudi high-level-inducible transcript]), constitutively expressed at low levels in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived cell line Daudi, can be induced with tetradecanoylphorbol <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> or, in combination, to about 1% of the levels of high-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcript can also be induced in some other EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cells but to a much lesser extent, particularly in lines that can give rise to productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>D-HIT is <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> in origin and is composed largely of repetitive sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is polyadenylated but mainly nuclear in location and is highly structured, sensitive only to double-strand-specific RNase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is endogenously expressed in interferon-sensitive Daudi strains but not in an insensitive strain, Daudi 100K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D-HIT contains a part of a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> open reading frame (designated LF3, and deleted in the prototype B95-8 strain), using an internal polyadenylation (AAUAAA) sequence as a signal to specify processing of its 3' end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells, the promoter contains a putative hinge structure, as found in some interferon-inducible genes and c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since D-HIT lies adjacent to, probably even encompassing, one of the two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic origins (D(R)) of replication, it may have a role in the regulation of DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, or in addition via its double-stranded structure, D-HIT may play a regulatory role in interferon pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its promoter could be of value for studying expression in constructions containing heterologous genes </plain></SENT>
