<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Episome maintenance requires an EBV nuclear protein, EBNA1, whereas immortalization of cells with EBV recombinants requires EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, EBNALP, and LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-derived vectors are useful for experimental genetic reconstitution in B lymphocytes, a cell type frequently used in establishing repositories of human genetic deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of EBV-infected cells to establish a balanced state of persistence in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> humans raises the possibility that cells infected with EBV recombinants could be useful for genetic reconstitution, in vivo </plain></SENT>
