<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the role of autocrine growth factors on cell growth of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B lymphocytes, we have studied the effect of E. coli recombinant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>), a homologue of adult-T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived factor (ADF), on the cell growth of various human lymphoid cell lines, either EBV-positive or -negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that, in serum-free culture conditions, exogenous r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> increases DNA synthesis in lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's cell lines, independently of EBV genome expression; moreover, the combined effect of r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> and interleukin-I (IL-1) or IL-6 resulted in a marked increase in DNA synthesis in lymphoblastoid cells, but not in Burkitt's cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> monoclonal antibodies were developed and used to test the possibility of interfering with r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-induced cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the growth-promoting activity of r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> was inhibited by an anti-r-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner in P3HR-1 cells, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line harboring an EBNA-2-defective virus, but not in other lymphoid cell lines, thus indicating that target cells may play an active role in antibody-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> neutralization </plain></SENT>
