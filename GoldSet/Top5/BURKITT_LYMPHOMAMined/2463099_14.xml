<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous cross-blocking studies using a panel of monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies have defined four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> groups, termed A-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present studies, we have further dissected the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by four monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies using immunoprecipitation and cross-blocking techniques, immunofluorescence analyses with a variety of cell lines, and immunoperoxidase analyses of 36 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the antibodies, HD6 and RFB4, have been described previously, and two, UV22-1 and UV22-2, are described in this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that the four monoclonal antibodies show unexpected complexities in their reactivity with CD22+ and CD22- cells and their reactivity with solubilized CD22 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four antibodies, which recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> defined previously as CD22-A and CD22-B, further subdivide these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> clusters into four determinants, A1, A2, B1, and B2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only two of the antibodies, RFB4 and UV22-2, are B cell-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data indicate that RFB4 and UV22-2 would be the antibodies of choice for constructing immunotoxins to treat B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
