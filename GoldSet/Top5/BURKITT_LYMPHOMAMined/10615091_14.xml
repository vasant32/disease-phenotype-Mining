<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This change in plasma membrane <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was also accompanied by a different actin distribution, as detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8040">phalloidin</z:chebi> fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations support our previous hypothesis that electric and magnetic fields may modify the plasma membrane structure </plain></SENT>
