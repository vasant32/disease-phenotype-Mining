<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The roles of cell density, extracellular space, intracellular factors, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by the molecularly targeted drug rituximab on the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values were investigated using bio-phantoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these bio-phantoms, Ramos cells (a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) were encapsulated in gellan gum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values decreased linearly with the increase in cell density, and declined steeply when the extracellular space became less than 4 Î¼m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values after destruction of the cellular membrane by sonication indicated that approximately 65% of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells originate from the cell structures made of membranes and that the remaining 35% originate from intracellular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microparticles, defined as particles smaller than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, increased in number after rituximab treatments, migrated to the extracellular space and significantly decreased the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of bio-phantoms during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An in vitro study using bio-phantoms was conducted to quantitatively clarify the roles of cellular factors and of extracellular space in determining the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values yielded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and the mechanism by which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> changes those values </plain></SENT>
