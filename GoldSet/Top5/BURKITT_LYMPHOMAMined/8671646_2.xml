<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (Pl3-kinase), which has been reported to be intimately involved in the regulation of cellular growth, plays a role in the regulation of these sigpromoted B cell responses, and uses the selective and irreversible inhibitor of Pl3-kinase activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> (Wm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells, at 8 h post-treatment, Wm triggers a transient increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of 16 +/- 6.9% with a concomitant cellular loss of 16 +/- 6.1% from the G1 phase of cell cycle; [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation also decreases by 33 +/- 5.0%, from 37,274 c.p.m. +/- 10% to 25,127 c.p.m. +/- 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at 72 h culture, Wm inhibits anti-IgM-induced FM B lymphocyte levels of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation typically by 47% and triggers 80% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> from the G0G1 phase of cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells exhibit high basal levels of Pl3-kinase activity, as determined by immunoprecipitation with antibody to the p85 regulatory subunit of Pl3-kinase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> incorporation into phosphatidylinositol, which is not significantly affected by anti-IgM stimulation; by contrast, anti-IgM stimulates significant Pl3-kinase activity over negligible basal levels in FM B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with Wm inhibits Pl3-kinase activity in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together these data indicate that in Ramos-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> B cells sigM-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is Pl3-kinase independent, whereas Pl3-kinase activity is critical for sIgM-triggered mitogenesis of FM B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus Pl3-kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic B lymphocyte progression through the cell cycle, such that if this Pl3-kinase-dependent pathway is inhibited these cells default to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
