<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFNrA initiated and/or augmented the synthesis of at least 13 proteins that were distinct in molecular weights and isoelectric properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of several of these IFN-enhanced proteins was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin-D</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although IFN-induced antiproliferative effects were observed at 48 h, an increase in the synthesis of several proteins was observed as early as 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of these IFN-enhanced proteins in treated cells continued to increase through 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least two proteins of approximately 17 kD were observed to be synthesized in IFN-treated cells but not in control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither inhibition of synthesis of any particular protein nor post-synthetic modification of proteins in response to IFNrA was observed with these methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study are compared and contrasted to those of several other laboratories </plain></SENT>
