<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 40 patients with lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of the urinary tract and male genital organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin slides and immunohistochemical stains were reviewed, and follow-up data were also obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 40 cases (65%) were primary genitourinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at diagnosis was 56 years (range 4-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among renal, bladder, and ureter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, a male predominance was noted (1.6:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subtypes of the lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> observed were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (17 cases, 43%); Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>/CLL, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4 cases, or 10% each); B-cell ALL (2 cases, 5%); B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, polymorphic post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> NOS (1 case, or 2.5% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the genitourinary tract was the site of initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genitourinary tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> most commonly occurred in the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> predominated, with diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> being the most common subtype in the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was seen only in the kidney, rather than the bladder, where it is typically thought to be more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although this study confirms the predominance of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in extranodal sites, the findings also highlight the variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that may occur in the genitourinary tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This diversity of subtypes affirms the importance of fully characterizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry and other modalities, which are indispensable for accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
