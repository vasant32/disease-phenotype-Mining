<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The studies described below were carried out to analyze the damage induced by DNA active drugs to episomal (Epstein-Barr virus, EBV) DNA in the Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work: (i) applies pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) techniques to quantify DNA damage on a large (approximately 180 kbp), circular target, (ii) investigates the DNA strand-scission behavior of different classes of drugs on the EBV episome, and (iii) compares EBV episomal damage to that generated in genomic DNA in the Raji cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were treated with ionizing radiation to induce random strand scission, and the migration of topological forms of EBV was measured using PFGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA damage induced in the episome by DNA active drugs was then assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three drugs, acting by different types of DNA interactive mechanisms, were used: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, an intercalative DNA strand-scission agent; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">mAMSA</z:chebi>) and teniposide (VM26), intercalative and nonintercalative topoisomerase II active drugs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rad equivalency of damage was determined by comparing the drug-induced change in percentage of Forms I and III to that generated by ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, single- and double-strand scission induced in genomic (total cellular) DNA by X-rays, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi>, and teniposide were assayed by high-sensitivity alkaline and neutral filter elution techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is a useful technique for measuring form conversion in large episomal DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three drugs effect both episomal and genomic DNA strand scission, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> appears to preferentially damage the EBV episome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The topoisomerase II active drugs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">mAMSA</z:chebi> and VM26 show no evidence of episome-directed damage in this system and, in fact, damage genomic DNA at somewhat higher rates </plain></SENT>
