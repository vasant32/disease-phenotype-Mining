<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of an intensified regimen, TAM (TBI, high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and melphalan), is evaluated by analyzing long-term follow-up of a homogenous group of 42 high-risk ALL patients allografted in first CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at time of BMT was 25.9 +/- 10.4 years (3-41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had more than three adverse prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had a Ph chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Probability of overall survival was 45 +/- 9%, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving patients median follow-up time was 66 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was 40 +/- 8% at 7 years after transplantation and the expected relapse rate reached 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, six after a relapse but 16 appeared to be directly due to the BMT procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the pretransplant characteristics significantly affected outcome after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TAM appeared to be an efficient antileukemic therapy for conditioning high-risk ALL patients before allogeneic transplantation, but was still very toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of TAM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> patients in first CR is not recommended and the real role of intensified conditioning regimens remains to be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
