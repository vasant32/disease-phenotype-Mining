<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weekly stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 3 weeks with the irradiated cells of an autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL), followed by stimulation in the presence of IL-2, yielded T cell lines that were cytolytic for haploidentical B-LCLs but did not lyse haploidentical targets not expressing EBV antigens </plain></SENT>
