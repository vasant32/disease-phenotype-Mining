<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hybrids retained spontaneous early antigen (EA) production at the level characteristic of Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly the more permissive Raji pattern dominated the induction of EA by IUDR treatment or P3HR-1 virus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings accord with our previous results on independently derived Raji/Namalwa hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Virus capsid antigen was induced in the hybrids by P3HR-1 virus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> though at a lower level than in the Raji parental cell </plain></SENT>
