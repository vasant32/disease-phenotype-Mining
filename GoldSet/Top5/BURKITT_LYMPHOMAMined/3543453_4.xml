<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This antibody (anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) was produced by the fusion of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells NS-1 with spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, which were sensitized with activated human T-cells generated by allogeneic stimulation in mixed-lymphocyte culture (MLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resting human peripheral blood T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes demonstrated weak anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding of proliferating T-cells (phytohemagglutinin- and MLC-activated T-cells) and thymocytes to anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> was two to six times greater than that of resting T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fifteenfold-increased binding was observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines bound anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> up to sixteenfold greater than resting B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cell lines of various nonlymphoid origins demonstrated marked reactivity with this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both benign and malignant cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_602'>hyperplastic tissues</z:mpath>, of various origins, bound anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>, whereas their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, nonproliferating counterparts did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> proliferating cells in these tissues, including cells of the placental chorionic villi and trophoblasts, also bound anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines examined, only <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) cells and some cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed weak or no binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This antibody also failed to react with a variety of nonprimate cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> antibody did not immunoprecipitate any protein from <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumor</z:mp> cell lines to which it demonstrated a quantitatively high degree of binding, nor did protease treatment of these lines decrease antibody binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> did, however, bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> extracted from these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Binding of this monoclonal antibody to a minor neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi>, isolated from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> cell line K562, was about sixfold greater than that of any other K562 neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> demonstrated weak or undetectable binding to purified, predominant, lymphoid cell membrane's neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody anti-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> appeared, therefore, to recognize a unique, proliferation-associated, neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> present on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as well as on benign and malignant proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The antigen appeared to be universally expressed on proliferating cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human tissues with the exception of some Burkitt's cell lines and CLL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nonhuman cell lines, except those for closely related primates, did not express <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
