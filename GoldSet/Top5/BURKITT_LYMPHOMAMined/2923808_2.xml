<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over 101 months 27 pre-B children were seen-an incidence in the population served of around 0.8/100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was some time-clustering and 12 of the 27 presented in one year (1987) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 51 patients with C-ALL who presented for comparison were distributed more evenly over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-B children had more basophilic blast cells with less <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had higher presenting white cell counts and serum concentrations of lactic dehydrogenase; two variables which were correlated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards pre-B children being younger and fewer had hyperdiploid blasts, but these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference from 'common' ALL in response to therapy was apparent for the pre-B patients at a median follow up time of 17 months--too short a period for any conclusion to be drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other than immunophenotype, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> has no pathognomonic features, but there are differences from C-ALL in the distribution of some disease characteristics known to be associated with a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
