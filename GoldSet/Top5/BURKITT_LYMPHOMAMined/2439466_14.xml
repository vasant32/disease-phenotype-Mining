<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) identifying determinants expressed at the surface of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells, and polyclonal antibodies against surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, we have found that growth inhibition is accompanied by plasmacytoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assays of growth stimulation of heterologous cells indicate that the culture medium from interferon-treated Daudi cells contains substantially more B-cell growth factor activity than that from control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the interferon-treated cells exhibit an impaired ability to respond to both these autocrine factors and exogenous factors produced by another Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings show that, in the case of Daudi cells, growth inhibition by interferons is closely associated with both terminal differentiation and a refractoriness to growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this system IFN-alpha may therefore be considered to be a B-cell differentiation factor, suggesting a possible basis for the anti-proliferative effects observed with certain human B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
