<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we define the DNA sequences required for oriP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two noncontiguous regions of oriP are required in cis for activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One consists of approximately 20 tandem, imperfect copies of a 30-base-pair (bp) sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other required region, approximately 1,000 bp away, is at most 114 bp in length and contains a 65-bp region of dyad symmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When present together on a plasmid, these two components supported plasmid replication even when the distance between them was varied or their relative orientation was altered, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When present alone on a plasmid that expresses a selectable marker, the family of 30-bp repeats efficiently conferred a transient drug-resistant phenotype in human 143 cells that is dependent on the presence of EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result leads us to suggest that EBNA-1 interacts with the 30-bp repeated sequence to activate oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test whether the 30-bp repeats might cause the increased transient expression of drug resistance by enhancing transcription, the family of 30-bp repeats was tested for the ability to activate the simian virus 40 early promoter present in plasmid pA10CAT2 (Laimins, et al., Proc </plain></SENT>
