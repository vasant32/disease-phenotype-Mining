<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These defects in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> neutrophils are attributed to moderate over-expression of pp52 (LSP1), the F-actin-binding, leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that pp52 is similarly elevated in HCL patient PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Established HCL cell lines exhibited characteristic morphological features like those of fresh HCL cells and showed elevated pp52 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The excess pp52 in these HCL cell lines was selectively associated with the F-actin-rich cytoskeletal arrays in surface projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatments producing radical changes in HCL cell shape also altered pp52 expression and intracellular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alpha interferon (IFNalpha, used to treat HCL) reduced pp52 levels, normalized intracellular pp52 distribution and reverted HCL cells to rounded B cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">Phorbol ester</z:chebi> stimulation rapidly generated hyper-phosphorylated pp52 isoforms which translocated from the cytoskeleton to the cytosol prior to the further elongation of surface spikes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates a direct role for phosphorylation in controlling pp52 interactions with the cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these findings strongly suggest that elevated pp52 expression and/or selective cytoskeletal association contributes to the distinctive <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of HCL cells </plain></SENT>
