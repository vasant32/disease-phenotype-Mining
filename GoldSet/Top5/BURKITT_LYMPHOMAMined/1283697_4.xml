<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We established decay-accelerating factor (DAF)/CD59-positive and -negative substrains of a human B cell line, Ramos, R(DAF+/CD59+) and R(DAF-/CD59-) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, treatment of R(DAF+/CD59+) cells with Mg2(+)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>-serum resulted in efficient C3 deposition, while treatment of R(DAF-/CD59-) cells did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six substrains of R(DAF-/CD59-) cells were CR2-negative, and treatment of the cells with M177 [a membrane cofactor protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) cofactor-blocking antibody] and/or acidic buffer only minimally affected the extent of C3 deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when R(DAF-/CD59-) cells were pretreated with M177 followed by incubation with low conductivity (3 mS) Mg(2+)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi>-serum, C3 deposition leading to effective cytolysis was provoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven R(DAF+/CD59+) substrains were CR2-positive and could potentially induce C3 autoactivation without cytolysis under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both M177 and pH again minimally affected the extent of C3 deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, conductivity altered the sensitivity to C3: at under 3.0 mS, R(DAF+/CD59+) cells became almost insensitive to alternative pathway-mediated C3 deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-CR2 partially inhibited C3 deposition on R(DAF+/CD59+) cells and C3 deposition was abrogated on the CR2-lacking R(DAF-/CD59-) cells, suggesting that CR2 was associated with the deposition of C3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results, together with the finding that fluid phase activation of complement did not enhance C3 deposition, suggest that there are two distinct modes of spontaneous homologous C3 deposition on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case, CR2 or its related molecules participates in C3 deposition overcoming the protective function of DAF/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> and this type of C3 deposition is maximized under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other case, C3 deposition is induced by another homologous C3 activator that becomes functional under low conductivity conditions and the absence of DAF/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These two modes of homologous alternative pathway activation would explain the reported instances of spontaneous C3 deposition on human B lymphoid cell lines (under physiological conditions in the presence of DAF/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> erythrocytes (under low conductivity conditions in the absence of DAF/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
