<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that EBV uses different combinations of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins, known as latency types, to drive infected B cells to make the transition from resting B cells to memory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This process is normally antigen-driven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A major unresolved question is what factors coordinate expression of EBV latency proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have recently described novel type III latency EBV+ B cell lines (OCI-BCLs) that were induced to differentiate into late plasmablasts/early plasma cells in culture with interleukin-21 (IL-21), mimicking <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether IL-21-mediated signals also regulate the expression of key EBV latent proteins during this window of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we show that IL-21-reduced gene and protein expression of growth-transforming EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) in OCI-BCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the expression of CD40-like, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) strongly increased in these cells suggesting an EBNA2-independent mode of regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Same results were also observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Jijoye and B95-8 transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of IL-21 on EBNA2 and LMP1 expression was attenuated by a pharmacological JAK inhibitor indicating involvement of JAK/STAT signalling in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study also shows that IL-21 induced transcription of ebna1 from the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> Q promoter (Qp) </plain></SENT>
