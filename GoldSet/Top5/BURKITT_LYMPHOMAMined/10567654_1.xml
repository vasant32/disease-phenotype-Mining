<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV nuclear proteins EBNA-2, -3, -4 and -6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> utilize RBP to regulate the transcription of both cellular and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the isoforms of the RBP protein in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells and in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the presence of two different cellular isoforms of RBP; the molecular masses and isoelectric points of these two isoforms corresponded to RBP-Jkappa and RBP-2N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fractionation studies and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged expression studies demonstrated that both RBP isoforms were located predominantly in the cell nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, GFP-tagged RBP-Jkappa showed diffuse, uniform nuclear staining, whereas GFP-tagged RBP-2N showed a discrete nuclear pattern, demonstrating differences between the two isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the nuclear fraction of EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, RBP existed both in a free form and bound to chromatin, whereas in LCLs the intranuclear RBP was predominantly chromatin-bound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the EBV latent proteins was found to lead to the sequestering of RBP from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus and to an increase in the chromatin-bound forms of RBP </plain></SENT>
