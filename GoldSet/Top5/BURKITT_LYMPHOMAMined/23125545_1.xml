<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical course and prognostic factors of children and adolescents with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated in the Hematology Unit of Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was made of 50 consecutive cases of children and adolescents aged 16 years or less with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> admitted between January 1981 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the two-tailed log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> (66.7%) and advanced disease (68.9%) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients (84.4%) achieved complete clinical remission and 33 (73.3%) were alive at the first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve children (26.7%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 35 months with the probability of overall survival being 73% (89.2% and 35.7% for patients with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> &lt; 7 mg/dL and ≥ 7.0 mg/dL, respectively - p-value &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">Uric acid</z:chebi> was the only significant prognostic factor at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the favorable prognosis of children with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> even when treated with intermediate doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (500 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival was significantly lower for individuals with concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> &gt; 7 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
