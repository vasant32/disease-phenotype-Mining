<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TU-1 showed reactivity towards Gb3Cer and lyso-Gb3Cer(<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16393">Sph</z:chebi>), although the reactivity towards lyso-Gb3Cer was about 10-fold lower than that to Gb3Cer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But it did not react with other structurally-related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi>, such as LacCer (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer), Gg3Cer, Gg4Cer, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18259">Gb4Cer</z:chebi> (GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer), galactosylparagloboside (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer), sulfatide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">HSO3</z:chebi>-3Gal beta 1-1'Cer), other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> (GM3, GM2, GM1a, GD1a and GT1b), or P1 antigen (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer) among neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> prepared from P1 phenotype red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TU-1 reacted with viable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, such as human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells by the immunofluorescence method, and also with germinal centre B cells in human tonsil and vessel endothelial cells in human thymus histochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that TU-1 is a monoclonal antibody directed against Gb3Cer/CD77 antigen and can be utilized as a diagnostic reagent for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and also for detection of the blood group Pk antigen in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> extracts of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
