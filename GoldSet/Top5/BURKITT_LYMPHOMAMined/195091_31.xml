<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although Molt 4 cells express receptors for EBV, they appear to block the penetration of this virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations are derived from combined studies with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is possible that T cell lines bearing receptors for EBV may express such a control on virus penetration </plain></SENT>
