<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A decrease in HIV-related mortality and morbidity has been observed since 1996 in most developed countries as a consequence of the extensive use of combined antiretroviral therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined antiretroviral therapies had a differential impact on the survival of patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-defining illnesses (ADIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 35,318 persons representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> (PWAs) diagnosed in Italy from January 1, 1990 to August 31, 1998 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actuarial life tables and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to estimate the cumulative probability of survival; the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted relative hazard of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (RH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among PWAs diagnosed after 1995, the proportion of survivors 24 months after diagnosis was more than doubled (66%) compared with that of PWAs diagnosed before the end of 1995 (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly decreased RHs for some ADIs were observed as early as 1996 (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0239295" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal candidiasis</z:e>, Pneumocystis carinii <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxoplasmosis</z:e>, HIV-<z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the last period (1997-1998), the decrease was marked and significant for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the ADIs, ranging from 55% to 80% compared with the RHs of the reference year (1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the brain and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed a low and not statistically significant decrease; these were the ADIs with the worst outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 1995, there was a rather uniform increase in the survival of PWAs diagnosed with most specific ADIs but not for patients affected by primary brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The determinants of this differential effect need to be investigated </plain></SENT>
