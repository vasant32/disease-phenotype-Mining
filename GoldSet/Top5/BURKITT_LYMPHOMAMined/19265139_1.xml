<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most extensive folding abnormalities occur in cells lacking the class I L chain subunit, called beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, this issue was investigated taking advantage of eight conformational murine mAbs (including the prototypic W6/32 mAb) to mapped H chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of class I molecules, four human mAbs to class I alloantigens, as well as radioimmunoprecipitation, in vitro assembly, pulse-chase, flow cytometry, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-pulse/ELISPOT experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that endogenous (HLA-A1, -A66, and -B58) as well as transfected (HLA-A2) heavy chains in beta(2)m-defective Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells are capable of being expressed on the cell surface, although at low levels, and exclusively as immature glycoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA-A2 is: 1) partially folded at crucial interfaces with beta(2)m, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Ag, and CD8; 2) receptive to exogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>; and 3) capable of presenting exogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (from virus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> Ags) to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (bulk populations as well as clones) educated in a beta(2)m-positive environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These experiments demonstrate a precursor-product relationship between novel HLA class I folding intermediates, and define a stepwise mechanism whereby distinct interfaces of the class I H chain undergo successive, ligand-induced folding adjustments in vitro as well as in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to this unprecedented class I plasticity, Daudi is the first human cell line in which folding and function of class I HLA molecules are observed in the absence of beta(2)m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings bear potential implications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
