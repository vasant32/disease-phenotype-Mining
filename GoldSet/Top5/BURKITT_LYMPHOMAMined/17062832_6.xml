<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of both successful maternal treatment outcome and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetal outcome in a patient who was diagnosed with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and aggressively treated with 6 different chemotherapy agents during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 21-year-old white woman was diagnosed with stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> of the head and neck at 26 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was treated with 2 cycles of systemic intensive polychemotherapy, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, ifosfamide, mesna, and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> with growth factor support during the second and third trimesters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She delivered a healthy, premature boy 6 weeks after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a follow-up 1 year after diagnosis, the patient remained disease-free and the baby remained healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> depends on the stage at diagnosis, as well as treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous reports indicate that most patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> during pregnancy received either no treatment or only one chemotherapy agent, and the majority ultimately died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fetal outcomes seem to depend primarily on the time of exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation, doses, specific chemotherapy agent given, and frequency of treatment during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Limited retrospective data suggest that chemotherapy given after the first trimester is relatively safe and does not adversely affect the short- and long-term fetal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> during pregnancy can be very challenging because an aggressive approach is the main key to maximize the patient's long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the health of the unborn child should also be a concern when choosing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that combination chemotherapy given after the first trimester did not result in any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adverse effects in the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up of the child remains necessary to evaluate possible long-term complications </plain></SENT>
