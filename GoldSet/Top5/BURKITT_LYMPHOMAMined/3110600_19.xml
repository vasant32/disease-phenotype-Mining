<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line BL64 in which a reciprocal translocation joins the immunoglobulin kappa light-chain locus on chromosome 2 to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints on the two marker chromosomes 8+ and 2p- occurred 5' of the Js segment within the conserved nonamer and heptamer recombination sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both signals were detected directly adjacent to the breakpoints in sequences of chromosome 8 suggesting that the translocation in BL64 was catalyzed by enzymes normally involved in V-J recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distance between the c-myc gene and the breakpoint in J kappa amounts to at least 90 kilobases on the DNA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one allele of the c-myc gene <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were found in the promoter-leader region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allele is transcribed and is supposed to be involved in the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The half-life of the c-myc-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in BL64 cells is not prolonged in comparison to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc message </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> the translocation occurs during an early stage of B-cell differentiation and that in the variant translocations mechanisms other than a prolonged half-life, such as changes in transcriptional rates, or other posttranscriptional <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing contribute to the high steady-state level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
