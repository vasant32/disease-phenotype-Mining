<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using geographic information system (GIS) methods, 1778 childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and 1802 controls born in Texas between 1990 and 1998 were assigned probable agricultural <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure based on proximity of birth residence to crop fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate modeling was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e>, we found no evidence of elevated risk associated with residential proximity at birth to cropland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an overall pattern of increased risk for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ-cell tumors</z:mpath> but the odds ratios were based on few number of exposed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also some indication of increased risk for non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but point estimates were imprecise and not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have assessed <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure primarily based on parental occupational history or household use, while our focus was on agricultural pesticides and so may represent a different array of chemical agents occurring at lower doses </plain></SENT>
