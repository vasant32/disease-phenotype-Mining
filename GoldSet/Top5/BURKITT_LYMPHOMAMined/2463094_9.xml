<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effect of IFN on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell sensitivity to LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the human K562 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and HHMS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> with IFN-gamma and the Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with IFN-alpha caused a significant reduction in sensitivity to lysis by human LAK cells generated in vitro in the presence of human recombinant IL-2 (100 U/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LAK activity was mediated by cells expressing NK cell markers (CD16,NKH1) as well as by cells with T cell markers (CD3, CD5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-treated K562 cells were protected from lysis mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from LAK cultures containing IFN-gamma were able to induce NK and LAK resistance when used to pretreat K562 overnight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to IFN-gamma but not to IFN-alpha were able to neutralize this activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that the production of IFN-gamma by LAK cells may be of importance in induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell resistance to LAK cell-mediated lysis </plain></SENT>
