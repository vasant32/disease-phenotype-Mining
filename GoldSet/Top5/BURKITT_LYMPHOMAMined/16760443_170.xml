<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is crucial because these two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> require different treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether gene-expression profiling could reliably distinguish Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e>-biopsy specimens from 303 patients with aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were profiled for gene expression and were also classified according to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunohistochemistry, and detection of the t(8;14) c-myc translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A classifier based on gene expression correctly identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 pathologically verified cases of classic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was readily distinguished from diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by the high level of expression of c-myc target genes, the expression of a subgroup of germinal-center B-cell genes, and the low level of expression of major-histocompatibility-complex class I genes and nuclear factor-kappaB target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight specimens with a pathological diagnosis of diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had the typical gene-expression profile of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting they represent cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that are difficult to diagnose by current methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 28 of the patients with a molecular diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the overall survival was superior among those who had received intensive chemotherapy regimens instead of lower-dose regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gene-expression profiling is an accurate, quantitative method for distinguishing Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from diffuse large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
