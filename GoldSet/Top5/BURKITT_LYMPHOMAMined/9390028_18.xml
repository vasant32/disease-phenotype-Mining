<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) is rare in most parts of the world but occurs with high incidence in certain regions, such as South-East Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major histological types of NPC are recognized, non-keratinizing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-keratinizing NPCs, which include undifferentiated NPC, are invariably associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, regardless of the geographical or ethnic origin of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, conflicting results have been published concerning a possible association of squamous cell NPC with the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this question, squamous cell NPCs have been collated from an area where NPC is endemic, Hong Kong, and from two regions where NPC occurs with a lower incidence, Chengdu, PR China, and Birmingham, United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for the detection of the small EBV-encoded nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22 cases from Hong Kong were EBV-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, EBV was detectable in 7 of 19 cases from central China, and in 3 of 7 cases from the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of the virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) was detected in 3 of 32 EBV-positive squamous cell NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV shows geographical variability in a manner which is reminiscent of the situation encountered in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that squamous cell NPCs are a pathogenetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> distinct from non-keratinizing NPCs </plain></SENT>
