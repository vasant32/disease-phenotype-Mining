<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the studies presented here, we have investigated the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on cyclin-dependent kinases in Daudi cells which were synchronized at different points of the cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that the IFN-alpha enhances the expression of underphosphorylated RB protein in Daudi cells released from the G1/S, and this was closely associated with the inhibition of CDK2 kinase and not CDC2 kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed IFN-alpha-sensitive CDK2 kinase activity was dependent on Cyclin E and cyclin D1 but not on cyclin A and was physically associated with transcriptional factors: RB and E2F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment of G1/S Daudi cells with IFN-alpha also inhibited the ability of CDK2 enzyme to phosphorylate the RB protein in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest possible involvement of cell cycle kinases in IFN-alpha action </plain></SENT>
