<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The EDPGFFNVE nonapeptide (NP) was recognized as the CD21 (CR2) binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350/ 220 envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which mediates the virus attachment to human B lymphocytes (Nemerow et al., Cell 56:369-377, 1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluated the targeting potential of a synthetic receptor binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> (NP) covalently attached to a water-soluble polymeric drug carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, the biorecognition of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51759">methacrylamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-NP conjugates by B- and T-cells and the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-NP-adriamycin (ADR) conjugates toward B-cells, T-cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-NP and optionally ADR conjugates varying in the NP density and mode of NP attachment were incubated with Raji B-cells (human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), CCRF-CEM T-cells (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> human lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), and CCRF-HSB-2 T-cells (human lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of binding was studied, the Langmuir adsorption isotherms analyzed, binding constants calculated, and IC50 doses determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flow cytometry studies revealed that binding was homogeneous to both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apparent binding constants to T-cells were about two times higher when compared to B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The binding and cytotoxicity increased with increased amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> per polymer chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attachment of the NP via a GFLG spacer resulted in increased biorecognition when compared with conjugates containing NP bound via a GG spacer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-NP-ADR conjugates possessed specific cytotoxicity to T- and B-malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concentrations, which were lethal to the latter, were not toxic for PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained seem to indicate the potential of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53440">HPMA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi>-NP conjugates as polymer anticancer drug carriers targetable to immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
