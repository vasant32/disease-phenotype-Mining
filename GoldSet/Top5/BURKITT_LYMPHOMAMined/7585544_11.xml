<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the IgH/c-myc junctions revealed the following characteristics: (a) rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> represent nearly reciprocal exchanges between c-myc and IgH switch sequences, whereas in MPs, several hundred bp of c-myc may be duplicated or deleted; (b) short homologies of up to 5 bp between immunoglobulin and c-myc sequences can be found at most junction sites in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; and (c) pentameric sequences typically found in switch regions and V(D)J recognition motifs also occur frequently at the sites of recombination in c-myc </plain></SENT>
