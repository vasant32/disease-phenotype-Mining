<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the incidence, presentation, stage, and outcome of children with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated at our hospital from 1962 to 2005 were reviewed, and the patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> were then further analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 189 patients with primary abdominal Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 33 (17.5%) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their median age at diagnosis was 10 years (range, 3-19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (88%) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (70%) of these 33 patients as compared with 10 of the other 156 patients with abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could have complete resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (P &lt; .0001) and hence had low stage disease (stage II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> had stage III (n = 7) or stage IV (n = 3) unresectable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of the patients remained alive in continuous complete remission for 3 months to 31 years (median, 14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> often have completely resectable disease and are older than general pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
