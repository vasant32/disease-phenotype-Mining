<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence is presented for the existence in this population of several B15-related antigens which together occur with a relatively high frequency of 30% in unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is likely that these variants may include the antigens SV and perhaps Bu recently defined with population frequencies of under 1% in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of monospecific typing sera, identification of these variants may be helped by their apparently strong association with C-locus antigens in Blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these B15 variants has been largely responsible for reducing the proportion of unidentified or "blank" B-locus antigens in this population to only 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings substantiate and amplify previous reports suspecting the presence of such antigens in Blacks, and should facilitate studies of possible associations of disease with HLA in these populations </plain></SENT>
