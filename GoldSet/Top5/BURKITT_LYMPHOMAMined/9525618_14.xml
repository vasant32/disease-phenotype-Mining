<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that the level of methylation of the EBV genome varies, depending on the form of latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of CpGs was analyzed by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing technique in four different cell types representing different forms of latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dyad symmetry element of the origin of replication (oriP) region and the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) regulatory sequence (LRS) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dyad symmetry element has four binding sites for EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a cell with type I latency, a region upstream of the dyad symmetry element was highly methylated, whereas the dyad symmetry element was unmethylated in the EBNA-1-binding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LRS was extensively methylated in the LMP-1-negative cell line Rael, in contrast to a LMP-1-expressing nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (NPC C15), which was almost completely unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methylation pattern of LRS in type I and type III Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of similar parental origins confirmed that demethylation of some regions takes place upon phenotypic drift </plain></SENT>
