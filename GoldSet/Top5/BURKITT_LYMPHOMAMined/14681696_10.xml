<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA can cross the cell membrane by natural means, but the functional relevance of this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed spontaneous transgenesis of human B cells using plasmid DNA coding for a functional immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene under the control of a B-cell-specific promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and flow cytometry in combination, spontaneous transgenesis was documented in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines, and peripheral blood B lymphocytes of the mature naïve phenotype (IgM(+)/IgD(+)/CD27(-)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By immunoelectron microscopy, the internalized DNA was seen in the lysosomes/late endosomes and in the cytosol proximal to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, spontaneously transgenic B cells processed and presented to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T lymphocytes a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> expressed in the transgenic product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that primary B lymphocytes possess a program for the spontaneous internalization of DNA, which in turn imparts the cell with new immunological functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As spontaneous transgenesis is obtained using a nonviral vector, does not require prior cell activation, and is not associated with chromosomal integration, the findings reported here open new possibilities for genetic manipulations of mature naïve B lymphocytes for therapy and vaccination </plain></SENT>
