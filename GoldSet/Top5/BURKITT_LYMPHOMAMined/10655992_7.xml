<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the value of immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) in routinely processed bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens and to establish a minimum panel of antibodies to assess lymphoid lineage and enable differentiation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 45 routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and mildly decalcified in EDTA) reported to contain leukaemic infiltrates on the basis of cytomorphological and enzyme-cytochemical analysis of bone marrow smears (22 c-ALL, 11 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 10 u-ALL (unclassified)) were immunostained by the ABC method with a broad panel of 26 antibodies against various haemopoietic antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Staining with antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase and lysozyme showed that seven cases were either biphenotypic or mixed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (2), or of myelogenous origin (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>)-M1 (2); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M4 (2); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M5a (1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these seven cases had been diagnosed initially as u-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three further cases with no compact leukaemic infiltrates were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ALL was confirmed in the remaining 35 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of revised diagnoses, the total numbers of ALL subtypes changed (23 c-ALL, 8 T-ALL, 2 B-ALL, 2 u-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of more than 10% of blast cells in at least one case was found with 19 of the 26 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive lineage specific antibodies for diagnosis were found to be anti-CD10 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> (22/23) and beta F1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (6/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of aberrant antigens was fairly common--for example, 7/23 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> stained with antibodies against T cell associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical investigation of routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens enables reliable detection of ALL subtypes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">c-ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A minimum panel of antibodies, against TdT, CD34, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, CD10, CD79a, and CD20, and the antibody beta F1, is proposed for the immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
