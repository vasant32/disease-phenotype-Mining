<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising in the sinonasal region or Waldeyer's ring contain the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in lesional tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sections from paraffin wax blocks of 22 lymphoid proliferations arising in the sinonasal region or Waldeyer's ring were studied with EBV encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBER-1 and -2) using in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV was detected in nuclei of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells of five of seven T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and in nuclei of two of seven diffuse, large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B phenotype in the sinonasal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> arising in Waldeyer's ring, two of 10 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (both large cell) were positive, as was a single case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> of other types, including Western type Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and nodular and diffuse small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EBV is highly associated with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> especially T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of sinonasal origin in the indigenous Irish population, underlining the importance of this virus in nasopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Northern European as well as Asian populations </plain></SENT>
