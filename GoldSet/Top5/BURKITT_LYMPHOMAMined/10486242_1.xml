<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a review of the English literature from 1966 to 1999 revealed no case reports with these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here an 88-year-old patient who was clinically diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and who carried both translocations in her peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient refused to give consent for a bone marrow sample, the preferred tissue for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's clinical findings are discussed, although the relationship between the clinical information and cytogenetic findings, if any, is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study of additional cases identical to ours will be helpful in determining the correlation, if any, between the patient's phenotype and the occurrence of the two translocations </plain></SENT>
