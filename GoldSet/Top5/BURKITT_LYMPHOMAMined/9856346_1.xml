<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an initial attempt to develop an effective DNA vaccine against an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, gp350 genes were isolated from SNU-20 and SNU-1103 which are the EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines established in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the nucleotide sequences of the gp350 genes were determined and compared with those of other EBV strains such as B95-8, P3HR-1/AG876 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38962">M81</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis showed that similar high degrees of homology between 2 EBV strains derived from African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, P3HR-1 and AG876, was shown between the gp350 genes isolated from 2 EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines established in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these 2 Korean and 2 African strains displayed nearly identical patterns of sequence variations from B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the sequence of the isolated gp350 genes, which have been reported to be associated with the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, is analyzed </plain></SENT>
