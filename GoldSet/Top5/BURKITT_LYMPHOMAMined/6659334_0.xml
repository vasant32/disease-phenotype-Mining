<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or heated cat serum, as well as heated human serum were essentially identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum was 2.5- to 3-fold greater than observed with heated human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that feline complement associated with 125I-ACG does not bind to Raji cells via complement receptors, but only by receptors for the Fc portion of IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human serum and 125I-ACG can bind to both Fc and complement receptors on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
