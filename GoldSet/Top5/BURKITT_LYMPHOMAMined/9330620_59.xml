<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that demethylation in certain DNA regions, including in pericentromeric satellite DNA, helps lead to pericentromeric chromosomal rearrangements in lymphocytes from ICF patients and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cells incubated in vitro with DNA demethylating agents </plain></SENT>
