<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dynamic instability of microtubules has an important role in this process, and has been shown to be an effective target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several agents that target non-microtubule mitotic proteins, including the motor protein Eg5, Aurora kinases and Polo-like kinases, are currently being developed as chemotherapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, because the efficacies of these drugs remain elusive, new molecular targets that have essential roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells are desired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide in vivo evidence that transforming acidic coiled-coil-3 (Tacc3) is a potential target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using MRI, we showed that Tacc3 loss led to the regression of mouse thymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in vivo, which was accompanied by massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, including the thymus, showed no overt abnormalities, despite high Tacc3 expression. in vitro analysis indicated that Tacc3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> induced multi-polar spindle formation, which led to mitotic arrest, followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar responses have been observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that Tacc3 is a vulnerable component of the spindle assembly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and is a promising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy target </plain></SENT>
