<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Ag CDw40 (p50, Bp50) is a phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of both B lymphocytes and on certain malignant cell types of nonhemopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to this Ag have been shown to act as a potent co-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> for B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the function of this Ag, we have now investigated some of its biochemical characteristics as well as the relationship of B cell derived CDw40 to that derived from urinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> (transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDw40 from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells or from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line Raji showed a characteristic pattern of three bands when analyzed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE and Western blotting: a main band of 47 kDa, a degradation product of 43 kDa, and a dimer of 85 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dimer was disrupted by reduction with 2-ME but was reformed spontaneously from the purified monomers under nonreducing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CDw40 from two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005684" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder cancer</z:e> cell lines gave a similar pattern but formed little or no dimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty amino acids of the amino terminal end of CDw40 from Raji and 22 amino acids of that from <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> cells (HU549) were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sequences were unusually rich in cysteines and differed only in that the cysteine in position 6 in Raji CDw40 had been replaced by glutamine in HU549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition there were two conservative changes in positions 15 and 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together these results show that CDw40 derived from B cells or from <z:chebi fb="15" ids="48347">TCC</z:chebi> cells are the same or closely related molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the amino acid sequence and biochemical characteristics of CDw40 with proteins having receptor functions indicated a close structural resemblance of CDw40 to the nerve growth factor-receptor </plain></SENT>
