<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that only certain parts of the Epstein-Barr virus genome are represented as polyribosomal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in Raji cells, with a pronounced dominance of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences complementary to a 2.0 x 10(6)-dalton segment of Epstein-Barr virus DNA located close to the left end of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A map of virus-specific polyribosomal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences was constructed, which indicated that a minimum of three regions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome are expressed in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
