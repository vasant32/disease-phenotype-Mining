<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry, we have recently found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) reversibly induces G1-arrest in the cell cycle of human lymphoid cell lines such as Raji, Akata, and Molt-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated c-fos and c-myc expression in Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells at DMSO-induced G1 arrest and after release from DMSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small but significant accumulation of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in G1-arrested Raji cells after treatment with 1.5% DMSO for 96 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When G1-arrested Raji cells were transferred to DMSO-free medium, a transient increase in c-fos transcripts was detected 30-60 min after the release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The steady state level of c-myc transcripts in G1-arrested Raji cells was found to be one-third that in the log-phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After removal of DMSO, the level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was restored and reached a maximum at 4.5-6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against human c-myc protein indicated that c-myc protein in the G1-arrested cells was decreased less than one-tenth that in the log-phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of c-myc protein gradually increased after the release from DMSO and reached a maximum at 6-9 h </plain></SENT>
