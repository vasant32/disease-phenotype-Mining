<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are multiple families of HSPGs, including extracellular and cell surface forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important and potentially controversial question is whether cell surface forms of HSPGs act as positive or negative regulators of FGF signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examines the ability of the cell surface HSPG syndecan-1 to regulate FGF binding and signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HSPG-deficient Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, expressing a transfected syndecan-1 cDNA (Raji S1 cells), were used as HSPG "donor" cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BaF3 cells, expressing an FGFR1 cDNA (FR1C-11 cells), were used as FGFR "reporter" cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Raji S1 cells preincubated with FGF, it was found that they formed heterotypic aggregates with FR1C-11 cells in the presence of FGF-2, but not FGF-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the FR1C-11 cells demonstrated FGF-2, but not FGF-1, dependent survival when cultured on fixed Raji S1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, Raji syndecan-1 1) differentially regulates the binding and signaling of FGFs 1 and 2 and 2) acts as a positive regulator of FGF-2 signaling </plain></SENT>
