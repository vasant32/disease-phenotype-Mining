<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The density of lymphoid cells coated with IgG antibodies against one of the surface markers was increased by adherence of staphylococci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells with adhering bacteria were separated from cells without bacteria by density gradient centrifugation in 11.5% <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> metrizoate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were removed from the lymphoid cells by lysostaphin digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purity of separated cells was approximately 95% even when the proportion of a specific cell population was below 10% in the initial mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The viability and the ability of cells to multiply in vitro were not significantly impaired by the fractionating procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique can generally be applied for cell separation, provided antibodies of the IgG class against specific surface markers are available </plain></SENT>
