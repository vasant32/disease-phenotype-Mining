<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, low level of NQO1 activity is often associated with increased risk of developing different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and with toxic effects linked to environmental <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous report we analyzed the relationship between the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by UV radiation and CoQ10 content in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The basal content of CoQ10 in Raji cells was slightly higher compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after irradiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> supplementation in the medium, reduced CoQ10 levels were higher in Raji and Daudi cells compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present work, in order to inquire if NQO1 plays a role in the CoQ reducing capacity observed in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, we analyzed the transcription and translation products of this gene in Raji and Daudi cells, compared to cell lines possessing low and high NQO1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of transcripts of this gene in lymphoblastoid cells was comparable to that observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells (low activity), as well as the level of two alternatively spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>; one of which is described for the first time in this work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the genotype analysis of polymorphisms C609T and C465T we observed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, Raji and Daudi cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NQO1 enzyme activity and protein synthesis in the cytosol of Raji and Daudi cells were undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines the NQO1 gene is not efficiently translated and this effect is not related to (C609T) polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be necessary to find the enzyme responsible for CoQ10 reducing activity observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, this result suggests a careful re-evaluation of data concerning loss of NQO1 activity and polymorphisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
