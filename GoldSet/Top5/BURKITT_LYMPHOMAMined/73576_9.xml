<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal conditions for lethal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> responses in vitro were determined for a series of human lymphoblastoid cell lines by using different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> preparations, and steroid solvents and by varying the cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies revealed that lethal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> effects are dose-dependent and that continuous exposure of cells to steroid is necessary for progression of lethal effects to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even under optimal conditions, human lymphoblastoid cells only exhibit a marked cytolethal response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> at concentrations which greatly exceed both physiological and therapeutically attainable steroid levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are also greatly in excess of steroid levels required to saturate the cytoplasmic receptors of intact or disrupted lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that either lethal steroid mechanisms in vitro differ fundamentally from those in vivo or the pharmacological activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> in vivo does not involve a direct cytolethal action </plain></SENT>
