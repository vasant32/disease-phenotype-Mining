<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed, the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence, provided by others, for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in African-type Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> further strengthens this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
