<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For comparison, a previously investigated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, Raji, and a more recently established cell line of that origin, Rael, were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The techniques employed were CsCl density gradient centrifugation, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> gradient centrifugation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi>-CsCl density gradient centrifugation in combination with nucleic acid hybridization, as well as electron microscopy contour length measurements of purified circular EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six cell lines contained multiple copies of covalently closed circular EBV DNA-molecules of the same size, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA with the properties of integrated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences could be detected between the forms of EBV DNA present in cell lines derived from non-malignant sources and those present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
