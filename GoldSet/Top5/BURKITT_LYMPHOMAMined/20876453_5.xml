<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In line with the B-lymphotropic nature of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus is present in several types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV expresses a different set of latent genes in the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, such as EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) and latent membrane proteins (LMPs; type II latency) in classical Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HLs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that exposure of in vitro EBV-converted, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-derived cell line KMH2-EBV to CD40-ligand and interleukin-4 (IL-4) induced the expression of LMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that exposure to IL-4 or IL-13 alone induced LMP-1 in the absence of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of LMP-1 by IL-4 and IL-13 was mediated by the signal transducer signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and a newly defined high-affinity STAT6-binding site in the LMP-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-4 induced LMP-1 also in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived lines and in tonsillar B cells infected with the EBNA-2-deficient EBV strain P3HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coculture of EBV-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with activated CD4(+) T cells resulted in the induction of LMP-1 in the absence of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells are known to secrete IL-13, to have constitutively activated STAT6, and to be closely surrounded by CD4(+) T cells, these mechanisms may be involved in the expression of LMP-1 in EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
