<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>50 kb of contiguous DNA sequences covering the human c-myc coding region and approximately 20 kb of flanking upstream and downstream sequences were cloned onto a prokaryotic F-factor derived plasmid, which also contains a selectable marker and the plasmid origin of DNA replication oriP of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since these plasmids replicate extrachromosomally after stable transfection into EBV-positive B-cell lines, the gene regulation of c-myc can be analysed independent from chromosomal integration positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known c-myc regulatory elements on these constructs, expression from the stably transfected c-myc gene was barely detectable in either cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of these plasmids could be excluded as a mechanism for the lack of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insertion of the immunoglobulin kappa-intron and 3' enhancers, however, activated c-myc transcription, when placed adjacent to or separated from the c-myc promoters by as far as 30 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that transcription of c-myc in vivo requires additional and still unidentified control elements located outside this 50 kb fragment, and experimentally demonstrate long range enhancer function in vivo </plain></SENT>
