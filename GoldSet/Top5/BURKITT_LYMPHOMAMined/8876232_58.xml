<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we identify a novel abundant 1.2-kb <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, polyadenylated nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>), encoded by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of cDNAs produced from poly(A)-selected <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> isolated from a human body cavity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line 48 hr after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> induction of KSHV lytic replication represented <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were two 9 and 16 nt stretches with 89% and 94% identity to U1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third stretch of 14 nt was 93% complementary to U1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5' upstream region of <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> contained both proximal and distal sequence elements characteristic of regulatory regions of U snRNAs, whereas the 3' end was polyadenylylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was transcribed by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II, lacked a trimethylguanosine cap, and did not associate with polyribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> formed a speckled pattern in the nucleus typical of U snRNAs and colocalized with Sm protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> represents a new type of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, possessing features of both U snRNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
