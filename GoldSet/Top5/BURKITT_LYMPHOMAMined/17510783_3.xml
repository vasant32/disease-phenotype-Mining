<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcripts for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded nuclear antigens (EBNAs) are initiated at alternative promoters (Wp, Cp, for EBNA 1-6 transcripts and Qp, for EBNA 1 transcripts only) located in the BamHI W, C or Q fragment of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the host-cell dependent expression of EBNAs in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>) and in vitro transformed cell lines, it is necessary to analyse the regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of the alternative promoters of EBNA transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such studies focused mainly on lymphoid cell lines carrying latent EBV genomes, due to the lack of EBV-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines maintaining latent EBV genomes during cultivation in tissue culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We took advantage of the unique nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line, C666-1, harboring EBV genomes, and undertook a detailed analysis of CpG methylation patterns and in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the latency promoters Qp and Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the active, unmethylated Qp was marked with strong footprints of cellular transcription factors and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein EBNA 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we could not detect binding of relevant transcription factors to the methylated, silent Cp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the epigenetic marks at Qp and Cp in C666-1 cells of epithelial origin resemble those of group I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
