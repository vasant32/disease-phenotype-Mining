<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Conditions for removing B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from human bone marrow using "immunobeads" (IBs) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IBs were prepared by coupling monoclonal antibodies directly to a new type of monodisperse magnetic polymer particles (M 450) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal immunoglobulin M antibodies, AB-1 (CD 19), a B-cell-specific antibody, and AB-4, an HLA-DR-specific antibody, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IBs were incubated with Rael Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells admixed to fresh, mononuclear human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After incubation for 30 min at 4 degrees C, the IBs were removed using <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33374">samarium</z:chebi> magnets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of remaining clonogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was assayed by the Courtenay and Mills soft agar procedure, and the clonogenic capacity of the bone marrow progenitor cells was measured by granulocyte-monocyte and granulocyte-erythroid-monocyte-megakaryocyte assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a ratio of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells of 0.1 or 0.01 and a ratio of immunobeads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in excess of 75, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of more than 3 logs was achieved with the AB-4 IBs and slightly less with the AB-1 beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After two consecutive cycles of purification with the AB-4 beads, no colonies were found, corresponding to more than 6 logs of purification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of the AB-1 beads, 4 to 5 logs of purification were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concomitant reduction in clonogenic bone marrow progenitor cells was only 30 to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric studies showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell population contained appreciable proportions of cells binding only small amounts of the antibodies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the IB procedure is highly efficient and capable of removing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells expressing low levels of antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to other purging methods in use the procedure described seems to offer several advantages with respect to efficacy, speed, and simplicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By the use of a panel of suitable antibodies the new immunobead procedure may be potentially useful in autologous bone marrow transplantation of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and non-T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
