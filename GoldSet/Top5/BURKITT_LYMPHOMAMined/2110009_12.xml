<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has enabled us to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect breakpoints that involve this region on chromosome 14 and the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using pairs of flanking primers, each pair including one annealing to repeat sequences within the switch region and one of three primers from the c-myc region (first intron, 3', or 5' flanking sequence of the first exon of c-myc), we have been able to amplify DNA fragments containing the corresponding breakpoint regions from chromosome 14 in both cell lines and biopsied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The definitive demonstration of sequences from both chromosomes in these fragments permitted the confirmation of the presence of a translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the sensitivity of PCR, we were able to localize breakpoints in samples containing as few as 1 neoplastic cell in 10(8) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR provides a valuable tool for the detection of 8;14 chromosomal translocations, which should prove to be of value in diagnosis and molecular epidemiologic studies, as well as providing a means of detecting minimal disease </plain></SENT>
