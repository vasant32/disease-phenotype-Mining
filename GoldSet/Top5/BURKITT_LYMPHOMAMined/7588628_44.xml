<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle progression appears to be required for this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> because arresting cells earlier in G1 inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> despite the accumulation of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 also induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in an LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore six mutant genes derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells were assayed for their ability to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when similarly overexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same genes were analysed in transient transfection assays for their ability to transactivate appropriate reporter plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correlation between the ability of p53 to transactivate and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only mutant capable of transactivation also induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines in which p53 had been characterized showed that whereas some lines were essentially resistant to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi>, three were rapidly induced to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three have a single p53 allele encoding a mutant which is incapable of transactivation or (for two tested) mediating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when expressed in an LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis revealed that this apparently p53-independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> did not follow G1 arrest but in fact occurred largely in cells distributed in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the existence of a second checkpoint in the G2 or M phase which, in the absence of a functional p53, is the primary point of entry into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> programme following DNA damage </plain></SENT>
