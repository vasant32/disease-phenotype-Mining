<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Digests of virus-producing (P3HR-1), non-virus-producing (Raji), and superinfected Rajii cell nuclei were fractionated by electrophoresis on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gels, transferred to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi>, and hybridized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labeled EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA of Raji nuclei produced a series of bands on electrophoresis whose lengths were integral multiples of a unit size, which was the same as the repeat length of host DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> DNA in nuclei of P3HR-1 and superinfected Raji cells produced faintly visible bands superimposed on a smear of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA which dominated the hybridization pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were detected in the patterns when total DNA digests from Raji, P3HR-1, and an EBV DNA-negative cell line (U-698M) were analyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> staining or by hybridization with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labeled lymphoblastoid cell DNA as probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the EBV episomal DNA of Raji cells is folded into nucleosomes, whereas most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA of P3HR-1 and superinfected Raji cells is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern of DNA organization differs signficantly from that in papova group viruses </plain></SENT>
