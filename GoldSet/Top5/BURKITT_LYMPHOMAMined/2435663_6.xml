<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work P-Tyr antibodies were used to investigate the existence of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> expressing abnormal levels of tyrosine phosphoproteins and tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 18 cell lines examined, the antibodies identified a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a detectable level of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these were a major protein with an approximate Mr of 150,000 in a gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; 2 proteins, with Mr of 130,000 and 110,000 in a colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; a major protein with Mr of 170,000, tyrosine phosphorylated in both a urinary bladder and an epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>; a 100,000 Mr protein phosphorylated in lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An 80,000 Mr tyrosine phosphorylated protein was found in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> and in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the hemopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> screened, in 2 Philadelphia-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo> P-Tyr antibodies recognized the chimeric bcr-abl 210,000 Mr protein and its substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, one of Mr 70,000 and one of Mr 60,000, were detected in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These phosphoproteins were not found in samples harvested from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gastro-intestinal or urinary bladder epithelium, nor in control fibroblasts and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the above proteins have associated tyrosine kinase activity: the 170,000 Mr protein of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> cells was found to be a constitutively phosphorylated EGF receptor </plain></SENT>
