<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> preparations were prepared from lymphocytes of healthy donors and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was radioactively labelled in vitro and hybridized to cloned fragments of B95-8 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
