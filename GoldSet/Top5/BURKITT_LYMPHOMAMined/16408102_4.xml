<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of genetic analysis combining cytogenetics and broad molecular screening on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> diagnosis according to World Health Organization (WHO) and on genetic risk assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A two-step nested multiplex RT-PCR assay was used that allowed the detection of 29 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 186 patients (104 males (56%), 174 adults (94%), 12 children (6%), 155 AML (83%), 31 ALL (17%)) characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 186 patients, 120 (65%) had a genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular typing revealed a fusion transcript in 49 (26%) patients and cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype in 119 (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 (14%) cases were genetically classified as favorable, 107 (58%) intermediate and 52 (28%) unfavorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 38 (20%) patients, there was a discrepancy in the genetic risk assignments obtained from broad molecular screening and cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cryptic fusion transcripts in nine (5%) patients changed the genetic risk assignment in four and the WHO classification in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 34 patients (18%), cytogenetics defined the risk assignment by revealing structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities not detected by molecular screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Broad molecular screening and cytogenetics are complementary in the diagnosis and genetic risk assignment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
