<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate effect of BARF(1) on cell transformation and tumorgenesis on human epithelia and its mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BARF(1) was amplified from B95-8 cell line by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic recombinant vector pcDNA(3)-BARF(1) was constructed,and transfected into human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE,and expression of BARF(1) in the transfected cells was detected by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth status,proliferation rate,ability of colony formation in soft agar,and tumorigenicity of HBE cells transfected with BARF(1) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BARF(1) gene promoted proliferation and transformation of HBE cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After injected with 1 x 10(7) HBE cells transfected with BARF(1),<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodes were observed in 2 of 6 mice at the 10th day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BARF(1),as a virus oncogene,may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of HBE cells </plain></SENT>
