<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A pilot study is reported of HLA-A, B, and C antigens in 141 East African Blacks comprising patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, either with active disease or in long-term remission, together with comparable controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study forms part of a wider program investigating host factors in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A protocol was selected for optimal testing of cells processed and cryopreserved between 1972 and 1976, largely under field conditions, which employed a two-color fluorochromasia typing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antigen distribution and computed haplotype frequencies in the total unrelated population are given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New findings include an approximately equal frequency of Aw23 and Aw24, a high (18%) incidence of Bw21, and the gametic associations of Aw36 with Bw44, and Aw30 with Bw45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the major group of B15-related antigens reported earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SV is the most common, and there are strong linkages of SV with Cw2 and Bu with Cw3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible presence of further variants at the A- and B-loci is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of B-locus antigen "blanks" in this study is 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relationships have been sought between the HLA antigens and diseases studied: the antigen A29, possibly in linkage with Bw42, shows a correlation with disease susceptibility, and associations are suggested between Bw44 (in possible combination with Aw36) and resistance to both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC, and between Bw45 and long-term remission in NPC </plain></SENT>
