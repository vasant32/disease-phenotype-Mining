<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of human interferon (HIF) on the growth and function of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic proliferating human T and B cells was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis by flow-cytometry showed that up to 2000 units of HIF had little effect on the proliferating fraction (that is, the present S + G2 + M phases of the cell cycle) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells grown continuously wit growth-promoting factor from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, while 500 units of HIF suppressed the percent S + G2 + M of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) T-cell line, MOLT, by 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to 2000 units of HIF had a moderate enhancing effect on the percent S + G2 + M of PWM-stimulated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In striking contrast, a single unit of HIF caused nearly 40% suppression of the percent S + G2 + M of Daudi, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-thousand units of HIF did not decrease the number of antibody-forming <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, and up to 500 units of HIF did not inhibit the total Ig secreted by these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that amounts of HIF affecting the proliferation of some neoplastic lymphoid cells has little effect on the proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, HIF does not appear to affect polyclonal induction of B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
