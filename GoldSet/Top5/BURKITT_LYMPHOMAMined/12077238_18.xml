<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To target NK cells against non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we constructed a bispecific diabody (BsDb) with reactivity against both human CD19 and FcgammaRIII (CD16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bacterially produced CD19 x CD16 BsDb specifically interacted with both CD19(+) and CD16(+) cells and exhibited significantly higher apparent affinity and slower dissociation from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells than from effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was able to induce specific lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the presence of isolated human NK cells or nonfractionated PBLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination of the CD19 x CD16 BsDb with a previously described CD19 x CD3 BsDb and CD28 costimulation significantly increased the lytic potential of human PBLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice bearing an established Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (5 mm in diameter) with human PBLs, CD19 x CD16 BsDb, CD19 x CD3 BsDb, and anti-CD28 mAb resulted in the complete elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 80% of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mice receiving human PBLs in combination with either diabody alone showed only partial <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data clearly demonstrate the synergistic effect of small recombinant bispecific molecules recruiting different populations of human effector cells to the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target </plain></SENT>
