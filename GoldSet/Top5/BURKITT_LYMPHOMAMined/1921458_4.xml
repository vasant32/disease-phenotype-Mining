<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to define the interaction of other cytokines with IL-2 in generation of ABM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that interleukin 1 (IL-1), interferon (IFN)- both gamma and alpha, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) significantly increased the cytolytic potential of ABM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 3, interleukin 4, transforming growth factor-beta and adherent cells were reduced, while granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had no influence on the generation of cytolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-1 was enhanced while TNF-alpha depressed the BM progenitor cell activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IL-2-induced purging ability of BM contaminated with leukemic cells was increased by IL-1, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study shows that biomodulation of BM with combination of cytokines in vitro can be useful in purging a large leukemic burden </plain></SENT>
