<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the contribution of genetic constitution to the development and clinical response of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to investigate the role of EBV and Interleukin 10 (IL10) single nucleotide polymorphisms (-1082A/G, -819C/T, -592C/A) and microsatellites (IL10.R and IL10.G) in susceptibility and clinical outcome in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients, in a region with intermediate EBV association frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of IL10 promoter Single nucleotide polymorphisms -1082A/G, -819C/T, -592C/A, and IL10.R and IL10.G microsatellites were compared in 62 pediatric patients and 216 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL10 -1082GG and GCC/GCC genotypes were more frequent in patients than in controls, and associated to a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> development (GG genotype OR 2.62, 95% CI, 1.25-5.51; P = 0.008; Pc = 0.024) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV+ patients exhibited a better event free survival (EFS) (P = 0.019) than EBV- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carriers of IL10 R3-GCC had worse EFS (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
