<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing of the t(8;14) chromosomal junctions from two eBL cell lines and one eBL biopsy sample show that the recombinations do not involve IGH-specific recombination signals on chromosome 14 or homologous sequences on chromosome 8, suggesting that these events are not likely to be mediated by the same mechanisms or enzymes as in IGH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
