<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to determine whether human B-cell IL-8 functions as an autocrine growth factor, a wide panel of B-cell lines derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (AABCL) (n = 5) and from non-AABCLs (n = 8) was studied for expression of IL-8, IL-8 Receptor type A (IL-8R), and secretion of IL-8 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR and Northern Blot analysis, we were able to observe IL-8 expression ubiquitously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, IL-8R expression was seen only in EBV negative (4 out of 7) B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV and HIV-1 activated B-cell line; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HBL</z:e>-1, was the major secretor of IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that IL-8 is expressed in malignant B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> that correspond to a narrow window in the B-cell differentiation pathway (pre-B, early-B, and intermediate-B) as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD19-enriched B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-8 autocrine loops were not evident since IL-8R was detected only in cell lines that did not secrete IL-8 protein </plain></SENT>
