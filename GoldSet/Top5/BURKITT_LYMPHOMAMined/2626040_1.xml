<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activity of RU38486 has been studied in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells which are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The early antigens (EA) of the virus are induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DXM) in Daudi but not in Raji cells, whereas a growth factor (transforming growth factor-beta, TGF-beta) induces the EA in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RU38486 blocks the EA induction obtained by DXM or by TGF-beta in either cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to understand the interaction of RU38486, we considered its binding to specific receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first investigated the binding of the <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in whole cells at 22 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of specific binding sites higher for RU38486 than for DXM was found, suggesting that RU38486 may bind to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor and also to other cellular structures which we called the antiglucocorticoid binding sites ("AGBS") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To support this hypothesis, competition experiments have been conducted between RU38486 and other steroid hormones (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>) since it is known that RU38486 is also able to interact with their cognate receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding studies of RU38486 in vitro at 4 degrees C in the presence of cytosolic extracts from Daudi and Raji cells led to conclusions similar to those drawn from the whole cell experiments: more complexes were formed with RU38486 than with DXM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the steroid-receptor complexes were incubated with DNA-cellulose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the binding measured for RU38486 was higher than for DXM, we suspect that sites different from the classical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor sites are also able to interact with DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The blockage exerted by RU38486 on the EA induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> or by non-steroidal molecules and the lack of responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> in Raji cells are discussed in the light of the present findings </plain></SENT>
