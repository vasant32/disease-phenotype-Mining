<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This schedule was intensive and included early treatment directed at the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system but was of only six months' duration and fairly inexpensive compared with schedules recently advocated for use in the developed world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients had 'debulking' abdominal surgery, but no radiation treatment was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were a number of complications related to early treatment, some of them fatal, but of 13 patients entering complete remission 12 are long term survivors who are free of disease and, hopefully, cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results represent a substantial improvement over our experience before 1982 (6.9% survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar treatment approach might be adopted by other centres, especially those in developing countries where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> accounts for a rising proportion of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but whose resources are limited </plain></SENT>
