<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination-treatment using two agents, particularly IFN-alpha and DFMO represented synergistic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the mechanism of the synergism between IFNs and inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis, the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> and the levels of 2'-5' oligo-adenylate synthetase (2-5 AS) activity in the treated Raji cells were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not only the inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis, but also IFNs decreased the content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clonogenic growth-inhibition by IFN-alpha was recovered partially by exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16610">spermidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 2-5AS activity in the cells was elevated to 57 times by the treatment with interferon-alpha and further more, the combinations of IFN and the inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis induced higher activities of 2-5AS as compared with those by each agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these results, it was suggested that the synergistic effects of IFNs in combinations with inhibitors of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis on the inhibition of clonal growth of Raji cells were closely associated with the decrease of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> level and the increase of 2-5AS activity in the treated cells </plain></SENT>
