<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blockage of cell division was achieved with 250 r, and an arrest in G2 was found 48 hr after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells unable to divide increased in volume and total protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell enlargement was also achieved by polyploidization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of surface localized IgM and Ia did not keep up pace with the increase in total proteins, thus their density decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was reflected in decreased sensitivity of the enlarged cells to the cytotoxic effect of specific antisera </plain></SENT>
