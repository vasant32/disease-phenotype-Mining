<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic and cytokinetic effects of ICRF-159 and its d-enantiomer ICRF-187 have been examined in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of both agents were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity is dependent on both the drug concentration and the duration of drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug exposure for twice the cell cycle time is necessary for maximum effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity is also dependent upon the rate of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rapidly growing cell population is more sensitive to brief drug exposure than a slowly growing population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytokinetic effects were studied using flow cytometry, determination of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and mitotic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICRF-159/187 appears to act only during the G2 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no detectable delay in cell passage through the G1/S boundary or in transit through S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs only after the G2 block prevents subsequent entry of cells in S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A fraction of the cells, depending upon drug concentration, undergo further DNA synthesis without cell division, resulting in a tetrapoid cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cytokinetic effects were determined in the bone marrow of patients receiving ICRF-187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> dose-rates produced G2/M accumulation in the marrow with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of S phase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient was given a single injection of 1.0 gm/M2  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>G2/M accumulation was observed 24 h after treatment, with recovery to a pretreatment DNA cycle distribution 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that a continuous drug infusion, or intermittent infusions timed to allow the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell population to recover, may produce superior clinical activity with this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A Phase I study of such an intermittent schedule is indicated </plain></SENT>
