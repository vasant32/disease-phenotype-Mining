<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhanced expression and allelic alterations of the c-myc oncogene were found in three <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> out of nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variations in the size of the c-myc transcripts, ranging from 2.0 kilobases (kb) to 5.6 kb, as well as in the level of c-myc gene expression, 5-50-fold higher than in adjacent liver tissues, were observed among the three <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of the c-myc locus were either upstream of the gene or within the first intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cloning and sequencing of the break-point region from one of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed that the c-myc gene was truncated and joined to a unique cellular sequence of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WHV DNA was not integrated near the c-myc coding exons, excluding a direct role of the virus in c-myc activation </plain></SENT>
