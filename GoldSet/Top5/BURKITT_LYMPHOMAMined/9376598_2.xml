<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lym-2 is a murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed towards a human class II molecule variant reactive with both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic human B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that signals transmitted by class II molecules that stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes can be inhibitory for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> growth by signaling activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of nonconjugated murine Lym-2 and a human-mouse chimeric Lym-2 (chCLL-1; with murine variable regions and human constant regions) MoAb on the growth of various human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by using both in vitro and in vivo assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell lines derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, diffuse large cell B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, anaplastic large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were incubated with Lym-2 or chCLL-1 in vitro, and effects on proliferation were determined by [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of Lym-2 in vitro were also compared with those of Lym-1, which is a similar MoAb that has been evaluated clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After immobilization, which enhances crosslinking of the MoAbs, both Lym-2 and chCLL-1 were capable of directly inhibiting the growth of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were then transferred into mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> to evaluate the efficacy of these MoAbs in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with either murine Lym-2 or the chimeric chCLL-1 were significantly effective in improving the survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that stimulation by nonconjugated chCLL-1 may offer a biological approach to the treatment of various human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
