<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hybridomas of the first type synthesize monoclonal antibodies Ma-1, which interact with 6410t-cells, but are not bound to the cells of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cells contain HLA-DRw5 and -DRw6 antigens on cell surface but there are no HLA-A2, -B7 and -<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> antigens (specific for 6410t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, Ma-1 are probably derected against some of HLA antigens of loci A or B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybridomas of the second type synthesize Ma-2 antibodies which react with 6410t and Raji cells, but are not bound to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suppose that Ma-2 antibodies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specific antigens which have common antigen determinants both for Raji and RPMI-6410t cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third type of hybridomas synthesizes monoclonal antibodies Ma-3 reacting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three types of target cells: 6410t, Raji, and PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ma-3 seems to be directed against human species-specific lymphocyte antigens which remained in 6410t and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
