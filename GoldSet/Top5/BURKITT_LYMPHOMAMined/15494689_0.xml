<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To understand the biochemical basis of cell sensitivity to cytotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicine</z:chebi> (DOX), we investigated signaling cascades mediated by c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK1/2), p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B/Akt in both DOX-sensitive BL41 and the DOX-resistant DG75 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To test the effect of DOX on different signaling cascades, BL41 and DG75 cells were treated with DOX for varying lengths of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic effect of DOX was analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total amount of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38 MARK, Akt proteins, and also phosphorylated/activated forms of these enzymes were detected using Western blot analysis with specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis of BL41 and DG75 cells was performed by indirect immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that DOX treatment of the BL41 cells led to sustained activation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This activation/phosphorylation did not result from increased expression of either JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK since protein levels of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in DOX-treated and untreated cells were unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic signaling cascade induced by DOX in BL41 cell was accompanied by Akt dephosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of DOX in drug-resistant cell line DG75 convoyed by dephosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38 MAPK and activation of Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells did not depend from ERK activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The outcome of cellular response to DOX in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines is determined by interference of at least three signaling pathways: JNK1/2, p38 MAPK and PKB/Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The balance between Akt/PKB and MAPK pathways is important in determining whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells survive or undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to DOX treatment </plain></SENT>
