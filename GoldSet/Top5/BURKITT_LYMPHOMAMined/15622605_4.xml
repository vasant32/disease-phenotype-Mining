<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients' records for the years 1988-1992 and a prospective evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> between 1993 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were descriptive and hospitals based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kenyatta National Hospital; Kenya's main referral and teaching hospital and seven provincial hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each tissue proven Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> case the following were required; province of birth and residence, tribe, age, sex, chief complains, physical examination findings, investigation results and tissues result confirming the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL METHOD: Mainly proportions were used to compare variables, however Pearson's liner correlation was used to assess the time trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study registered 1005 patients; 961 (95.6%) children and 44 (4.4%) adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>0-14 years the age standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 0.83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variations documented in the provinces' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> ASR range; 1.8 Coast to 0.23 Rift Valley and increasing yearly trend for both children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major tribes in Kenya consisted; Luo 29.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Luhya (24.1%) and Coastal (16.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient of Asian or European or Arab extraction was recorded in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The age distribution showed no case below two years, a rapid rise from three year 3 (5.6%), and peak at 6 (19.5%) for children and at 17 years (13.6%) years for the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age group 5-9 years had the highest ASR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The male to female (M:F) ratios were; 1.5:1 and 1:1 in children and adults respectively, provincial ratios range; 2.6:1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Nairobi</z:e> to 1.2:1 in Nyanza, the tribes range; 3.5:1 in Somali to 1:1 in other tribes between 2 and 14 years old when also males were more than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Peak time of presentation of symptoms was 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> sites were in children; jaw 51.6%, abdomen (25%), combined jaw and abdomen 13.8% and others 9.6% and adults; jaw (4.5%), abdomen (43.2%), combined jaw and abdomen (25%) and other sites (27.3%) 67.6% males and 42.4% female adults had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> and disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a childhood disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disease distribution is consistent with intermediate risk Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the distribution varied by province, tribe, age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The variations could be due to environmental factors </plain></SENT>
