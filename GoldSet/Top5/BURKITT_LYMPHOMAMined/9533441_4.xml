<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fc gammaRIIb-BCR co-ligation in vitro was shown to inhibit the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx from the extracellular space, the mechanism of which is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human B cells express Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2, differing only in a 19 amino acid long insert in the cytoplasmic tail of the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 isoforms show any difference in the down-regulation of B cells, we have studied the effect of co-clustering of BCR and Fc gammaRIIb1 or Fc gammaRIIb2 on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signaling in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, ST486, transfected with the two isoforms respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have shown here, for the first time, that co-aggregation of BCR and Fc gammaRIIb may also inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release from the endoplasmic reticulum pool of human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both isoforms mediated this inhibition and the inhibitory effect depended on the ratio of BCR to Fc gammaRIIb cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Fc gammaRIIb, the CD21/CD19 complex was shown to up-regulate B cell response by lowering the activation threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have shown here that co-clustering of Fc gammaRIIb with CD19 inhibited the CD19-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the three party co-aggregation of Fc gammaRIIb with BCR and CD19 resulted in a decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response, as compared to the BCR- plus CD19-induced one, indicating that Fc gammaRIIb may inhibit CD19-induced enhancement of B cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data we suggest that IgG-containing and C3d-fixing immune complexes may down-regulate the B cell response by interfering with both BCR- and CD19-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization </plain></SENT>
