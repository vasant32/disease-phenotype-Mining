<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for aggressive B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which unfortunately is the most prevalent group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in adults, the stratification is less optimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling, analyses of chromosomal alterations and functional assays have been instrumental in dissecting these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> to support the distinction of essentially different diseases, such as diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and now start to identify the dominant driving oncogenetic pathways that may serve as rational therapeutic targets in this essentially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, the molecular background and the consequences of the molecular alterations in the context of the consequences for treatment in aggressive B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
