<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antigens exist in considerable numbers, but, so far with few exceptions, only their presence can be demonstrated by certain methods; to isolate and identify them has not yet been possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antigens are, therefore, suitable not so much for the primary diagnosis, but rather, like the carcinoembryonic antigen, the tissue-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> antigen or the alpha-feto-protein, for assessing the success of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active immunization has recently received a fresh impulse by the use of the enzyme neuraminidase, derived from Vibrio cholerae, in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is no passive specific immunotherapy in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As to specific active immunotherapy BCG, Corynebacterium parvum and preparations of these and other micro-organisms together with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15986">polynucleotides</z:chebi>, levamisol, statolon, tilorone have been employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the results are not uniform they are promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attempts at cellular transfer of immunity are not very encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be emphasized that the findings apply to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have produced very interesting results </plain></SENT>
