<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Posttranslational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation regulates the subnuclear localization of several proteins; however, SUMO modification has not been directly linked to nuclear export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ETS (E-Twenty-Six) family member <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> (ETV6) is a transcriptional repressor that can inhibit Ras-dependent colony growth in soft agar and induce cellular aggregation of Ras-transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations such as the t(12;21), which is associated with nearly one-fourth of pediatric B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the vast majority of t(12;21)-containing cases, the second allele of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> is deleted, suggesting that inactivation of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> contributes to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> functions in the nucleus as a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, it has also been detected in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> is actively exported from the nucleus in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52646">leptomycin B</z:chebi>-sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> is posttranslationally modified by sumoylation at lysine 99 within a highly conserved domain (the "pointed" domain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the sumo-acceptor lysine or mutations within the pointed domain that affect sumoylation impair nuclear export of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation of lysine 99 also results in an increase in <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> transcriptional repression, presumably because of decreased nuclear export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that the ability of <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> to repress transcription and suppress growth is regulated by sumoylation and nuclear export </plain></SENT>
