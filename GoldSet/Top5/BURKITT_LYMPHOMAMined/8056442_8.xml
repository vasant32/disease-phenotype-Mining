<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the p53 status in non-progressive and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) by ELISA, immunoprecipitation, FACS and cDNA sequencing in relation to in vitro proliferation in response to Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) and IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In FACS, cells from progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> were found to over-express p53 with a conformation recognized by PAB240 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a PAb240-based ELISA, 60% of progressive B-CLL were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of p53 exons 5 to 9 revealed a codon 179 His to Gln change in one of the ELISA-positive, progressive B-CLL but failed to reveal any mutations in 4 other ELISA-positive, progressive B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among progressive B-CLL populations, 10/14 responded by proliferation in vitro to SAC/IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In non-progressive cells, low levels of p53 were found by FACS, none was positive in the PAb240 ELISA and only one case showed a weak proliferative response to SAC/IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low p53 expression was also seen in different types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, resting and activated, and in EBV-transformed B-cell lines, in contrast to the high expression observed in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with verified p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that progressive B-CLL is characterized by aberrant p53 expression which may be a significant prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
