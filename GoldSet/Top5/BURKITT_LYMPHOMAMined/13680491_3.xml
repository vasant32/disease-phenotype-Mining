<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of surgery in intraabdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains controversial and different opinions are present in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our institution, forty patients (30 boys and 10 girls) with intraabdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with ages ranging from 3 to 12 years have been treated and followed from 1989 through 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ten cases, the patients underwent surgery because of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdominal diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> in 5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in 3, intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">appendicitis</z:e> in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining thirty patients were referred to our clinic because of their abdominal masses, pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve children had localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and total resection could be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this group due to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 28 children, extensive intraabdominal diseases were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four of them, debulking procedures were performed, while in 24 children only biopsies could be made; 8 of them underwent a second-look operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the debulking procedures group, two children were lost (50 %) due to tumorlysis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the biopsy group, there were six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (25 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received chemotherapy after operative recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is localized, total resection results in a good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of extensive intraabdominal diseases instead of resection, the operation should be limited to biopsy only </plain></SENT>
