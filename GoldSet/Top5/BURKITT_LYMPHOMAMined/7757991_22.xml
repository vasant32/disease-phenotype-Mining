<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated temporal relationships between ionizing radiation-induced G1 arrest and induction of the p53-regulated genes GADD45, CIP1/WAF1, and MDM2 in a series of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines that differed in p53 gene status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emphasis was placed on characterization of the EW36 cell line, which despite expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 genes, is defective in G1 arrest following gamma-irradiation (P </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of CIP1/WAF1, GADD45, and to a lesser extent MDM2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 lines that arrested in G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that contained only mutant p53 genes or were heterozygous for p53 mutations failed to induce appreciable levels of these p53-regulated transcripts and did not arrest in G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G1 arrest in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 cell line WMN was more prolonged than elevation of CIP1/WAF1, GADD45, or MDM2 transcripts, suggesting that G1 arrest duration must be dependent upon stability of these newly synthesized proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In agreement, we found that p21Cip1/Waf1, a potent inhibitor of G1-S phase cyclin-dependent kinases, was maintained at elevated levels throughout the period that WMN cells remained arrested in G1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Investigations into the stability of p53 and p21Cip1/Waf1 revealed that EW36 cells failed to maintain elevated levels of these proteins following irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>p53 levels decreased within 4 h of irradiation, and p21Cip1/Waf1 levels decreased shortly after the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> decline of CIP1/WAF1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Degradation of p21Cip1/Waf1 coincided with the escape of EW36 cells from G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that p21Cip1/Waf1 stability may determine G1 arrest duration and that premature degradation of this protein could provide an alternative route to subversion of the G1 checkpoint in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
