<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> preparations were compared for their ability to infect the same EBV-genome-negative lymphoblastoid cell line, BJA-B, they induced approximately the same number of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA is compatibile with continued cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No early antigen (EA)-positive cells appeared in the B95-8 virus-infected cultures, whereas P3HR-1 virus-infected cells went on to express EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EA signals the entry of the cell into the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No late <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen (VCA) appeared and, as a consequence, the P3HR-1 virus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> became abortive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the EBNA-positive cells induced by the B95-8 virus continued to divide over several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that different EBV isolates may differ in their biological activity, probably due to their having different degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> dependence on restrictive host cell controls </plain></SENT>
