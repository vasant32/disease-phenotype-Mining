<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substantial evidence has implicated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the aetiology of two human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the presence of high antibody titres to EBV early antigen and virus capsid antigen, as well as antibody to two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-associated enzymes, DNase and DNA polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with NPC, particularly the undifferentiated form, are commonly found to have EBV DNA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ito and others have presented strong epidemiological evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> are related to the unusual geographic distribution of NPC in southeastern regions of China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a close link between the widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of the Asian population and the distinct regional distribution in China of plants that produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35190">diterpene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> are produced by plants of the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae, which are used as traditional herbal medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it has been established that EBV can infect epithelial cells isolated from NPC as well as certain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epithelial cells, there has been no in vitro evidence that EBV induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human epithelial cells with or without exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report here evidence that transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human epithelial cells results from exposure to infectious EBV and that transformation is dependent on the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
