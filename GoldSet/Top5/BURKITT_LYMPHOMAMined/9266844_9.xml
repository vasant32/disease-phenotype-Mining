<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five different human alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase genes, the Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TIV, Fuc-TV, Fuc-TVI and Fuc-TVII genes, have been cloned to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We transfected HeLa cells and Namalwa cells with each of the five different genes, and established a series of stable cloned transformant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thin-layer chromatography immunostaining analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five enzymes were able to synthesize sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> in HeLa cells, but each enzyme showed a different preference as to the carbohydrate chain length on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> as acceptor substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV showed very similar patterns of sLe(x) positive bands, which indicated that the enzymes have similar acceptor substrate specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fuc-TVI exhibited a little different pattern from those of the former two enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII showed similarity in the positive bands, however, their patterns were quite different from those of the former three enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four enzymes except for Fuc-TVII were able to synthesize the Lewis x (Le(x)) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fuc-TV alone showed a little different pattern of Le(x) positive bands from those of the other three enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of HeLa cells and Namalwa cells again demonstrated the similar specificities of Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They exhibited similar stronger staining with FH6 (anti-sLe(x)) antibodies than that with the other enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A phylogenetic tree of the five enzymes constructed using the neighbor-joining method showed good agreement with the similarities in the enzyme substrate specificity </plain></SENT>
