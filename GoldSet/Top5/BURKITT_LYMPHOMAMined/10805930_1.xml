<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since the description of long podia extended by hematopoietic cells and cell lines, the reliable elicitation of podia extensions is needed to study these podia systemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, hyperosmotic stress was considered as an elicitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using two fluorescent membrane dyes PKH2 and PKH26, and an automated fluorescence microscopy system, morphological changes of seven human cell lines (six hematopoietic, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo>) at different osmolalities were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presence of surface molecules on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperosmolality</z:e>-induced podia (osmopodia) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In hyperosmotic medium, cells shrank rapidly, followed by osmopodia extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells exhibited variable number (up to five) and length (up to longer than 100 microm) of osmopodia in about 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dead cells did not extend podia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequency, length, and number of podia were variable among cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD44 and CD45 were not present on the osmopodia, although they were present on the cell surface, showing that osmopodia characteristics differ from the podia observed previously in isotonic media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The osmopodia extension process was shown to be reversible upon repeated osmolality changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Osmopodia extended by human hematopoietic cell lines display a newly observed cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and provide a tool for investigation of dynamic cellular response to environmental changes </plain></SENT>
