<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations within the p53 gene cause stabilization and therefore increased steady-state levels of the p53 protein; some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, also result in the generation of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by the antibody pAB240 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown here that in 70% of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, but not in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EBV transformed B cell lines, p53 protein is readily detectable by Western blot analysis using either an antibody directed against the 240 epitope or an antibody against <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic analysis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines demonstrated the presence of mutations within the p53 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines with detectable p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that in the cell lines ST486, Raji, and TE 110, which are heterozygous for a neutral sequence codon polymorphism (Arg/Pro) that causes altered migration of an otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein and also contain a heterozygous mutation, only the protein derived from the mutated allele is stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus the dominant effect of the mutations present in these cell lines apparently does not result from sequestering of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> protein by the abnormal protein, and therefore presumably is a consequence of a gain-of-function resulting from the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines with stabilized p53 also contained p53 mutations, three <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> (two cell lines and one fresh B-CLL) with a heterozygous mutation at codon 248 did not express elevated levels of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p53 was readily detectable in Western blot analysis from cell lines KK124, Namalwa, and CA46, which had homo- or hemizygous mutations at codon 248, and from PP1084, a cell line with a codon 273 mutation and a carboxyl-terminal truncation in the other allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mutations at codon 248, unlike those in cell lines ST486 and TE110, are stabilizing only in the absence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous mutations at codons 248 have been described in the germline of individuals belonging to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-prone families described by Li and Fraumeni (see ref 18), but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> detected in such individuals are homozygous, i.e., contain only mutated p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the possibility that such mutations exert a pathogenetic effect only in the absence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein, and are coupled to our findings that stabilization of p53 is a necessary component of the oncogenic pathways relevant to p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, whereas some mutations are stabilizing in the presence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> p53 protein, others are stabilizing only in the homozygous state </plain></SENT>
