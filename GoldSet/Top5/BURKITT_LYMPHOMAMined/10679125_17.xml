<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike many other EBV proteins, LMP-1 Abs have rarely been demonstrated in EBV-associated disease conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We established a high level LMP-1-expressing cell clone and used it for the detection, quantitation, and characterization of these Abs in various human sera in immunoblots and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to the commonly held notion, LMP-1 induces significant humoral immune responses in EBV-associated malignant conditions especially in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) patients in whom &gt;70% sera are positive for these Abs, and their titers correlate with the clinical condition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, anti-LMP-1 Abs of IgA isotype were found only in NPC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These Abs were absent from the sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> patients, whereas a small fraction ( approximately 5%) of the healthy, EBV-seropositive individuals were positive for them; however, their OD values were much lower than those of NPC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate, for the first time, the potential significance of LMP-1-specific Abs for the diagnosis and prognosis of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, especially of NPC </plain></SENT>
