<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapy with rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, Rituxan), alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy, has significantly improved the treatment outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Via an elusive mechanism, a subpopulation of patients becomes unresponsive and/or relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To recapitulate various aspects of acquired resistance, rituximab-resistant (RR) clones were established from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and compared with parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface CD20 expression was diminished in the clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clones neither responded to rituximab-mediated growth reduction or complement-dependent cytotoxicity nor underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to cross-linked rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab failed to chemosensitize the RR clones, which exhibited constitutive hyperactivation of the nuclear factor-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways, leading to overexpression of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-related gene (long alternatively spliced variant of Bcl-x gene), and myeloid cell differentiation 1 and higher drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike parental cells, rituximab neither inhibited the activity of these pathways nor diminished the expression of resistant factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibitors of the survival pathways or Bcl-2 family members reduced the activity of these pathways, diminished antiapoptotic protein expression, and chemosensitized the RR clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These novel in vitro results denote that continuous long-term rituximab exposure culminates in RR clones that do not respond to rituximab-mediated effects, have altered cellular signaling dynamics, and exhibit different genetic and phenotypic properties compared with parental cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data also reveal that although RR clones exhibit higher resistance to rituximab and cytotoxic drugs, these clones can be chemosensitized following treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors (e.g., dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi>, PD098059) that target survival/antiapoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings also identify intracellular targets for potential molecular therapeutic intervention to increase treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significance and potential clinical relevance of the findings are discussed </plain></SENT>
