<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) is increasing, in which most are aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is limited for promoting the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy on NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, mouse models of B-cell NHL were established for determining the efficacy and mechanisms of novel therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> SU-DHL-4 cells and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells were injected into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>) mice through the tail veins to observe the presentations and requirements for establishing mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Daudi-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> mice were divided into control group and rituximab group, and the latter received treatment of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and survival time of mice were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time of SU-DHL-4-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was 39.5 days, which presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, erect hair, tardiness and enlarged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the abdomen, rump or pelvic limb, but without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell infiltration in the liver, spleen or bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time of Daudi-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was 30.5 days, which were characterized by paralyzed lower limbs and died about 9.5 days after paralysation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most organs such as the liver, kidney, spleen and bone marrow were infiltrated by a number of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment of rituximab, Daudi cells presented typical characteristics of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> time and survival time of mice with Daudi-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were significantly longer in rituximab group than in control group (52.5 days vs. 30.5 days, 76.5 days vs. 40 days, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mouse models of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be successfully established with either SU-DHL-4 cells or Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
