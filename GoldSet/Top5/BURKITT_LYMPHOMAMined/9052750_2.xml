<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction has been used to analyze the expression of 2 latent genes (EBNA-1 and LMP-1) and one replicative gene (BZLF-1) of Epstein-Barr virus in mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-gene transcription was detected in 8 out of 15 bone-marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these, 5 allowed the detection of latency-associated transcripts in the absence of BZLF-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one sample showed positivity for expression of both latent and lytic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, BZLF-1 was the only transcript detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In peripheral blood, 4 out of 7 samples showed evidence of EBNA-1 transcription; LMP-1 was expressed in 5 samples, and in 2 cases concomitant expression of EBNA-1 and BZLF-1 was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide a direct demonstration by RT-PCR of EBV-gene transcription in bone-marrow-resident <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> infected cells and suggest, in contrast to previous studies on peripheral blood, that LMP-1 and BZLF-1 are frequently transcribed also in absence of EBV-related disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression found makes it difficult to define a pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency in vivo which coincides with that described for lymphoblastoid or Burkitt's-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines at different stages of differentiation </plain></SENT>
