<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of human lymphoblastoid cells were examined concerning their ability to produce spontaneously liberated and virus-induced interferon (IFN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that, in addition to B cells, various T and nonT-nonB lymphoblastoid cells responded well to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sendai virus infection</z:e> to form IFN, the characterization of which has been recently reported (20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One B lymphoblastoid cell line from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) patient produced a large amount of IFN-alpha and might become an alternative source of IFN production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 68 cell lines examined, 35 cell lines liberated 10 U/ml or more of IFN spontaneously in culture fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome or its activation appears to have no correlation with the spontaneous liberation of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously produced IFN from three cell lines was characterized as IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparatively higher amounts of IFN were produced in cells from IM patients than those from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases or healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously produced IFN was detected more easily in cells transformed by EBV alone than in those transformed by EBV and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
