<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result of virological studies, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been demonstrated in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested biopsies of African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This contrasts to the absence of EBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, or almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of the non-African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, even though the number of tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in this group is small, and to the lack of EBV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological studies have revealed the presence of antibodies to different EBV-associated antigens in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> African patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However the antibodies are not specific for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but are found in most adults <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world, although at lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They cannot therefore serve diagnostic purposes, but they can give prognostic information and occasionally give clues to the mechanisms behind late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrences, and possibly guide so-called immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients contrast to appropriate control groups where some of the persons are anti-EBV seronegative, and this, together with the presence of EBV in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsies and the absence of EBV in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, even though the cell type involved may be infectable by EBV in vitro and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> may arise in an EBV-carrying person, favors an etiological role in EBV in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and speaks against the "passenger" hypothesis, according to which EBV is picked up by the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell which happens to be particularly suitable for EBV persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To explain the geographical distribution, a cofactor, such as certain forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>, has been implied </plain></SENT>
