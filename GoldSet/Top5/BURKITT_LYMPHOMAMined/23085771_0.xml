<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most potent derivatives against human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ramos) cells displayed IC(50) values below 8 μM, and low toxicity against human red blood cells (EC(50) &gt; 200 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A more than 5-fold preference for Ramos <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells compared to human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) was also obtained for the most promising β(2,2)-amino acid derivative 3-amino-N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22502">2-aminoethyl</z:chebi>)-2,2-bis(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16482">naphthalen</z:chebi>-2-ylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45422">propanamide</z:chebi> (5c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening of 5c at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute (NCI, USA) confirmed its anticancer potency and revealed a very broad range of anticancer activity with IC(50) values of 0.32-3.89 μM against 59 different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highest potency was obtained against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines included in the NCI screening panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reported β(2,2)-amino acid derivatives constitute a promising new class of anticancer agents based on their high anticancer potency, ease of synthesis, mode-of-action, and optimized pharmacokinetic properties compared to much larger antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
