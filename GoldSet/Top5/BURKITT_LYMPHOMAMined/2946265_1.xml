<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> OS-RC-2 cells were sensitive to IFN alpha-2b, whereas two EB-virus-transformed B cell lines, FS and L-KT3, and human A375 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cells showed low or no sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>125I-IFN alpha-2b binding assay revealed that the difference in IFN alpha-2b sensitivity was related to the number and the affinity of IFN alpha-2b receptors per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were then performed to investigate the influence of recombinant IFN alpha-2b on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> activity of monocytes against A375 cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN alpha-2b enhanced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> activity of monocytes against A375 cells which showed low sensitivity to the direct growth inhibitory effect of IFN alpha-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of NK cells from the monocyte preparations by anti-Leu-11b monoclonal antibody and complement did not affect the monocyte activation by IFN alpha-2b, indicating that NK cells were not involved in this system </plain></SENT>
