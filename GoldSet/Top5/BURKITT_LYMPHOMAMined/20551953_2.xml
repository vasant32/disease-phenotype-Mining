<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases or dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are a family of proteins that catalyse the inactivation of MAPK in eukaryotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known of the expression, regulation or function of the DUSPs in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used RT-PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine the expression of DUSP16 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation in the DUSP16 CpG island was analysed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing and methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activation of MAPK was determined using western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies for extra-cellular signal-related kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of cell lines was assessed using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of DUSP16, which inactivates MAPK, is subject to methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines and in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The silencing is associated with aberrant methylation in the CpG island in the 5' regulatory sequences of the gene blocking its constitutive expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, the CpG island of DUSP16 is unmethylated in other non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs) and epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, neither constitutive nor inducible ERK or p38 activity varied significantly with DUSP16 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, activation of JNK was increased in lines with DUSP16 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, methylation in the DUSP16 CpG island blocked transcriptional induction of DUSP16, thereby abrogating a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological negative feedback loop that limits JNK activity, and conferred increased cellular sensitivity to agents, such as sorbitol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> chemotherapeutic agents that activate JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DUSP16 is a new epigenetically regulated determinant of JNK activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
