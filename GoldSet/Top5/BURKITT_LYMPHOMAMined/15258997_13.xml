<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study has compared immunohistological marker expression profiles and genomic imbalances in seven African endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (eBLs) with those in ten European B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with MYC rearrangement as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>eBLs showed a typical histomorphology and a homogeneous immuno-profile: CD10+, CD38+, CD77+, bcl-2-, and IgM+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), only three out of six eBLs showed imbalances (median number of imbalances = 2), with gains on chromosome 17 in two eBLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> highly proliferating, with a Ki-67 index of at least 90%, and included seven with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (sBL) and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with MYC rearrangement (MYCre+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to eBL, the immuno-profiles of the European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were less homogeneous and inconsistent for CD10, CD38, CD77, IgM and bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five of seven sBLs, CGH showed a higher number of imbalances (median = 6), with recurrent gains on chromosome 1q (3/7) and losses on 12q and 17p (2/7), whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three MYCre+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e> had fewer imbalances (median = 4), with gains on 17q in two of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that eBL has a homogeneous immunohistology and few secondary genomic aberrations, whereas MYC-rearranged and highly proliferating European B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group that includes sBL and a subgroup of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
