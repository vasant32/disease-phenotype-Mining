<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most investigated resistance mechanisms is P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp)-mediated multiple drug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed P-gp using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody JSB1 in a series of 118 children with ALL, 103 at diagnosis and 15 at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased P-gp expression was found in 55 (53%) patients at diagnosis and in 11 (73%) at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the bone marrow aspirate slides for early response to treatment in a central review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between P-gp and early response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> had higher P-gp levels than the others, 5.3% versus 1.0% (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that P-gp-mediated multiple drug resistance is not a factor in a slow response to ALL induction therapy </plain></SENT>
