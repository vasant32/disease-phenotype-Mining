<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is classically considered to be associated with translocation (4;11)(q21;q23), and to have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report an extensive immunophenotypic, genomic and clinical study of a series of 64 preB-1 ALL patients, representing 6.3% of a cohort of consecutive ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The engagement of preB1-ALL cells in the B-lineage was confirmed by their B-lineage score, equal to or higher than 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than 90% of the cases tested showed rearranged IGH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Translocation (4;11) was the most frequent karyotypic anomaly seen, but only accounted for 24% of the preB1-ALL cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the myeloid associated antigen CD15 was also found with high incidence in this subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biological features at presentation showed more significant differences between preB1- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> than between preB1- and preB2-ALL (CD10+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, outcome characteristics of the 22 children with preB1-ALL confirmed the worse prognosis of this entity </plain></SENT>
