<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1995 to 2004, we diagnosed six pediatric patients with mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> using thoracentesis as the initial diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic results of the pleural fluid cells were consistent with mature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thoracentesis for the diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children is safe, fast, and accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It should be strongly considered as an initial diagnostic procedure for pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> who are suspected of having B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
