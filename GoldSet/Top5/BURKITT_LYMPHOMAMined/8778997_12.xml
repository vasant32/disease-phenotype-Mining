<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interactive spatial data analysis involves the use of software environments that permit the visualization, exploration and, perhaps, modelling of geographically-referenced data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such systems are of obvious value in epidemiological research, both of an environmental and geographical nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is an increasing number of such software environments available on a variety of platforms and operating systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper considers the use of the proprietary Geographical Information System, ARC/INFO, in a spatial analysis context, showing how the spatial analytic tools that may be added to it can be exploited by geographical epidemiologists; such tools include those for modelling possible raised incidence of disease around suspected sources of pollution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The paper also reviews the use of systems such as S-Plus and XLISP-STAT, statistical programming environments to which spatial analysis functions or libraries may be added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of INFO-MAP, a system designed to aid in the teaching of interactive spatial data analysis, is also highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The various software environments are illustrated with reference to examples concerned with: clustering of childhood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in part of Lancashire, England; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Uganda; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007107" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">larynx cancer</z:e> in Lancashire; and childhood mortality in Auckland, New Zealand </plain></SENT>
