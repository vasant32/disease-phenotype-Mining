<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment commencing 7 days after i.v. injection of Ramos cells, with 3 doses of an anti-CD19 immunotoxin (IT; BU12-SAPORIN) or an anti-CD38IT (OKT10-SAPORIN) led to a significant prolongation of survival compared with sham-treated controls; the anti-CD38 IT gave the greatest prolongation of survival, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated animals eventually succumbed to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When both ITs were used in combination at equivalent dose levels, the therapeutic outcome was significantly improved over that obtained for single IT therapy, with 20% of animals surviving disease-free to 300 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When anti-CD38 IT was given in combination with anti-CD19 antibody there was no therapeutic improvement over anti-CD38 IT used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when anti-CD19 IT was given in combination with CD38 antibody, a significant prolongation of survival ensued over that obtained with anti-CD19 IT alone, though this was not as significantly pronounced as that obtained when both ITs were used in combination and was only as good as the survival obtained with OKT10 antibody used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD19 and CD38 are expressed on the surface of the vast majority of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cells, and our findings provide a sound rationale for a combination immunotoxin trial in these diseases directed against both these target molecules </plain></SENT>
