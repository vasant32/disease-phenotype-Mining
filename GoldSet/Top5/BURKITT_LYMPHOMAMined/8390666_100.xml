<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that the EBNA-5 protein (alternatively designated EBNA-LP) that is required for B-cell transformation can form a molecular complex with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (RB) and p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using EBNA-5 deletion mutants, we have found that a 66-amino acid-long <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, encoded by the W repeat of the EBV genome, is sufficient for binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Point mutations of RB and p53 that inhibit their complexing with other DNA <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncoproteins do not affect their binding to EBNA-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p53 competes with RB for EBNA-5 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the mechanisms involved in EBV transformation may include impairment of RB and p53 function </plain></SENT>
