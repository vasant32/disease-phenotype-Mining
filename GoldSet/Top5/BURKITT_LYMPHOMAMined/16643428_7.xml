<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fusions result in either chimeric proteins or activation of the partner gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are a few examples of abnormalities resulting in truncated and, most likely, unproductive ETV6 proteins, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of ETV6 and/or the partner is leukaemogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a novel ETV6 rearrangement, identified in a paediatric pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and molecular genetic analyses revealed a fusion of ETV6 and BAZ2A (at 12q13), generated through a cryptic rearrangement between 12p13 and 12q13, consisting of exons 1 and 2 of ETV6 and a sequence from intron 1 of BAZ2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein, but may encode a truncated form of ETV6, containing the first 54 amino acids (aa), followed by 16 aa from the 3' fusion sequence, reminiscent of ETV6 fusions with MDS2, LOC115548, PER1, and STL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement might also modify the regulation of BAZ2A by either activating a cryptic promoter or by coming under the control of the ETV6 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present case emphasises that 'unproductive' ETV6 rearrangements may play an important pathogenetic role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
