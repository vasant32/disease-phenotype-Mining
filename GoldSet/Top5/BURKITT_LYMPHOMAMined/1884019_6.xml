<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that an Tf-independent iron uptake system is physiologically important for maintaining the growth of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data show that Raji cells take up iron from iron salts using a relatively high-capacity, low-affinity, temperature- and calcium-dependent uptake system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apparent capacity of this system increases when: (1) cells are cultured in Tf-free medium containing high concentrations of iron salt as opposed to medium containing Tf; and (2) when the iron salt concentration of Tf-free medium is lowered to about 1.6 mumol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular iron uptake also increases when a maximum number of cells are in S and G2 and M cell phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells are sensitive to growth inhibition by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This evidence supports the hypothesis that certain malignant lymphocytes, under iron deplete conditions, fulfill an iron requirement for proliferation by an adaptation such as Tf-independent iron uptake </plain></SENT>
