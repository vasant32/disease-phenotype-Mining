<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 50 clusters involving cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> investigated in the United States in 1961-1977, eight showed suggestive evidence of underlying infectious causation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven of the eight communities, case occurrence was associated with the attendance of patients or their siblings at particular schools or with family participation in particular church groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five, rapid population growth had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other findings included the possible association of cases with unusual patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> (rheumatic illness in one community, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008049" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chickenpox</z:e> in another) and with other childhood diseases, including other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one community, two cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> occurred at the same time, and a third case arose 3 years later in boys living in a newly developing neighborhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such community observations support the need for continued biologic research regarding the possible role of infectious agents in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
