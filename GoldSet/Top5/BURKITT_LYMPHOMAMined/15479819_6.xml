<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that R induces expression of the cellular C-mer gene in a variety of cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-mer expression was detected in lymphoblastoid cells immortalized with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBV but not in lymphoblastoid cells immortalized with an EBV that had BRLF1 deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Oral hairy leukoplakia</z:e> tongue tissue, which contains the lytic form of EBV replication, also has enhanced C-mer expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C-mer is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by the ligand Gas6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-mer is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic debris by monocytes/macrophages and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial cells and is capable of producing an antiapoptotic signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modulation of the C-mer signal transduction cascade by a variety of different approaches did not alter the ability of R to induce lytic EBV gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, C-mer activation may be important for some other aspect of lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
