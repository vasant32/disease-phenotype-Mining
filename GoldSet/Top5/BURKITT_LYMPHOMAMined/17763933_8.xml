<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A gene of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BamHI-C fragment rightward reading frame 1 (BCRF1), codes <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> interleukin-10 (vIL-10), which is a close homolog to human IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV strain variations are known at EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and the distinct forms of LMP1 have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to further elucidate the variations of EBV strains, the BCRF1 (vIL-10) gene was analyzed using PCR-direct sequencing in African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines Raji, P3HR-1, EB1 and Daudi, Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line Akata, lymphoblastoid cell line OB and 22 wild EBV isolates from eight gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and 14 throat washes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found only five variations of the vIL-10 gene in them with one silent mutation and three non-silent mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji had no mutation to the prototype gene of B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EB1 and P3HR-1 had non-silent mutations in the sequences leading to the arginine/serine and threonine/proline interchanges at residues 4 and 166, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The silent mutation was detected at valine 102 in Daudi and also in the Japanese cell lines Akata, OB and 20 (90.9%) of the wild EBV isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The type of variations in the vIL-10 gene had a common relationship with those in the LMP1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the variants of valine 102 had China1-type LMP1 sequences except for Daudi with Med-type LMP1 and other minorities with B95-8 type LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The conservativeness of vIL-10 with a few variations suggests the indispensability of the vIL-10 gene in EBV and that the variations of the vIL-10 gene may depend upon the geographical prevalence of the EBV strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first report regarding the variations of the vIL-10 gene in cell lines and other wild isolates </plain></SENT>
