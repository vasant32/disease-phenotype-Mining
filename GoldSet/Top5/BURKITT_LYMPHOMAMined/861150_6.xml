<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the 6-year period was 1-87 X 10(-5), similar to that in the adjacent West Nile district </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrary to findings in other areas of Uganda, there was no evidence of seasonal variation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cases, nor of space-time clustering, nor of a decline in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship was noted between the median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and the incidence of the disease in different areas of Uganda, a finding consistent with intense malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> being a precipitating factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variable observations with respect to space-time clustering of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and seasonal variation in incidence in different areas remains unexplained, but it is suggested that a closer study of the patterns of malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in these areas may help to account for the findings </plain></SENT>
