<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether expression of PTEN is involved in MDM2-mediated chemoresistance, we examined a set of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell lines for the expression of PTEN and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Testing 9 ALL cell lines selected for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 phenotype and uniformly high levels of MDM2 expression, we initially demonstrated that cell lines with high levels of PTEN expression were sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, whereas lines lacking PTEN expression were generally resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of PTEN in a PTEN-negative and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-resistant ALL line (EU-1) resulted in decreased cell growth and enhanced sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examining the cellular localization of MDM2, we confirmed that the majority of MDM2 is localized in the nucleus in PTEN-negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-sensitive ALL cells, whereas MDM2 is expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm in either PTEN-positive or PTEN-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by coimmunoprecipitaton and cotransfection assays, we found that PTEN physically binds p53 in vitro as well as in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of PTEN to p53 attenuated MDM2-mediated p53 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PTEN inhibits MDM2 and protects p53 through both p13k/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, loss of PTEN can result in resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by activating MDM2-mediated antiapoptotic mechanism </plain></SENT>
