<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the role of TGF-beta signaling molecules in response to TGF-beta1-mediated cell growth inhibition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and EBV reactivation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we confirmed the effect of TGF-beta1 on the cell growth and EBV reactivation in six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta1 induced cell growth inhibition and EBV reactivation in these cell lines but did not in Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of TGF-beta1 unresponsiveness in Akata cells, we studied the expression of TGF-beta receptors and the intracellular signaling molecules Smads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines expressed TGF-beta type I receptor, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta type II receptor (R-II) was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines except Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the TGF-beta R-II into Akata cells results in sensitivity to TGF-beta1-mediated growth inhibition, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, to test a possibility to the transcriptional repression of the TGF-beta R-II gene in Akata cells, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylation (HDAC) inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of TGF-beta R-II in Akata cells was induced by TSA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the lack of functional TGF-beta R-II impedes the progression of signals through TGF-beta1 and becomes a determinant of unresponsiveness to TGF-beta1-mediated growth inhibition and EBV reactivation </plain></SENT>
