<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study a replica cDNA screening (RCS) approach to identify genes differentially expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002895'>papillary thyroid carcinomas</z:hpo> (PTC) was used, as compared to non-neoplastic thyroid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RCS is based on hybridization of radioactively labeled cDNA probes made from the biopsies to replica membranes with 15 000 clones from a PTC cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the genes overexpressed in PTC, and especially in clinically aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with histologic evidence of poorly differentiated or undifferentiated areas, a novel gene named NATH was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NATH has two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species, 4.6 and 5.8 kb, both harboring the same open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 866 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NATH protein is homologous to yeast N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1 and to mouse NARG1 (mNAT1) and contains four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, suggesting that NATH may be part of a multiprotein complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overlapping RT-PCR fragments from several PTC biopsies confirmed the NATH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Northern blots, semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments, TaqMan real-time RT-PCR experiments, and in situ hybridization verified the overexpression of NATH <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> localized to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in PTC biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NATH was expressed at a low level in most human adult tissues, including the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thyroid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased NATH expression was seen especially in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and in adult human testis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recombinant in vitro expression showed that NATH protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm, and was present as a single protein band of the expected 105 kDa molecular weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Heterologous expression of NATH in the papillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line (NPA) and 293 cells did not alter the cellular proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The biological function of NATH remains to be elucidated, but the overexpression in classic PTC and especially in poorly differentiated or undifferentiated components may indicate a function in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002895'>papillary thyroid carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
