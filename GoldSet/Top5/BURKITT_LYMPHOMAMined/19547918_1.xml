<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiolabelled immunotherapy agents have an increasingly significant role in autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) by improving the tolerability and increasing the efficacy of the conditioning regimen, thereby reducing the relapse risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-ibritumomab) combined with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (Bu/Cy/E) followed by ASCT in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each patient received a single dose of (90)Y-ibritumomab (0.4 mCi/kg on day -14) with Bu/Cy/E as a conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient cohort consisted of 19 individuals (ten males), of median age 51 years (range, 25-63 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had received two or more chemotherapy regimens before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologies were diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), follicular (n = 2), mantle cell (n = 2), and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 10 days and time to platelet engraftment was 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were evaluable for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The objective overall response rate was 84.2% (16/19): continued CR, 36.8% (7/19); induced CR, 36.8% (7/19); and PR, 10.5% (2/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 29.4 months (13.4-36.6), the estimated 3-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 52.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 45.8-59.4) and 26.3% (95% CI 19.8-32.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were similar to those seen historically with Bu/Cy/E alone, and there were no treatment related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, (90)Y-ibritumomab with Bu/Cy/E and ASCT is feasible in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL, without increased toxicity </plain></SENT>
