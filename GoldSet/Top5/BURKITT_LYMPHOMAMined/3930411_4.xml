<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously described an MAb referred to as 38.13 which reacts with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> membrane antigen (named BLA) on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BLA antigen and other B-cell differentiation markers have been studied on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines treated with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, agents from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51307">diester</z:chebi> series (with or without differentiating properties) and teleocidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differentiation inducers tested, expression of BLA as well as of surface IgM decreased on the induced cells whereas that of BI increased and that of HLA DR remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells studied reacted with anti-IgD, with B2 or with LBI MAbs, either before or after induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An EBV-negative line (BJAB) was compared to its Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-converted subline (BJAB/B95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both EBV-positive and EBV-negative lines gave comparable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells could be moved along their differentiation pathway by chemical inducers and suggest that BLA represents a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> marker of early B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
