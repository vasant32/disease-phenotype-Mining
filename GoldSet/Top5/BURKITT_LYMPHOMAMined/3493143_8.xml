<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-MTX), the primary plasma metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) in humans, was assessed by inhibition of colony formation in agar, using human bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage stem cells (CFU) from healthy volunteers and RAJI cells, a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a 2 hr exposure of cells to 7-OH-MTX, the concentrations necessary to produce a 50% inhibition of colony formation were 180 microM and 10 microM for bone marrow cells and for RAJI cells respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A continuous incubation with 20 microM folinic acid (CF) protected the RAJI cells from 7-OH-MTX cytotoxicity at concentrations below 5 microM but was not able to completely reverse 7-OH-MTX effects at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous incubation of 7-OH-MTX-preloaded cells (2 hr, ID90) with the end products of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-dependent reactions, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (100 microM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (10 microM), completely rescued RAJI cells from the 7-OH-MTX cytotoxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> alone had no effect on the 7-OH-MTX response curve, both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> alone or CF-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> combination produced 75% and 90% protection respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CF and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> concentrations necessary to achieve 90% protection were 20 and 100 microM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that 7-OH-MTX can exhibit a cytotoxic selectivity for this human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line as compared to human bone marrow stem cells and the cytotoxicity of 7-OH-MTX cannot be reversed by CF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that 7-OH-MTX and/or its polyglutamylated derivatives may play an important role on different enzyme(s) involved in the interconversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> cofactors necessary for the de novo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
