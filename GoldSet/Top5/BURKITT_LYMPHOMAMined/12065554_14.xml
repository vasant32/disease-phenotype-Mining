<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1987 to February 2001, 60 children, median age 9 years (range, 2.1 to 17 years), with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were enrolled onto two sequential institutional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1987 to 1992, 30 patients were stratified according to the absence (regimen IA, n = 19) or presence (regimen IB, n = 11) of bone marrow (BM) or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5-week cytoreductive chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, high-dose (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX), and intrathecal MTX or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> were provided as a 4-day continuous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regimen IB was intensified by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> ifosfamide and escalating MTX doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 1992, regardless of BM or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> status, 30 patients have been placed on regimen II, which is identical to IB but without ifosfamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scheduled duration of regimen II was 45 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EFS and disease-free survival at 5 years are 81% +/- 5% and 87% +/- 5%, respectively, for 59 assessable patients (73% +/- 8% and 85% +/- 7% for regimen IA + IB, 89% +/- 6%, EFS and disease-free survival, for regimen II; median follow-up, 6.7 years; range, 0.6 to 13.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients, two of whom were receiving regimen II, died as a result of initial treatment failure or relapse, and five patients, none receiving regimen II, died as a result of treatment-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This 45-day intensive chemotherapy program is the shortest schedule for disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and overcomes previously recognized risk factors such as BM and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> infiltration </plain></SENT>
