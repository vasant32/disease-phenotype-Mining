<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain additional diagnostically helpful criteria, cytophotometric analysis of the DNA content was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>117 specimens of NHL were examined, including 51 cases of low grade NHL (14 centroblastic-centrocytic, 9 centrocytic, 14 lymphoplasmocytoid immnocytomas and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Iymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>) and 66 cases of high grade NHL (15 centroblastic, 18 immunoblastic, 7 Burkitt and 26 lymphoblastic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The smears were stained with Feulgen and were evaluated by image analysis (CAS 200, Becton- Dickinson) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5 c exceeding rate differed significantly (p = 0.0081) between low- and hig-grade NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of low grade NHL, clearly aneuploid cases were not found (Auer type I 32%, type II 62%, type III 6% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high grade NHL's showed histograms Auer type II (10% of cases), type III (62% of cases) as well as clearly aneuploid type IV (28% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, image cytophotometry can be used along side <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> to differentiate between low and high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in morphologically difficult cases </plain></SENT>
