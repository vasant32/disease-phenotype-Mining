<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment began with a prephase (low-dose steroids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>), except in patients with low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A (resected stage I and abdominal stage II disease) received three courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B (not eligible for groups A or C) received five courses of chemotherapy comprising high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> and intrathecal (IT) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group C (patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and/or bone marrow involvement with &lt; 30% of blast cells) received eight courses containing intensified high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and triple IT injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 2 year event-free survival and overall survival rates for the 72 patients were 65% and 70%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; or = 33 years and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase value were associated with a shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No response to COP was also associated with a poor outcome in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced-stage Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including those with bone marrow and/or central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, can be cured with a short-term intensive chemotherapy regime tailored to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden </plain></SENT>
