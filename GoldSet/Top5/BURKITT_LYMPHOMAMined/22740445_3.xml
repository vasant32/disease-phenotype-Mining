<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GCs are polarized into dark (DZ) and light zones (LZ), a distinction that is of key importance to GC selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the difference between the B cells in each of these zones in humans remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that, as in mice, CXCR4 and CD83 can be used to distinguish human LZ and DZ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using these markers, we show that LZ and DZ cells in mice and humans differ only in the expression of characteristic "activation" and "proliferation" programs, suggesting that these populations represent alternating states of a single-cell type rather than distinct differentiation stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, LZ/DZ transcriptional profiling shows that, with the exception of "molecular" Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> closely resemble LZ cells, which has important implications for our understanding of the molecular programs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
