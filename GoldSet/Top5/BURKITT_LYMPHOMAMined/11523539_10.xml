<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has classically been associated with two pathologies with frequencies approaching 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of these, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), is of B-cell origin and the other, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of poorly differentiated epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, EBV had been identified with frequencies from a few percent to 100% (in one case) with a variety of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>; where in the west, the frequency of association is about 50%), sino-nasal T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334254" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoepitheliomas</z:e>, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from the head and neck, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since EBV is ubiquitous, with the vast majority of the world's population having met and seroconverted to the virus, the diversity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with which it has now been associated represents a substantial health burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a recent IARC monograph, EBV was classified as a group 1 carcinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, the data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC, as they relate to geographical restrictions, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> strain variation, co-factors in disease, and genetic components are reexamined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We raise the question whether in their origins, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> genuinely reflect distinct and independent events, as deemed at present, or may represent a response by different cell types to common extracellular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, a situation in Kenya apparently existed in the past, where both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and NPC were observed in ethnic Africans with roughly equal frequencies; more recently, in Kenya, EBV has been identified in nearly 100% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also consider <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> where the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> association is reportedly of low frequency, and offer explanations for these data, including the possibility of loss of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome once <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> has been initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If this phenomenon occurs as a frequent secondary event, EBV could be an even greater health risk than presently believed </plain></SENT>
