<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used immunohistochemical stains, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>), and gene rearrangement studies to identify the immunophenotype and the presence or absence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were men ranging in age from 27 to 65 years (mean age, 38.6 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy lungs of 21 age-matched controls were examined for EBV using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>; these included 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> who did not have pulmonary lesions and 12 HIV-negative individuals who died accidentally (mean age, 38.6 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 11 pulmonary lesions showed the gross and microscopic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>, with zonal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and prominent angioinvasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nodules consisted of a mixture of atypical large lymphocytes, with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli and with a background of small and intermediate-size lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The large lymphocytes were CD20 positive, consistent with a B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 11 cases demonstrated EBV1-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and CD20 positivity in the large, atypical lymphocytes by double labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient showed EBV positivity in CD20-negative, CD45RO-positive large cells, but these cells were CD3 negative and showed a monoclonal heavy chain gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction, indicating that these were of B-cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aberrant CD43 coexpression was identified in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EBV latent membrane protein was demonstrated in 9 of 11 cases by immunohistochemical stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lungs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 21 control patients were negative for EBV by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in our series, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> is a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> and that it has a strong association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
