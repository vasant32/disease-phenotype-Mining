<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The putative oncogene bcl-2 is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation typical of human follicular B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bcl-2 gene product is not altered by the translocation, but its expression is deregulated, presumably by the Igh enhancer E mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Constitutive bcl-2 expression seems to augment cell survival, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with a bcl-2 retrovirus enables certain growth factor-dependent mouse cell lines to maintain viability when deprived of factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high levels of the bcl-2 product can protect human B and T lymphoblasts under stress and thereby confer a growth advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice expressing a bcl-2 transgene controlled by the Igh enhancer accumulate small non-cycling B cells which survive unusually well in vitro but do not show a propensity for spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, an analogous myc transgene, designed to mimic the myc-Igh translocation product typical of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and rodent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, promotes B lymphoid cell proliferation and predisposes mice to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in pre-B and B lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous experiments have suggested that bcl-2 can cooperate with deregulated myc to improve in vitro growth of pre-B and B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a marked synergy between bcl-2 and myc in doubly transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>E mu-bcl-2/myc mice show hyperproliferation of pre-B and B cells and develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> much faster than E mu-myc mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suprisingly, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> derive from a cell with the hallmarks of a primitive haemopoietic cell, perhaps a lymphoid-committed stem cell </plain></SENT>
