<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> produce protein-associated DNA breaks in numerous cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in vitro exposure to Adriamycin (0.1-50.0 micrograms/ml) resulted in no detectable DNA cleavage in lymphocytes from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) or in either B- or T-lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DNA cleavage was observed in T-cells from CLL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2687">amsacrine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> caused at least 50-fold less DNA cleavage in CLL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes as compared to L1210 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings cannot be accounted for by differences in drug uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to explain the relative resistance of human lymphocytes to drug-induced DNA cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA topoisomerase II, an intracellular target of tested drugs, was assayed in CLL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood lymphocytes by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enzyme was detected neither in unfractionated lymphocytes nor in the enriched B- and T-cells from 28 untreated patients with CLL (Stage 0-IV) and from seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exponentially growing L1210 cells had approximately 7 x 10(5) enzyme copies per cell, suggesting a 100-fold higher content than that of CLL or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were, however, detectable levels of DNA topoisomerase II in cells obtained from patients with diffuse histiocytic, nodular poorly differentiated and nodular mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and CLL with prolymphocytic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DNA topoisomerase I, a potential target for anticancer chemotherapy, was detectable in CLL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, as well as in cells of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The above results may offer an explanation for the ineffectiveness of Adriamycin in the treatment of CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It could be suggested that low levels of DNA topoisomerase II contribute to drug resistance operating in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with a large compartment of nonproliferating cells </plain></SENT>
