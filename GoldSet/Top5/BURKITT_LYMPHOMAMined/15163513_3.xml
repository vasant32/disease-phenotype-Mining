<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, an in vivo excision and amplification system in human BJAB cells was devised by combining the Cre/loxP system of bacteriophage P1 and the large T antigen/SV40 ori system of Simian virus 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two loxP sequences, each of which serves as a recognition site for recombinase Cre, were integrated unidirectionally into 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the human iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An SV40 ori sequence, which serves as a conditional replication system, was inserted between the loxP sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trans-acting genes cre and large T antigen, which were under the control of a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> responsive promoter, were also inserted into the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of the iNOS, respectively, by homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon induction by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi>, the 45-kb iNOS genomic fragment of human chromosome 17 flanked by two loxP sites was excised and amplified up to about 45 copies per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our method is very useful for obtaining large genomic fragments in quantities directly from human cells without using foreign hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our approach can be used effectively for gap sequencing of a genome, gene therapy, and functional analysis of unknown genes in human cells </plain></SENT>
