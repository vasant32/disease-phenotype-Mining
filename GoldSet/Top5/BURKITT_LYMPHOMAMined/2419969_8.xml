<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BL13, a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody raised against human B cells, blocked the function of the C3d receptor (CR2) and bound with high affinity (5 X 10(8) L M-1) to CR2 on B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following capping with the second antibody, BL13 inhibited C3d-dependent rosette formation of Daudi and Raji cells and C3b-dependent CR2-mediated rosette formation with B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, but did not inhibit CR1-mediated rosettes between C3b-bearing cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Competitive binding experiments between biotinylated BL13 or anti-CR2 antibody HB-5 and unlabelled antibodies demonstrated that BL13 bound to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> that is distinct from that recognized by HB-5, and closely associated with that recognized by monoclonal antibody anti-B2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BL13 only reacted with some B cells and follicular dendritic cells in germinal centres in human lymph nodes, whereas HB-5 strongly reacted with circulating B cells and bound to most cells in the follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of antigenically defined CR2 </plain></SENT>
