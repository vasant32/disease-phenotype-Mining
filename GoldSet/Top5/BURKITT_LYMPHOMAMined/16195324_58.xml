<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mTOR inhibitors (MTIs), a class of signal transduction inhibitors, would be effective in primary human ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblasts from adult patients with precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> were cultured on bone marrow stroma and were treated with CCI-779, a second generation MTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated cells showed a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptotic cells, compared to untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the effect of CCI-779 in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We treated a total of 68 mice generated from the same patient samples with CCI-779 after establishment of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with CCI-779 showed a decrease in peripheral-blood blasts and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In dramatic contrast, untreated animals continued to show expansion of human ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We performed immunoblots to validate the inhibition of the mTOR signaling intermediate phospho-S6 in human ALL, finding down-regulation of this target in xenografted human ALL exposed to CCI-779 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MTIs can inhibit the growth of adult human ALL and deserve close examination as therapeutic agents against a disease that is often not curable with current therapy </plain></SENT>
