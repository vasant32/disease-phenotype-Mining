<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji harbors multiple copies of latent Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once per cell cycle the origin of plasmid replication of Epstein-Barr virus provides replication function in cis for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we examined in vivo nucleoprotein complexes on the initiator element of the origin before and after DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this purpose Raji cells were synchronously growth arrested in G1 phase by mimosine and in mitosis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of the initiator element with proteins was visualized by footprinting with dimethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> and ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation patterns indicated a novel binding activity within each element of a nonamer repeated three times at the initiator element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activity was strongly diminished in mitotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5'-ends of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were mapped to the nonamers by ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction, suggesting potential initiation sites for replication from DS </plain></SENT>
