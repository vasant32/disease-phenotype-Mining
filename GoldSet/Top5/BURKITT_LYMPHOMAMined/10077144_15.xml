<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (endemic) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) was initiated on fine-needle-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsies from 46 proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases in Malawi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene expression that might correlate with patient serology (where high levels of antibodies to lytically related genes are commonly observed) was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two-thirds of the cases, we identified the EBV BZLF1 replication activator intermediate early protein ZEBRA in varying quantities and to varying extents in cells by immuno-cytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The early lytic-cycle gene transcript BHLF1 was assessed positively by solid-phase hybridisation in over half of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence of transcription of these genes was confirmed on a smaller number of surgically removed fresh biopsies by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We asked whether our findings, which are generally counter to the established notion that EBV gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> is restricted to the latent function, EBNA1, might offer some explanation for the differential responses to chemotherapy observed among African patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Where the duration of follow-up was sufficient to assign the cases (37 in number) to one of 3 categories, namely, complete, partial or no response, a significant correlation between expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> function ZEBRA and a positive patient response to treatment was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of this was associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and EBV gene expression results support the postulate of subgroups of African <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, the intermediate early antigen providing a marker of potential use in patient management </plain></SENT>
