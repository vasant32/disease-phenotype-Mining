<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies have shown that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and LCL cells are relatively resistant to fresh NK cells but are more susceptible to in vitro-activated NK cells; individual pairs differ as to whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> or LCL cells are more sensitive to such effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With most cell pairs studied, the two cell types were equally efficient at inducing NK-cell activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the in vitro stimulation protocol was changed to favour the induction of allo-specific responses, most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells were noticeably poorer stimulators than the corresponding LCL although both cell types induced a similar pattern of cytotoxicity; this appeared to be directed against HLA class I allo-antigens and could be inhibited by class I antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> target lines, though susceptible to this allo-specific lysis, were significantly less so than the corresponding LCL However, only 1/7 BL-cell lines tested vis-Ã -vis the LCL gave evidence of a gross reduction in HLA antigen expression and this was immediately apparent from both serological typing and cellular analysis </plain></SENT>
