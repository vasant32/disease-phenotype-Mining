<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An analysis and description of the anatomical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> distribution based on post-mortem examinations was made, highlighting lack of correlation between clinical staging and pathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A consistent observation was the high incidence of involvement of the kidney, liver, and heart in each of the stages (I-III).The data to be presented will clarify at least in part, the unpredictability of response of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients to chemotherapeutic agents, because total cell-kill, needed for cure and/or prevention of relapse, is made almost impossible due to the widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume carried by the patients.Effective supportive treatment might be a life-saving adjuvant regimen in treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, where the organs so commonly involved might fail to function </plain></SENT>
