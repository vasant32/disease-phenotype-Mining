<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we established an in vitro system representing the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-type Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> which is characterized by expression of EBV-determined nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) and absence of EBNA-2 and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-negative cell clones isolated from the EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Akata were infected with an EBV recombinant carrying a selectable marker, and the following selection culture easily yielded EBV-infected clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-reinfected clones showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-type EBV expression and restored the capacity for growth on soft agar and tumorigenicity in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice that were originally retained in parental EBV-positive Akata cells and lost in EBV-negative subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was found that EBV-positive cells were more resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> than were EBV-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-infected cells expressed the bcl-2 protein, through which cells might become resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, at a higher level than did uninfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> confers <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance even in the absence of expression of LMP1 and BHRF1, both of which are known to have an antiapoptotic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, transfection of the EBNA-1 gene into EBV-negative Akata clones could not restore malignant phenotypes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance, thus suggesting that EBNA-1 alone was not sufficient for conferring them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the persistence of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells is required for the cells to be more malignant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistant, which underlines the oncogenic role of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> genesis </plain></SENT>
