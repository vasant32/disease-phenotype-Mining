<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with seropositive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) have elevated titers of precipitating antibody toward an antigen designated RA nuclear antigen (RANA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-RANA reactivity has been associated with prior Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the protein blot technique, we have identified, in extracts of WI-L2, an EBV+ nonproducer B-lymphoblast line, a Mr 80,000 polypeptide that is reactive with anti-RANA-containing sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> can be recovered from RANA precipitin bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mr 80,000 polypeptide appears to be EBV-associated, as a homologous antigen was detected in two other EBV+ cell lines, Daudi and Raji, but was not present in three EBV- human cell lines tested, HeLa, BJAB, and Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-RANA antibodies and antibodies reactive with the Mr 80,000 polypeptide also appear coincidently in the sera of individuals exhibiting an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the RANA-associated Mr 80,000 polypeptide suggested its identity with the previously recognized EBV-associated nuclear antigen designated EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Mr 80,000 antigen shares with EBNA the properties of being a heat-stable, DNA binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBNA is traditionally assayed by a complement fixation reaction and anti-Mr 80,000 antibodies were shown to be reactive when a complement fixation assay was used in the immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, when the Mr 80,000 antigen was used to absorb an anti-RANA/anti-EBNA serum, both antibodies were reduced </plain></SENT>
