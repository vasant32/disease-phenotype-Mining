<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radioiodinated human beta-interferon-Ser 17 (Betaseron) was reversibly cross-linked to Daudi cells by dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The radioactive ligand was cross-linked to three macromolecules forming labeled complexes of apparent Mr values of 130,000, 220,000, and 320,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Betaseron, human alpha-interferon, human interleukin 2 but not recombinant human gamma-interferon competed with the labeled ligand for binding to these putative receptor(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte-produced gamma-interferon competed weakly with 125I-Betaseron for binding to Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Betaseron-receptor complex(es) was purified by passage through a wheat germ lectin column followed by chromatography on an anti-interferon immunosorbent column and semipreparative gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cross-linked ligand-receptor complex was shown to be highly purified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can be dissociated into the labeled Betaseron (Mr = 17,000) ligand and a receptor moiety which has an apparent molecular weight of 110,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chromatographic behavior of the ligand-receptor complex on wheat germ lectin column suggests that the receptor is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The described procedure yielded about 1 microgram of Betaseron receptor from 10(10) Daudi cells, estimated to contain a maximum of about 15 micrograms of the receptor </plain></SENT>
