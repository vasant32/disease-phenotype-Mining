<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of the antigens that serve as targets for these responses remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the experiments reported here was to determine if virus-replication-associated antigens might function as targets for T-cell immunity with the emphasis on EBV-induced early antigen (EA) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated T-cell populations directed against this group of antigens would theoretically be effective in controlling the production of new virus progeny </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> associated with the EA complex do, in fact, induce the proliferation of memory T-cells from EBV-infected individuals irrespective of their serological status to the EA complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> associated with the diffuse component of EA (EA-D) was notably effective in inducing a strong proliferative T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell lines established from EBV-infected individuals following continuous exposure to either p17 or p50 components of the EA complex over a 10- to 12-week period were composed primarily of CD4-positive T-cells, although CD8-positive cells also persisted for up to 9 weeks in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that components of the EA complex might function as important target antigens in the immunosurveillance of EBV-infected cells </plain></SENT>
