<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on the growth of CA46 cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were studied through Trypan blue exclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay, cell cycle, DNA fragmentation analysis and detection of TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on the expression of c-myc, bcl-2, mutant-type p53 and Fas protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was studied by flow cytometry (FCM) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> inhibited proliferation of CA46 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> showed G(0)/G(1) or G(2)/M phase increase and S phase decrease, 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> was confirmed by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-myc, bcl-2, mutant-type p53 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was decreased sharply in CA46 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, while Fas protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> is able to inhibit the proliferation of CA46 cells and induce the cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by down-regulating the expression of c-myc, bcl-2, mutant-type p53 and up-regulating the expression of Fas </plain></SENT>
