<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cyclin D1 gene can be transcriptionally activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> as a result of chromosomal rearrangements but is normally silent in B and T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By isolating cyclin D1-related cDNAs from a B-lymphoid cell line, we identified clones that contain the coding sequences of human cyclin D2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predicted 289 amino acid protein shares 63% identity with human cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although cyclin D2 transcripts were detected in many lymphoid cell lines, it was not ubiquitously expressed and there was no apparent correlation with cyclin D1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, two B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> lines, JVM-2 and Karpas 620, both of which have 11q13 translocations and express cyclin D1, contained markedly different amounts of cyclin D2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An obvious distinction between these cells is that the JVM-2 line, which expresses high levels of cyclin D2, was immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We subsequently found that cyclin D2 is consistently expressed in group III Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and in lymphoblastoid cell lines immortalized by EBV, but not in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, in which expression of the EBV genome is more restricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data imply that the D-type cyclins may have non-overlapping functions at specific stages of lymphocyte differentiation and that the expression of cyclin D2 may be influenced, directly or indirectly, by EBV </plain></SENT>
