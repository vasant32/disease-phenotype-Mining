<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the cell lines were found to bind and catabolize exogenous [3H]PAF in a time- and temperature-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PAF binding could also be demonstrated in isolated membrane fractions, which provides further evidence of the existence of true membrane receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myeloid cell lines contained numbers of receptors at least 10-fold higher than in lymphoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biosynthesis of PAF upon challenge by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 could be demonstrated in HL60 and U937 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymphoid cell lines were unable to produce PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> showed incorporation of the label into three main fractions: neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> and PAF, but the distribution of the label varied depending on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant incorporation into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> was observed in uninduced myeloid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A phospholipase A2 acting on 1-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25842">hexadecyl</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22610">arachidonoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16870">sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine</z:chebi> and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15351">acetyl-CoA</z:chebi>:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase were expressed in the HL60 cell line and showed variations in specific activity with granulocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these enzyme activities were not expressed in Daudi and Jurkat cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate (1) the occurrence of PAF binding and catabolism in both myeloid and lymphoid cell lines; (2) the restriction of PAF biosynthesis to myeloid cell lines, especially HL60 cells; (3) the occurrence of differentiation-elicited changes in the specific activities of the enzymes involved in PAF biosynthesis by the remodelling pathway; and (4) the central role played by the disposal of lyso-PAF, a product of the phospholipase A2 reaction, in PAF biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
