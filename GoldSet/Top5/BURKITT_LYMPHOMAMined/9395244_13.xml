<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (Rb) protein, immunopurified from an extract of recombinant baculovirus infected cells, stimulated 10-100-fold the activity of DNA polymerase alpha from calf thymus or human HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purified Rb protein is composed of two electrophoretically distinguishable forms, i.e., partially phosphorylated and under-phosphorylated forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of Rb protein by protein phosphatase 2A largely diminished its stimulatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a hyperphosphorylated Rb protein, obtained from insect cells overexpressing Rb protein, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 simultaneously, stimulated DNA polymerase alpha more strongly than the singly-expressed Rb protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the phosphorylation is crucial for the stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rb protein isolated from human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells also stimulated DNA polymerase alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Rb protein did not affect eukaryotic DNA primase or Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By immunoprecipitation using anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody, Rb protein in nuclear extract of Raji cells was co-precipitated with DNA polymerase alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that DNA polymerase alpha exists as a complex containing phosphorylated Rb protein in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA polymerase alpha specifically bound to a purified Rb protein-immobilized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rb protein also bound to DNA polymerase alpha trapped to anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> column, suggesting the direct association of these two proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a new function of phosphorylated Rb protein in the regulation of DNA replication </plain></SENT>
