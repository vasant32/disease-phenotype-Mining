<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 9-year-old boy presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and distention for three months accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and night sweat during the last month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An abdominal sonography and CT scan showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and an intrahepatic mass with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e> lymph node enlargement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, and pleural fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A peripheral blood smear showed a few blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> of the abdominal mass revealed very cellular aspirates consisting of diffusely scattered small monotonous round cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells had little cytoplasm, along with round nuclei that showed clear-cut nuclear membrane, coarse chromatin pattern, and multiple small prominent nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnoses considered were small round cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo> such as malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the small noncleaved cell type was most consistent with the results of several studies including immunohistochemical staining, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cells were positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and showed finely vacuolated basophilic cytoplasm in both the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, characteristic of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
