<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent finding of somatically mutated mu heavy chain transcripts in human peripheral blood (PB) B lymphocytes suggests that T-dependent B-cell memory might not be restricted to class-switched cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We provide here evidence that IgM-only PB B cells are likely to be the IgM-expressing counterpart of classical (IgM- IgD-) memory B cells in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As shown by molecular single cell analysis, most IgM-only cells carry mutated V region genes, like class-switched cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although both subsets represent populations of nonactivated, resting cells, they express higher levels of Ig <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than naive (IgM+ IgD+) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgM-only and class-switched cells are CD38- CD77-, and mostly CD23-, thus neither resembling germinal center nor naive B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because many IgM-expressing B cells located in secondary lymphoid tissues resemble IgM-only PB B cells in terms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, we propose that the human lymphoid system contains a large compartment of IgM-expressing memory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these cells seem to represent the nonmalignant counterparts of IgM-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> that were found to harbor somatically mutated V genes </plain></SENT>
