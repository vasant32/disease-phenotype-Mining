<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the A-MYB transcription factor plays central and specific role in the regulation of mature B cell proliferation and/or differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is highly expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and may participate in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the B cell lines studied, but not in T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular the best responder cell line was the Burkitt's cell line Namalwa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The activity of A-MYB in B and not T cells was observed when either an artificial construct or the c-MYC promoter was used as a reporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the functional domains responsible for DNA binding, transactivation, and negative regulation, previously characterized in a fibroblast context, were found to have similar activity in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region of A-MYB responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the N-terminal 218 amino acids containing the DNA binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the B, but not T, cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that this 110-kDa protein may be a functionally important B cell-specific co-activator of A-MYB </plain></SENT>
