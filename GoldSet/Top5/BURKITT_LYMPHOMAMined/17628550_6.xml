<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>cDNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that eight <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related genes, including CD20, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1, CXCR-3, provirus integration site for Moloney murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus-2, CD72, IL-8RB, C-Fgr, and CD8beta, were upregulated in the aged mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that the lungs of the aged mice contained increased numbers of CD4 cells, CD8 cells, B cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a pro-inflammatory shift occurs in the lungs of mice with aging </plain></SENT>
