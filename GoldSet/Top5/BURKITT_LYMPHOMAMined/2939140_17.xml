<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of interferon (IFN) receptors was studied on freshly isolated human lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly enriched populations of small resting T lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were found to constitutively express high-affinity receptors for IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both types of lymphocytes also had lower-affinity IFN-alpha binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes had a mean of 230 IFN-alpha and 520 IFN-gamma high-affinity receptors per cell, whereas LGL had 520 IFN-alpha and 760 IFN-gamma receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, because LGL were larger than the T lymphocytes, the IFN receptor density was similar on the two types of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affinity of binding was similar on the two types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and on the cultured lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of IFN receptors per cell and the affinities of the IFN-receptor interactions varied little among the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the freshly isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and the cultured cell line Daudi had separate receptors for type I (alpha and beta) and type II (gamma) IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data indicate that two types of freshly isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes constitutively express IFN receptors that are similar to those present on the lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi derived from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
