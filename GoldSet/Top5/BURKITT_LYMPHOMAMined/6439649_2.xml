<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a chromosome translocation t(2;13) (p11-12;p11) involving the kappa (kappa) light chain gene region (2p11-12), and a subsequent translocation t(11;22) (q23;11) involving the lambda (lambda) light chain gene region (22q11) within the same clone, in a patient with B-cell prolymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (B-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53412">PLL</z:chebi>), of whose peripheral mononuclear cells 82% expressed (kappa) chains and 8% expressed (lambda) chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscope (EM) studies using the immunogold method showed that both kappa- and lambda-producing cells were prolymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene analysis by Southern blotting demonstrated rearrangement of both Ig heavy (H) chain genes and one kappa gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although a lambda gene rearrangement corresponding to the minor lambda-positive population was not detected, a small monoclonal (M) band of IgM-lambda was present in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosome translocations and the pattern of light chain expression, particularly the lambda-producing cells, are discussed in the light of the restricted light chain expression observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with variant translocations involving the light chain genes </plain></SENT>
