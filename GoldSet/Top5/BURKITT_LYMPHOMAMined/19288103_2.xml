<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our results using the LMB protocol on Korean adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients were treated with the LMB protocol; 29 males and nine females with a median age of 47 years (range 18-70) were analyzed, and 14 (36.8%) patients had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or bone marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the induction phase, 28 patients achieved complete response (CR, 73.7%) and five showed partial response (PR, 13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those achieving CR, only four showed relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the non-CR patients died, including five PR and one with progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other four patients died because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after the first course of induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The progression-free and overall estimated survival at 5 years was 74.99% and 68.10%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients who died, the median survival was 4.43 months (95% confidence interval 1.43-7.43 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred shortly after diagnosis, and four patients older than 58 years died after the first induction cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were caused by treatment-related morbidity and failure to achieve complete response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Jude/Murphy stage IV classification were significantly associated with poor overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the LMB protocol was effective for Korean adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, considering the high incidence of treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and the poor outcome of non-CR patients, risk-adapted modification of the induction phase is warranted </plain></SENT>
