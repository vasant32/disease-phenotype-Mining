<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of the neoplastic B cells occurring in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is an issue of controversial debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this matter, a semi-nested primer polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify the VDJ rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) gene of DNA extracts from 10 (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and 2 endemic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting amplificates were sequenced for comparison with known germ line VH segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control cases comprised six cases of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and six cases of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> known to display naive nonmutated, ie, pre-germinal center VH configurations; and eight cases of follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> known to display mutated VH genes with signs of a still-ongoing mutation reaction, characteristic for germinal center cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that derive therefrom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this approach revealed that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> express mutated VH genes with a mutation frequency considerably lower (4.9% and 5.4%, respectively) than that observed in follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, after subcloning the amplificates, sequence analysis revealed no signs of ongoing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results led us to conclude that the derivation of neoplastic B cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is definitely not from naive, nonmutated pre-germinal center B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, our findings support the view that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells stem either from early centroblasts that are arrested after an initial hypermutation reaction, or from germinal center B cells that have differentiated in terms of surface immunoglobulin profile and mutation pattern but not in terms of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and proliferation toward SIgM+ IgD- memory B cells because of the deregulated c-myc gene expression </plain></SENT>
