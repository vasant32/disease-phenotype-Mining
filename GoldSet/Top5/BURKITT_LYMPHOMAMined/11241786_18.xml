<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TCL1 is an oncogene activated by recurrent reciprocal translocations at chromosome segment 14q32.1 in the most common of the mature T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, T-cell prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It acts to transport Akt1 to the nucleus and enhance Akt1's serine-threonine kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TCL1 is also expressed in the B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, 14q32.1 breakpoints have not been detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and we therefore investigated in more detail how expression was activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No evidence for rearrangement near TCL1 was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, a NotI site adjacent to the TATA box in the TCL1 promoter was found to be unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines not expressing TCL1 were fully methylated at this NotI site, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> somatic cells were hemimethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that TCL1 was expressed in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) and the related disorder splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with villous lymphocytes (unlike in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mature B-cells), and that the NotI site was unmethylated on both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This correlation of repression and methylation was tested in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When cells with both alleles methylated at the NotI site were demethylated, TCL1 expression was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that in mature B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> there is an alternative mechanism of TCL1 activation that apparently involves loss of methylation of one promoter allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We discuss the significance of this for CLL <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and for genomewide hypomethylation in CLL </plain></SENT>
