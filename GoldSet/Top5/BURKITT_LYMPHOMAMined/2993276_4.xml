<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Raji cells, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus transcription and replication was delayed when compared to BHK cells, and the accumulation of plus and minus sense leader <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, full length plus and minus strand replicative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> accumulated in Raji cells to levels approximately equivalent to those in BHK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cell types, approximately four times as many minus strands as plus strands were detected late in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 16 h postinfection, 12% of the total genomic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesized in BHK cells was packaged and released whereas only 0.8% was released from Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, of those particles released by Raji cells, only 1% were infectious whereas 77% of those released by BHK cells were infectious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The virions released from both cell types contained similar amounts of the five <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> proteins, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of virions from Raji cells revealed a faster electrophoretic mobility of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> than the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in virions released from BHK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Raji cells may be restricted in their ability to support a complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at the level of virus assembly rather than at the level of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> replication </plain></SENT>
