<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both in vitro and in vivo the secreted form of alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is predominant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages in the development of a secretory IgA response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that preferential usage of the alpha s poly(A) site does not result from transcription termination and is independent of either the poly(A) sites or the 3' splice site associated with the exon encoding the membrane exon of IgA (alpha M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that a 349-bp region located 774 bp 3' to the alpha s poly(A) site is required for the preferential usage of the alpha s terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This region, which is the first isotype-specific cis-acting regulatory sequence not immediately adjacent to a secretory poly(A) site to be identified, contains regulatory elements that increase the efficiency of polyadenylation/cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A ubiquitous, approximately 58-kDa <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein interacts specifically with this regulatory region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies support the premise that cis-acting elements unique to each CH gene can impinge upon a common mechanism regulating Ig <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing </plain></SENT>
