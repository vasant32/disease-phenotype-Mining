<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding of [3H]leucine-labelled pure human interferon alpha from Namalwa cells to human FL and Daudi cells was studied, and evidence obtained to indicate receptor-mediated internalization of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell surface-bound and internalized interferons were quantified separately as trypsin-released and unreleased radioactivities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 37 degrees C, surface-bound interferon reached a maximum after 1 h and then decreased, while internalized interferon reached a maximum after 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 21 degrees C, in contrast, surface-bound interferon reached a maximum after 2 h and did not decrease thereafter; no internalization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same was true at 37 degrees C in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">NaF</z:chebi>, indicating dependence of internalization on temperature and energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control cultures at 37 degrees C, internalized interferon, after reaching a maximum, decreased after prolonged incubation, and concomitantly acid-soluble radioactivity appeared in the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in internalized interferon and the emergence of degraded interferon were inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fate of labelled interferon, bound to the cell surface of FL cells at 21 degrees C was studied at 37 degrees C, and the results indicated that trypsin-unreleased interferon was derived from the surface-bound interferon, and was secreted in part into the culture fluid in a degraded form upon prolonged incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relation of internalization of interferon to its biological activity was studied in three ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In FL cells, the antiviral activity was not induced when internalization of interferon was entirely blocked (at 21 degrees C or in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28741">NaF</z:chebi> at 37 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells, both 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase induction by interferon and internalization of interferon were inhibited completely by diethyldithiocarbamate (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="10101">DDC</z:chebi>), whereas in the case of FL cells, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="10101">DDC</z:chebi> inhibited neither 2-5A synthetase induction nor internalization of interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Raji cells, which have an interferon-specific binding site on the cell surface but are insensitive to interferon, were found not to internalize interferon, whereas other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, Daudi and Namalwa, which are sensitive to interferon, did internalize it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest (but do not prove) that internalization is required for the establishment of interferon activity </plain></SENT>
