<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This medium consisted of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and transferrin (TF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This serum-free medium containing albumin and transferrin is designated AT-IMDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipids</z:chebi> were not essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability remained high, greater than 80%, in the serum-free medium and the cells maintained their distinctive characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production capacity was maintained by the human T lymphoid cell lines JURKAT-77 and MO in short term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This simple medium composed of relatively inexpensive and readily available components should be useful for studies of lymphoid cell growth and differentiation and lymphoid cell products </plain></SENT>
