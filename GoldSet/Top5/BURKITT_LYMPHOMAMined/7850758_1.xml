<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we studied chromosome 8 abnormalities in 30 children with mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) or B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FISH was performed on metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei with a whole chromosome 8 painting probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were studied retrospectively after metaphases from the malignant cell specimen had already been G-banded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When interphase nuclei were examined, FISH was able to confirm t(8;14)(q24;q32) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients positive by previous G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH, however, was positive in metaphase spreads from only seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 15 patients were included in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six of them (40%), a translocation involving chromosome 8 was shown by a split small segment (8q24-8qter) on interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of metaphase spreads showed only three positive cases each by FISH or G-banding, respectively, with corresponding results in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By interphase FISH, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 8 also was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three patients shown by G-banding to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp>, interphase FISH study showed high scores of three chromosome 8 signal positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no cross-hybridization to other chromosomes interfering with FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis on interphase nuclei using a whole chromosome 8 hybridization probe will supplement and can be more sensitive than metaphase cytogenetic techniques for detection of chromosome 8 rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>/NHL </plain></SENT>
