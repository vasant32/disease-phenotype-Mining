<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous studies we described a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, whose cells recognized a molecule expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant breast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified this antigen by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis and Western blotting using the antibody produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigen so identified consisted of two clusters of spots with a molecular mass (Mr) of 60 and 50 kDa, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preparative immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was subsequently used to isolate the clusters of spots of higher molecular masses, from which <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragments of approximately 10 aa were separated on reverse-phase chromatography and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This procedure enabled the identification of the antigen recognized by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells as <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of serological analyses it was possible to identify the lower molecular mass cluster of spots as a molecule related to <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that this molecule is a membrane form of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 that differs from <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-60 in a COOH terminal portion </plain></SENT>
