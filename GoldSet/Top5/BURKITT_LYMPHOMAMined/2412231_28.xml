<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The carboxyl-terminal one-third of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) encoded by the BamHI restriction fragment K was synthesized in Escherichia coli by use of a high-expression plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resultant 28-kDa EBNA fusion <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi>, comprising 5-10% of the total soluble <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> protein, was purified to apparent homogeneity by phosphocellulose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi> column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both rabbit monospecific antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies against 28-kDa EBNA gave nuclear immunofluorescence staining on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and recognized the appropriate intact EBNA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> bands on immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ELISA with the purified 28-kDa EBNA as antigen was used to quantitate anti-EBNA antibody in human serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ELISA method was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than the classical anticomplement immunofluorescence assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-EBNA antibody was detected in sera from 100% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals who were seropositive for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen, and low anti-EBNA titers were detected in serum from most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The assay gave the expected pattern of titers in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, thus confirming the validity of this purified reagent for assessing EBNA antibody status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients had anti-EBNA titers as high as those seen in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these high-titer individuals, greater than 1% of the total IgG are antibodies that recognize 28-kDa EBNA, which indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain of EBNA is highly immunogenic </plain></SENT>
