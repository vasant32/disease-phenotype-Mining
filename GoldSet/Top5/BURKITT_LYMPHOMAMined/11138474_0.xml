<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific viruses are supposed to have etiological role in about 15% of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently the B-cell proliferation inducing effect of the hepatotropic and lymphotropic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-C virus (HCV) came into the limelight based on the high prevalence of HCV positivity in B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the authors was to establish the prevalence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paralelly the HBV, CMV and EBV markers, and the alterations of the humoral immune response (immunoglobulins, cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>42 patients (24 male, 18 female; the mean age: 54.1 years, range 22-80 years) classified as 16 indolent (low risk), and 25 aggressive (intermediate risk) NHL and one with very aggressive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, according to the modified REAL classification were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HBsAg and anti-HCV, HBsAg, anti EBV, anti CMV, furthermore polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HCV-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-HCV was found in 6/42 NHL patients (14.3%), while anti-HCV and/or HCV-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> PCR positivity revealed on overall HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 10/42 (23.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of them were HBsAg positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis, that HCV might have an aetiological role in the lymphoproliferation leading to B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
