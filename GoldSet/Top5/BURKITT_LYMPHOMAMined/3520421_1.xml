<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the results of two consecutive BFM-studies (BFM-NHL 75/81, n = 116; BFM 81/83, n = 95) a curative rate of 70% may be reached with an acceptable therapeutic toxicity (under 2% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the BFM-NHL-study 81/83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This result was already achieved in non-B-NHL in the study 75/81 by using an ALL therapy protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An improvement in the outcome of B-NHL was only achieved in the study 81/83 by introducing a new therapeutic concept including a combination of other agents and by reducing the duration of treatment to 8 weeks (stage I and II) and to 20 weeks (stage III and IV), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the non-B NHL, the prognosis of B-NHL distinctly varies according to the localized (I and II) and disseminated stage (III and IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of eventfree survival in the localized stage of B-NHL is excellent in both BFM-studies (86-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the disseminated stage of B-NHL the result is not satisfying so far (61% in the study 81/83 vs. 38% in the study 75/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relapse cascade in non-B NHL proceeds similar to ALL in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relapses have been observed within 5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence in B-NHL only occurs within the first year after diagnosis which justifies the reduction of treatment duration </plain></SENT>
