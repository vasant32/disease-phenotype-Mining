<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the methylation patterns of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the latent origin of DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus using automated fluorescent genomic sequencing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-modified DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that the minimal origin of DNA replication was unmethylated in 8 well-characterized human cell lines or clones carrying latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes as well as in a prototype virus producer marmoset cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that unmethylated DNA domains can function as initiation sites or zones of DNA replication in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5' from this unmethylated region we observed focal points of de novo DNA methylation in nonrandom positions in the majority of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and clones studied while the corresponding CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes carried by lymphoblastoid cell lines and marmoset cells were completely unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clustering of highly methylated CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> suggests that de novo methylation of unmethylated double-stranded episomal <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes starts at discrete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> sites in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first comparative high-resolution methylation analysis of a latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> origin of DNA replication in human cells </plain></SENT>
