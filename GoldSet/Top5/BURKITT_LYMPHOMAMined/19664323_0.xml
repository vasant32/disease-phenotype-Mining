<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It exists also in Africa, notably among largely Arab populations in North Africa, and in "hotspots" in East Africa among "native" Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article deals with the latter, as studied and defined in depth during the 1960s and 70s by the Irish-born surgeon, Peter Clifford </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through his published works, he has influenced and helped define the field of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> as it exists in Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He also did pioneering work on the African childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article is written as a tribute to Peter Clifford, focusing on his work on NPC, where he first defined the disease "hotspots" in the Kenyan Highlands, studied how best to treat the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in the absence of radiotherapy, looked at possible NPC predisposing factors in the Kenyan setting, and ultimately addressed how the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells interact with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peter Clifford's pioneering work was cut short by accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although outside East Africa he remains largely an 'unsung hero' in the field, his influence has been great </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It begs to be re-addressed and reconsidered </plain></SENT>
