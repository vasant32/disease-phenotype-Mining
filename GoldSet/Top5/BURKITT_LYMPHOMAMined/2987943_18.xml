<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Presented is a detailed molecular analysis of the rearranged c-myc oncogene from ABPC45, an unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> that was originally classified as translocation-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous data obtained by high-resolution chromosome banding suggested that this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was a member of a small group distinguished by the absence of rcpt (12;15) or (6;15) and further characterized by a band deletion near the c-myc locus on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, genomic Southern blotting and analysis of the cloned oncogene in the present study reveal that (i) chromosome 12 sequences lie 365 base pairs 5' of the rearranged c-myc; (ii) this DNA consists of immunoglobulin alpha switch region and 5' immunoglobulin mu switch region sequences that are rearranged in an aberrant fashion; and (iii) the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer element now resides approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs 5' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We infer from these and other data that the rearrangement of c-myc in ABPC45 occurred via a multistep switch region-mediated process and that a reciprocal translocation has indeed taken place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike many other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, this event did not interrupt the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc transcription unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rather, disruption of gene regulation is manifested in part by a change in relative usage of the two promoters normally used by the unrearranged gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to several of its counterparts in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, DNA sequence analysis of the translocated c-myc gene of ABPC45 reveals that it has not acquired point mutations in the noncoding first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results strongly imply that a cis-acting regulatory element normally located 5' of exon 1 is lost and that heavy-chain constant region or enhancer sequences exert similar cis effects on translocated c-myc loci </plain></SENT>
