<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Using the technique of recursive partitioning and amalgamation analysis with verification, the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (POG) investigated the independent prognostic significance of previously published prognostic factors significantly associated with event-free survival (EFS) in B-progenitor cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype (expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin [Ig] and of surface antigens CD10 and CD34), and DNA index (ratio of the flow cytometry-determined DNA content of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diploid cells) were the variables used in the evaluation of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolite</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimens in 1,535 children with the newly diagnosed B-progenitor cell ALL between February 1986 and May 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were three subgroups at widely different risks of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A DNA index greater than 1.16 was the most prognostic feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final prognostic subgrouping was as follows: (1) DNA index greater than 1.16; (2) DNA index less than or equal to 1.16, age less than 11.0 years, and leukocyte count less than 50 x 10(9)/L; and (3) DNA index less than or equal to 1.16, (age greater than 11.0 years, and/or leukocyte count greater than 50 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These groups made up 20%, 53%, and 27% of the patients and had 4-year EFS rates (SE) of 90.1% (6.3%), 80.5% (5.1%), and 50.4% (7.6%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the DNA index, leukocyte count, and age--data that are relatively inexpensive and simple to obtain--may be sufficient to stratify patients with B-progenitor cell ALL for risk-directed therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients at an extremely low risk of failing therapy (approximately 20% of cases in this study) can thus be identified and spared the toxic short-term and late effects of more intensive therapies that may be needed for children with less favorable clinical and biologic features </plain></SENT>
