<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> has been shown to promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, and our present study was focused on a possible cell cycle arrest and the pathways by which the apoptotic process is induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> may proceed along the intrinsic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>) or the extrinsic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor) pathway, which are mediated via different caspases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caspases are a class of homologous cysteine proteases recognized as pivotal mediators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> affects progression of the cell cycle or promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By incorporation of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> and [3H]valine, we showed that DNA, as well as protein synthesis, was reduced after incubation of Ramos cells with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> for 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We monitored cell cycle distribution by 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine staining and observed no cell cycle arrest in the <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>-incubated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of cells with <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> caused PS-flipping, as demonstrated by annexin V-binding (flow cytometry), and cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase measured by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we observed increased activity of caspase-3 and -9, but not of caspase-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9 reduced <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, inhibition of caspase-8 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> may promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via the intrinsic pathway in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the reduction in cell number can be explained by a direct apoptotic effect of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> rather than via cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
