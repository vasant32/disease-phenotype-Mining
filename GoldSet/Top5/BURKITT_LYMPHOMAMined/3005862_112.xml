<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro assay system that measures a complex of cellular responses to EBV-infected lymphocytes, we found that B cells from 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and from 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">AIDS-related disorders</z:e> produced abnormally low numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (P less than 0.001 as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) and that T-cell suppression, which was greater than 80 percent in EBV-seropositive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Instead, the patients' T cells markedly increased immunoglobulin production induced by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In further studies, we determined that the mean frequency of circulating EBV-infected B cells capable of spontaneous outgrowth in vitro was 13 per 10(6) B cells in 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and 21 per 10(6) B cells in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">AIDS-related disorders</z:e>--figures that were significantly higher than the mean in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">AIDS-related disorders</z:e> may be predisposed to the development of EBV-containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, because they have a profound defect of T-cell immunity to EBV and abnormally high numbers of EBV-infected B cells in the circulation </plain></SENT>
