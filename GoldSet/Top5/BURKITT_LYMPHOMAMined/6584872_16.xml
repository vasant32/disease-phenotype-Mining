<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method is described for directly hybridizing a small number of sorted chromosomes with specific DNA probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes are analyzed by flow cytometry and sorted by deflecting the droplets containing the desired chromosomes onto a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using probes specific for the human Y chromosome, it has been possible to unambiguously identify the peak corresponding to the Y chromosome in the flow karyotypes of a variety of male cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The position of this peak was found to vary significantly from individual to individual, correlating with the heterochromatin chromosomal polymorphism of the human Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the hybridization was such that, with a probe for a male-specific repetitive sequence, only 2,500 sorted chromosomes were enough to obtain a clear, positive signal; 10,000 were needed with a probe specific for a weakly repeated (maximum, 3-fold) sequence of Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this new method, chromosome sorting may be a rapid and efficient way to assign DNA sequences to chromosomes </plain></SENT>
