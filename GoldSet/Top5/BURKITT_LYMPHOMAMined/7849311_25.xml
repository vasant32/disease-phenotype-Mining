<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recurrent abnormalities of the short arm of chromosome 9, including translocations and interstitial deletions, have been reported in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathologic consequences of these abnormalities remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor (CDKN2) gene, which maps to 9p21, has been implicated by the finding of a high frequency of biallelic deletions in leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined the incidence of structural abnormalities affecting CDKN2 by DNA blot in a panel of 231 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 66 cell lines derived from patients with lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with defined cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural alterations of CDKN2 were seen in 20 (8.3%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fresh cases and 10 (15.1%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biallelic CDKN2 deletions were seen in 11 of 53 (21%) cases of B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association with any particular cytogenetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biallelic deletions were also found in high-grade and transformed non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) of both B- and T-cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases of transformed NHL, analysis of sequential samples showed loss of CDKN2 with transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither deletions nor rearrangements of the CDKN2 gene were seen in any of the 119 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> of mature B or T cells analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biallelic deletions of CDKN2 were observed in 6 of 13 NHL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of the 6 cases had undergone transformation from low- to high-grade disease: in 2 of these cases it was possible to show that the CDKN2 deletions were present in fresh material from the patient and were therefore not an artifact of in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of CDKN2 were seen in 2 cases (4%) of BCP-ALL, in 1 case of B-NHL, and in 1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and suggest the presence of a "hot spot" for recombination in the vicinity of the CDKN2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the loss of CDKN2 expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subset of BCP-ALL, some high-grade NHL, and in the transformation of NHL from low- to high-grade disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CDKN2 deletions and rearrangements occurred in the absence of detectable cytogenetic changes of chromosome 9p in 25 of 30 (83%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, of 10 cases of BCP-ALL that produced overt, transplantable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>), seven showed biallelic CDKN2 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of 11 cases that failed to engraft showed biallelic CDKN2 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>BCP-ALL cases that lack CDKN2 expression may have a particular propensity to grow in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
