<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Daudi) is highly susceptible to the cytotoxicity of verotoxin and contains large amounts of the verotoxin-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> on its surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mutant selected from Daudi cells for verotoxin resistance was found to be deficient in the verotoxin-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi>, globotriosylceramide and galabiosylceramide, and failed to bind verotoxin to its surface; interestingly, these mutant cells were found to be cross-resistant to inhibition of growth by alpha-interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant cells also lack the high affinity component of alpha-interferon binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that, in addition to providing the functional cell-surface receptor for verotoxin, these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> may also play a role in the modulation of the affinity of alpha-interferon for its membrane protein receptors </plain></SENT>
