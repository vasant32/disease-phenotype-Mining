<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We asked whether reactivation from latency of either virus requires de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, we measured the kinetics of expression of the lytic cycle activator genes and determined whether abundance of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> encoding these genes from either virus was reduced by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CHX blocked expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of EBV BZLF1 and BRLF1, the two EBV lytic cycle activator genes, when HH514-16 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, or a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHX also inhibited EBV lytic cycle activation in B95-8 marmoset lymphoblastoid cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV lytic cycle induction became resistant to CHX between 4 and 6 h after application of the inducing stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KSHV lytic cycle activation, as assessed by ORF50 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, was rapidly induced by the HDAC inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, in HH-B2 primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In HH-B2 cells, CHX did not inhibit, but enhanced, expression of the KSHV lytic cycle activator gene, ORF50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In BC-1, a primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line that is dually infected with EBV and KSHV, CHX blocked EBV BRLF1 lytic gene expression induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>; KSHV ORF50 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induced simultaneously in the same cells by the same inducing stimuli was resistant to CHX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experiments show, for the cell lines and inducing agents studied, that the EBV BZLF1 and BRLF1 genes do not behave with "immediate-early" kinetics upon reactivation from latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>KSHV ORF50 is a true "immediate-early" gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> induce lytic cycle gene expression of the two viruses differs and suggest that EBV but not KSHV requires one or more proteins to be newly synthesized between 4 and 6 h after application of an inducing stimulus </plain></SENT>
