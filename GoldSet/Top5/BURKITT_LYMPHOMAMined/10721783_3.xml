<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its incidence is rapidly increasing in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases of PBL were identified during a 16-year period among HIV negative patients in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of PBL in immunocompetent patients was stable at 1.03 per million per year </plain></SENT>
