<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only six (23%) were found positive which led to the hypothesis of a neutralizing factor in such salivas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The search for EBV-specific antibodies showed that NPC saliva contained neutralizing VCA and EA IgA (54 and 27% respectively) and VCA and EA IgG (73 AND 54% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both transforming and non-transforming throat washings contained virus particles as visualized by electron microscopy, but in non-transforming salivas (containing IgA and IgG) the particles were found to be clumped </plain></SENT>
