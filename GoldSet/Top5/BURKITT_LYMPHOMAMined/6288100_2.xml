<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pattern of protein synthesis has been compared in Namalwa cells following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these treatments cause a substantial increase in Sendai virus-induced interferon synthesis (up to 300-fold) we observed no comparable effect on the synthesis of other cellular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we have investigated the proteins synthesised before and 8 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1319860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sendai virus infection</z:e> of treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of the 300 most abundant cellular proteins were reproducibly affected, these always showed increased rates of synthesis in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most significant was a 3-4-fold enhancement in synthesis of a 35,000 molecular weight protein which we have called BEP35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On individual occasions treatment caused changes in the rates of synthesis of other proteins, these were not reproducible and involved less than 4% of the proteins investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the Sendai virus structural proteins or virus-induced cellular proteins were affected by the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and BrdUrd treatments have a relatively specific effect on the synthesis of interferon in Namalwa cells, as the majority of protein synthesis remains unaffected </plain></SENT>
