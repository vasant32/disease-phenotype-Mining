<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, the distal portion of chromosome 8 breaks off and is transposed, in most cases, to chromosome 14, known to carry the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In about 5% of the cases the same distal part of the chromosome 8 has moved to either chromosome 2 or 22, to the neighbourhood of the kappa or the lambda locus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MPC the distal region of chromosome 15 is transposed to the chromosome 12, known to carry the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, or enters into reciprocal exchange with the kappa locus-carrying chromosome 6 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several laboratories have located c-myc, the cellular homologue of the MC29 retroviral oncogene v-myc, to human chromosome 8 (refs 8-10) and mouse chromosome 15 (refs 11-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>- and MPC-associated translocations remove the c-myc gene from its original site and transpose it into or close to one of the immunoglobulin gene clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of the above findings we also looked for possible involvement of the c-myc gene in a B-cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> of a third species, the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> of spontaneous origin carry a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here we have localized the c-myc locus to chromosome 7 of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we have found that the c-myc gene was rearranged in four of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> carrying the characteristic chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
