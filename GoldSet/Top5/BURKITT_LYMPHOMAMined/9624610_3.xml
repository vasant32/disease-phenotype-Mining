<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of HHV-6 strain A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> on the expression of Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV-) encoded growth transformation-associated genes in two EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Akata and P3HR-3, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that HHV-6A upregulates the expression of the latent membrane protein LMP-1 in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBNA-2 was also upregulated in Akata cells following HHV-6A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection of reporter constructs carrying the LMP-1 regulatory sequences (LRS; -634/+40) or its 5' deleted derivatives in Akata and in a T-lymphoblastoid cell line, J-Jhan, confirmed the presence of positive and negative regulatory elements responsive to HHV-6A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in LMP-1 regulatory sequence (LRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of LRS constructs were under the influence of dominant negative factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HHV-6A was able to override the effect of such factors acting on reporter plasmids containing the -634/-54, -324/-54, -214/-54, and -106/-54 parts of LRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasmid that carried only the -54/+40 LRS region was constitutively active in both Akata and J-Jhan cells; in Akata, its activity was influenced by HHV-6A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that HHV-6A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may activate LMP-1 and EBNA-2 expression, which is essential for the immortalization of B-lymphocytes by EBV, shows a novel aspect of the interaction between these two herpesviruses </plain></SENT>
