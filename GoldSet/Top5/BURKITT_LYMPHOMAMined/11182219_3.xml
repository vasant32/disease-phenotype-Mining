<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In antigen presenting cells (APC), TNFalpha increased antigen presentation, notably by up-regulation of HLA class II expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to their role in antigen presentation, HLA-DR molecules transduce intracellular signals which lead to cytokine up-regulation or cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously observed that the susceptibility of APC to HLA-DR mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> increase throughout their maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the relationship between TNFalpha production and susceptibility to HLA-DR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of different APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic progenitor cell line (KG1), monocytic cell line (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1), monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC), and B-lymphoid cell line (Raji) have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> susceptibility and spontaneous TNFalpha release are correlated in these different cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, while autocrine TNFalpha production was critical for DC maturation, upregulation of TNFalpha release after HLA-DR crosslinking was not observed and neutralization of endogenous TNFalpha did not modify HLA-DR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data reveal that HLA-DR mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> susceptibility and spontaneous TNFalpha release are regulated in a parallel manner and that while TNFalpha may induce maturation of APC to an "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> sensitive" stage, there is no direct role for TNFalpha in HLA-DR-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of APC </plain></SENT>
