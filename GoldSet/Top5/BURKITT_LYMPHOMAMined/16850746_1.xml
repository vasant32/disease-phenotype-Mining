<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper was designed to investigate the expression of HDAC1 of Raji cells and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on their proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were treated with 3.125-50 micromol/L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> for 8-48 h and the growth inhibition rates of Raji cells were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of HDAC1 on Raji cells were examined by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, Western blot at 24 h various concertrations (1.6-50 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> could selectively inhibit the proliferation of Raji cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with the inhibition rate being 52.47 %-82.18 % (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The up-regulation of HDAC1 expression was observed within 24 h after the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> as shown by RT-PCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the increase of concentration, the expression was down-regulated in a dose- dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of HDAC1 plays an important role in the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> can inhibit the growth of Raji cells at various concentrations and promote the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
