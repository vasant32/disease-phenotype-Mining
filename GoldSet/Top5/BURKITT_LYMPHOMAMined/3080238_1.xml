<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of five surface antigens in eight Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines during different phases of the cell cycle and in different growth phases (logarithmic and stationary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were stained simultaneously for surface antigens (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> coupled antibodies) and DNA content (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi>), and dual parameter measurements were performed with a flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cells in specific cell cycle phases during log-phase growth revealed a 1.6-fold increase in surface antigen expression as cells passaged from G1 to G2/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is almost identical to the measured increase in cell surface area which occurs during passage of cells through the cell cycle and indicates that under optimal conditions surface antigen density is maintained during cell doubling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also observed a consistent reduction, by about 50%, in the expression of surface IgM (mu), k-light chain, and B1 on the cell lines during a 5-day culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that only weakly expressed surface IgM were found to have a more rapid decrease, and in such cell lines IgM was ultimately completely lost from the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of beta 2-microglobulin and HLA-ABC increased in some cell lines, whereas in others a significant decrease of both beta 2-microglobulin and HLA expression was demonstrated as the cells entered stationary growth phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased cell volume (and therefore surface area) associated with declining growth rate and fewer late S or G2/M cells could account for 20-30% of the observed reduction in surface IgM, k-light chain, and B1 expression, but the major decrement in fluorescence intensity was due to a reduction in the density of these surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the ability to maintain surface antigen densities is frequently lost in suboptimal culture conditions </plain></SENT>
