<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Both EBV-infected Raji cells and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) were infected with HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunofluoresence assay (IFA) with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against HHV-6 was applied to confirm the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of HHV-6 in the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of EBV antigen was examined by IFA using human anti-EBV serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following HHV-6 infection, cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in Raji cells but not in LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HHV-6 were detected in both cell lines by IFA with anti-HHV-6 MAb, but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV antigens were detected by IFA with human serum against EBV in both HHV-6 infected cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data in this study suggest that HHV-6 promotes the expression of EBV antigen and may contribute to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in cooperation with EBV </plain></SENT>
