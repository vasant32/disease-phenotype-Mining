<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells recognize non-peptidic phosphoantigens that are present in some microbial extracts, as well as the beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cytotoxic human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells express inhibitory natural killer cell receptors for HLA class I that downmodulate the responses of the gammadelta T lymphocytes against HLA class I expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that transfection of the human beta(2)-microglobulin cDNA into Daudi cells markedly inhibits the cytotoxic and proliferative responses of human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This provides direct evidence that the "innate" specificity of human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T-lymphocytes for Daudi cells is uncovered by the loss of beta(2)m by Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, Daudi cells that express HLA class I in association with mouse beta(2)m at the cell surface are recognized by human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells close to the same degree as the parental HLA class I deficient Daudi cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, proper conformation of the HLA class I molecules is required for binding to natural killer cell receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cloning of the HLA class I A, B, and C molecules of Daudi cells and transfer of the individual HLA class I molecules of Daudi cells into the HLA class I deficient recipient cell lines.221 and C1R demonstrate that for some human gammadelta T-cell clones cytolysis can be entirely inhibited by single HLA class I alleles while for other clones single HLA class I alleles only partially inhibit cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, most human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells represent a population of killer cells that evolved like NK cells to destroy target cells that have lost expression of individual HLA class I molecules but with a specificity that is determined by the Vgamma9/Vdelta2 TCR </plain></SENT>
