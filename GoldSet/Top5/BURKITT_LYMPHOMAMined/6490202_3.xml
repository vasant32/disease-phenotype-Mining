<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, electro-transfer to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">cellulose nitrate</z:chebi> and "blotting" with radioiodinated lectins, reveals an increase in the molecular weight of one band from around 190 kd to 220 kd, in each case coinciding with the acquisition of the tumorigenic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Probing the electrotransfers with a monoclonal antibody demonstrates that the altered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is a member of the "leukocyte common antigen" family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase in molecular weight is due to the addition of carbohydrate residues which are removed by treatment with neuraminidase and endoglycosidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening a larger number of lymphoid cell lines, including those derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, shows an excellent correlation between tumorigenicity and altered molecular weight of a leukocyte common antigen </plain></SENT>
