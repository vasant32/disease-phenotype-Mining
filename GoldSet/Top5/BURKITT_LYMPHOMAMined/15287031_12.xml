<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant MYC expression is caused by (1) chromosomal translocation to one of the loci carrying an immunoglobulin gene, (2) mutation within the translocated allele, (3) loss of the block to transcription elongation, or (4) promoter shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the influence of breakpoint locations within the MYC gene on MYC transcript levels, we determined both the precise genomic MYC/IGH breakpoints and the amount of MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 25 samples of pediatric Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with breakpoints that were 5' from MYC exon 1 had significantly lower expression of MYC than did patients who had a breakpoint within exon 1 or intron 1 (P &lt; 0.05 and 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of MYC (1,006 copies per 100 copies ABL1) was detected in patients with loss of the first exon and transcription initiation from a cryptic P3 promoter within the first intron of the MYC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no obvious correlation between breakpoint locations within the IgH locus and the amount of MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
