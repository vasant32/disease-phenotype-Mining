<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anti-B1/CD20 pan-B-cell MoAb reactive with human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> but not reactive with mouse B-cells was used in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing human Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts were given injections of 2.5 muCi (0.3 microgram) 131I-labeled anti-B1 with or without a 2-h prior single injection of 100 micrograms of unlabeled anti-B1 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four days later the animals given injections of 131I-labeled anti-B1 and the unlabeled anti-B1 predose had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake of 12.72 +/- 1.17% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of injected dose/g which was 44% greater than the animals receiving the 131I-labeled anti-B1 alone (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The uptake in most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues was unchanged, although the blood level of 131I-labeled anti-B1 appeared to be greater following unlabeled anti-B1 predosing (P = 0.067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predosing with isotype matched irrelevant MoAb did not result in a greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake or blood concentration of 131I-labeled anti-B1 compared to the administration of 131I-labeled anti-B1 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In studies using 111In-labeled anti-B1, the effect of unlabeled antibody predosing was more pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For animals given injections of 4.5 muCi (0.4 microgram) 111In-labeled anti-B1 and the unlabeled anti-B1 predose, the uptake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was 12.37 +/- 2.07% of injected dose/g which was 162% greater than the animals receiving the 111In-labeled anti-B1 alone (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predosing decreased 111In-labeled anti-B1 uptake in spleen, while the blood level was significantly greater </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing mice were either simultaneously given injections of 36 micrograms of unlabeled anti-B1 and 4 micrograms 111In-labeled anti-B1 or were given preinjections of 36 micrograms unlabeled anti-B1 3 h prior to injection of 4 micrograms 111In-labeled anti-B1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake 3 days later was 1.3-fold higher in the animals which received the preinjection of unlabeled antibody (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the quantity of unlabeled anti-B1 was increased (36, 96, 996 micrograms) in the predose, significantly greater uptake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was observed, although this uptake appeared to plateau at the highest predoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
