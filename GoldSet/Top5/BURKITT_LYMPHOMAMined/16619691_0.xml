<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> based regimens can produce remission rates approaching 60 to 80% in endemic Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, relapses and refractory disease are fairly common in developing countries, due to advanced stage disease and cost-constraints in the implementation of optimal chemotherapeutic protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an affordable, tolerable and targeted approach to chemotherapy for endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as would be desirable in resource poor settings such as Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We present data and review pertinent literature that indicates that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agent</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">Zidovudine</z:chebi> specifically targets this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> through a unique and novel mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCE: Our original studies, publications original and review articles searched in Pubmed indexed for Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review to identify studies relating to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">Zidovudine</z:chebi>, EBV+ and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, indicating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">zidovudine</z:chebi> targeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in a unique and novel mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Our data and a qualitative assessment of the relevant literature was undertaken, given the heterogenicity of the study types making it inappropriate to pool results across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that the incorporation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">Zidovudine</z:chebi> into Burkitt's regimens may enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> kill and abbreviate the duration of treatment necessary for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the addition of the widely available and inexpensive agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi>, markedly potentiates the tumorcidal activity of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">Zidovudine</z:chebi> in Epstein Barr virus positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that further clinical studies in patients afflicted with this disease are needed to clearly define this potential use of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">Zidovudine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
