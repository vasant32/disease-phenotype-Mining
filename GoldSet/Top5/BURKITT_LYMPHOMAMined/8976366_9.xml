<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and a dic(9;20) are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients were diagnosed with pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>, and the three for whom information was available were CD10+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis ranged from 23 months to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved remission, with two in continuous remission for 2 years 6 months and 3 years, one patient relapsed, dying 3 years 2 months after diagnosis, and one patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These four patients were initially diagnosed as having a deletion of 9p and loss of one chromosome 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Re-examination of the karyotypes indicated a possible dic(9;20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dicentric chromosome was verified using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes for chromosomes 9 and 20 on interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients had multiple chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the translocation; one was hypodiploid, one was pseudodiploid, and two were hyperdiploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This dicentric chromosome was recently described in four adult and nine pediatric patients with ALL [8, 9] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reported patients had CD10+ pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>, and achieved remission, as was the case for our four pediatric dic(9;20) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of our three patients for whom follow-up is available are in continuous remission as were two adults and five pediatric patients in the previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies confirm the dic(9;20) as a recurring abnormality in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Due to the subtle nature of the translocation, FISH is very useful in confirming the chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
