<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We show, in this study, that type I IFN induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21WAF1 in the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell-line Daudi and ensuing cell cycle arrest correlate with the terminal differentiation of these cells, and is ultimately followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of p21WAF1 paralleled the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of G1 arrest and the reduction of surface IgM expression which was used as a marker of the differentiation response, and the IFN treated cells acquired a typical plasma cell-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The type II IFN IFNgamma, which does not inhibit the growth of Daudi cells, did not induce the expression of p21WAF1, nor affect the expression of surface IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The induction of p21WAF1 which paralleled the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein, pRB, was preceded by the strong reduction in c-myc levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that the coupled down-regulation of c-myc and induction of p21WAF1 may be crucial to the induction of differentiation and G1 arrest in Daudi cells by type I IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>Growth arrest</z:mpath> and differentiation was followed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and was accompanied by the induction of the activity of the apoptotic ICE-family protease CPP32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G1 arrest and differentiation followed by apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are characteristics of terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest that the induction of p21WAF1 and G1 arrest mediated by type I IFN in Daudi cells is part of terminal differentiation response in these cells, highlighting a role for type I IFN as B cell terminal differentiation factors </plain></SENT>
