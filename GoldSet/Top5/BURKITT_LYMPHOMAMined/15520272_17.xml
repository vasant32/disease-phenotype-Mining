<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The plasma membrane of cells is an ordered environment, giving rise to anisotropic orientation and restricted motion of molecules and proteins residing in the membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the same time as being an organized matrix of defined structure, the cell membrane is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and dynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present a method where we use fluorescence imaging of linear dichroism to measure the orientation of molecules relative to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By detecting linear dichroism as well as fluorescence anisotropy, the orientation parameters are separated from dynamic properties such as rotational diffusion and homo energy transfer (energy migration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the technique is enhanced by using two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> excitation for higher photo-selection compared to single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that we can accurately image <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> organization in whole cell membranes and in delicate structures such as membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50796">nanotubes</z:chebi> connecting two cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The speed of our wide-field imaging system makes it possible to image changes in orientation and anisotropy occurring on a subsecond timescale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated by time-lapse studies showing that cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> rapidly disrupts the orientation of a fluorophore located within the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane but not of a surface bound probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with cholesterol having an important role in stabilizing and ordering the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> tails within the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
