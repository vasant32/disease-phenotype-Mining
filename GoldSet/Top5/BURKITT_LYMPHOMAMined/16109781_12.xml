<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe high antitumor activity of a novel immunotoxin, 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P, composed of 2 Rap molecules, each fused to the N terminus of the light chain of hLL1, an internalizing anti-CD74 humanized antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reduce unwanted side effects, the constant region of hLL1 was changed from gamma1 to gamma4 and further to gamma4P by replacing serine228 to proline to prevent the formation of a half immunoglobulin G (IgG) common for IgG4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro, 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P retained RNase activity, specific binding to CD74, and was significantly more potent against CD74+ cell lines (Daudi, Raji, and MC/CAR) than naked hLL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the pharmacokinetic profile of 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P was similar to that of naked hLL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated dose of 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P in severe combined immunodeficient mice (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) or BALB/c mice was 50 microg per mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Raji and Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e>, treatment with a single 5 to 50 microg dose of 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P, given as early or delayed treatment, resulted in cures of most animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P was significantly better than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls, including saline, naked hLL1, and nonspecific immunotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 2L-Rap-hLL1-gamma4P demonstrated excellent in vitro and in vivo efficacy and thus merits further consideration as a therapeutic for CD74+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
