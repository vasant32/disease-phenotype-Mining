<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify potential predictors of relapse and to elucidate the mechanisms of immune control of leukemic blasts we examined the expression of cytokines, costimulatory molecules and members of the TNF family in leukemic marrow samples in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from 49 consecutive pediatric patients with B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP ALL) were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified interleukin (IL)-10 expression as a significant adverse prognostic indicator in childhood BCP-ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The event free survival (EFS) of patients expressing IL-10 mRNA in high quantity was significantly lower compared with patients expressing low IL-10 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taqman RT-PCR of sorted cell populations showed that IL-10 mRNA was synthetized almost exclusively by NK or T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found an increased expression of IL-1, IL-4, CD86 and VEGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in patients with late relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possibly, ALL cells mediate a Th2 shift through increased expression of CD86 and thereby influence the individual relapse risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasize the role of the immune system for the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
