<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms leading to malignant cell proliferation may differ between the different histologic forms of high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyze the potential role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a growth factor for lymphomatous cells in these different forms, the in situ production of this cytokine was analyzed in lymphomatous samples taken from 24 patients, 18 of whom were human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>), seven diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization experiments showed that the IL-6 gene was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of IL-6 gene-expressing cells was 7 times higher in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, and it was 17 times higher than that of 14 control lymph nodes displaying a benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002729'>follicular hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of individual cases indicated that the level of IL-6 gene expression was strongly correlated with the presence of immunoblasts within the malignant clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, this level was not correlated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or with the HIV status of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies with an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody showed that IL-6 was produced in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the former, IL-6 mainly originated from reactive, nonmalignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> also showed that malignant cells produced the 80-Kd chain of the IL-6 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 may act as a growth factor in some forms of high-grade B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of immunoblasts may be an indicator of such forms </plain></SENT>
