<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Determination of the activity of both the antibody and drug moieties was carried out in vitro using a pre-B cell human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell line (NALM-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 23% loss in antibody binding and a 20-fold loss in drug activity were observed upon conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective cytotoxicity for CD19+ cells, however, was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the cytotoxicity, antibody activity and release of the breakdown product, 14-OH-Ida, showed that the conjugates remained stable for more than 100 days after lyophilization and storage at -20 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies were performed in irradiated nu/nu mice bearing NALM-6 tumours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial dose response studies with free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> demonstrated that three i.p. doses (every other day) of 10 micrograms resulted in little antitumour activity, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals by day 23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same treatment regime using 15 micrograms Ida-anti-CD19 conjugate caused the disappearance of four out of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> with three complete cures and no evidence of toxicity as assessed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of a conjugate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> with an irrelevant antibody at this dose led to no significant antitumour response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The administration of free drug at a dose of 6 micrograms resulted in a minor antitumour response but high toxicity, whereas injection of Ida-anti-CD19 conjugate at this dose caused no toxicity and a substantial antitumour effect with eradication of two out of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results clearly demonstrate that the administration of Ida-anti-CD19 conjugates can result in complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> regression in an experimental model </plain></SENT>
