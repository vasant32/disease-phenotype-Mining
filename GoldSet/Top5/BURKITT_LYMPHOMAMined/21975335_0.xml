<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This calls for intensified efforts to validate the global prognostic markers within local settings for improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study proposes prognostic markers for enhanced eBL treatment and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD One hundred and eighty histologically and/or clinically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana were eligible for this cross-sectional eight-year retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical, clinical and demographic data, before chemotherapy administration, were documented and examined for their progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A mean age of 6 (SD=2.7, range: 1-16) years was observed with general male dominance (M:F=1.69:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (HR=2.04; 95% CI, 1.25-3.32; log rank=8.3; p=0.004), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (HR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.62-7.98; log rank=15.4; p=0.002) and St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Jude stage (HR=1.74; 95% CI, 1.11-2.73; log rank=8.0; p=0.015) were important independent prognostic biochemical markers for both PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, serum calcium, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> were non-prognostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION The better monitoring of these prognostic indices coupled with risk-stratification treatment may improve patients' survival, especially in resource-limited settings </plain></SENT>
