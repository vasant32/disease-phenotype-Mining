<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The membrane-associated and cytoplasmic Ig as well as receptors for sheep erythrocytes, Fc gamma and C3d receptors were analyzed on cryostate sections and in suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some cases, a more precise immunophenotype was achieved by the use of monoclonal antibodies detecting different T and B cell antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight per cent of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had B-cell, five per cent T cell and 7 per cent non-B/non-T <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CBCC and CC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed monotypic Ig, but only 66 per cent of the CB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone did not consistently predict immunophenotype in large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A simultaneous expression of multiple heavy chains and cytoplasmic Ig was found in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting an intratumoral differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nodular or irregular tissue distribution patterns for Ig and C3d receptors found in histologically diffuse follicle derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> also suggest intratumoral variations in the marker expression, probably related to differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> immunophenotype is important in obtaining a definite diagnosis in large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that it may lead to a better understanding of the differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
