<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cells with type III latency were more susceptible to killing by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> than those with type I latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of EBV lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by inducing cleavage of caspases 8 and 9; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was inhibited by pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> reduced the levels of the p50 and p65 components of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway and reduced the level of p52 in the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway, which is induced by EBV LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> inhibited expression of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and XIAP, which are regulated by NF-kappaB and function as inhibitors of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">Bortezomib</z:chebi> did not inhibit expression of several other antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> significantly prolonged the survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> mice inoculated with LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of certain EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
