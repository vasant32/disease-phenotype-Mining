<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus BRLF1 and BZLF1 genes are the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes transcribed upon induction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein products of both genes (referred to here as Rta and Zta, respectively) activate expression of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes, thereby initiating the lytic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens expressed upon induction of the lytic cycle, however, Zta is unique in its ability to disrupt <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency; expression of the BZLF1 gene is both necessary and sufficient for triggering the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that Zta can activate its own promoter (Zp), through binding to two Zta recognition sequences (ZIIIA and ZIIIB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe mutant Zta proteins that do not bind DNA (referred to as Zta DNA-binding mutants [Zdbm]) but retain the ability to transactivate Zp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the inability of these mutants to bind DNA, transactivation of Zp by Zdbm is not dependent on the Zta recognition sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, transactivation by Zdbm is dependent upon promoter elements that bind cellular factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An examination of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular promoters identified promoters that are weakly responsive or unresponsive to Zdbm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An analysis of a panel of artificial promoters containing one copy of various promoter elements demonstrated a specificity for Zdbm activation that is distinct from that of Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that non-DNA-binding forms of some transactivators retain the ability to transactivate specific target promoters without direct binding to DNA </plain></SENT>
