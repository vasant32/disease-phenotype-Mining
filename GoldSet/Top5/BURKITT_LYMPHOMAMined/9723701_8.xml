<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Greater than 90% of the human population acquire Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in infancy and retain a lifelong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> without any clinical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless EBV has been identified as the causal agent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, and is associated with several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> including endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immunosupressed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B cells infected with EBV are transformed in vitro and grow continuously as lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth of EBV-transformed B cells in vivo is controlled by the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies on immunity to EBV have mainly focused on MHC class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells specific for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here it is reported that in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes by autologous EBV-infected B cells, which have been induced to express lytic cycle antigens, gives rise to a predominantly CD4+ T cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the growth of EBV-infected B cells can also be regulated by these activated CD4+ T cells through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by CD95-CD95 ligand (CD95L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD95-CD95L-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is an important mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell growth regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As EBV-transformed B cells remain susceptible to this mechanism, the control of EBV in vivo may be not only by virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell immunity but also by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mechanisms of immune regulation of B cell growth </plain></SENT>
