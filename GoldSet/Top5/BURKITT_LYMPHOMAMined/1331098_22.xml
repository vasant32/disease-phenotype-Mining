<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we have addressed the roles of spatial constraints and stereospecific alignment between the upstream S and X elements, and the X and Y elements, in both constitutive and interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN)-induced expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the constitutive expression in B cell lines (B-LCL) has previously shown that the X and Y elements must be stereoaligned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further study reveals that any spacing changes between S and X, regardless of the helical alignment of these two elements, is not tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These same restraints are involved in an inducible system, because the response to gamma-IFN treatment requires both stereo alignment between the X and Y elements and precise spacing between the S and X elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither constitutive nor inducible expression can be restored by correcting the distance and spacing between only the S and Y elements with misalignment of X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results reveal a common pathway for constitutive and inducible expression that may require either direct or indirect protein complex formation among proteins bound to three highly conserved regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have also evaluated the role of the A/T-rich sequence located immediately 5' of the Y element and show that it exerts little effect on constitutive and gamma-IFN induced DRA expression </plain></SENT>
