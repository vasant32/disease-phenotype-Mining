<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there is a 2-fold increase of mutations at A relative to T on the non-transcribed strand of the V genes but it is unclear what triggers such strand bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an efficient mutagenesis system that recapitulates characteristic features of Ig gene hypermutation in the GC B cells, we found that low levels of AID induced similar frequency of mutations at A and T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, high levels of AID specifically increased mutations at A, but not T, leading to strand bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results explain why strand bias of A:T mutations is observed only in the highly mutated V genes but not in the less mutated switch region or the BCL-6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High levels of AID also increased the proportion of transversions at G relative to transversions at C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results identify a clue to the strand bias of A:T mutations and provide an in vitro model to elucidate this unsolved mystery in the hypermutation field </plain></SENT>
