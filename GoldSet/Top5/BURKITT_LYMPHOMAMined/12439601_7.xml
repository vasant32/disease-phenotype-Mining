<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interindividual differences in lymphoblast accumulation of MTX and its active metabolites, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53376">polyglutamates</z:chebi> (MTXPG), may contribute to the effectiveness of treatment among ALL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand these differences in MTXPG accumulation, we developed a model to characterize the cellular influx and efflux of MTX, formation of MTXPG by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> residues catalyzed by FPGS (folylpolyglutamate synthetase), and cleavage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> residues from MTXPG by GGH (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24190">gamma-glutamyl</z:chebi> hydrolase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model was fitted to in vivo intracellular MTXPG concentrations measured serially in leukemic blasts from 20 newly diagnosed patients with ALL treated with 24-h intravenous infusions of MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed median concentrations of total MTXPG at 44 h was higher in B-lineage than in T-cell ALL (1706 vs 518 pmol/10(9) cells, P&lt;0.025), consistent with the higher estimated Vmax for FPGS activity in B-lineage vs T-lineage blasts (414 vs 93 pmol/10(9) cells/h, P&lt;0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simulations based on the model-estimated parameters indicated greater accumulation of MTX, MTXPGs (MTXPG(2-7)) and total MTX (MTXPG(1-7)) with longer MTX infusions and with higher MTX doses, with the highest concentrations in hyperdiploid B-lineage, intermediate in non-hyperdiploid B-lineage, and lowest in T-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences provide mechanistic and treatment insights for lineage and ploidy differences in MTXPG accumulation in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
