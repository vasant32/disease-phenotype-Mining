<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a first case of HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HAL) presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (AKI) and inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096197" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune reconstitution syndrome</z:e> (IRIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old male, treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) for one month prior to admission, developed AKI, left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumor</z:e>, and recurrent swelling of the right parotid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumor</z:e> exhibited features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy showed hydro-degeneration of renal tubules, interstitial inflammatory cells, and a small number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in the sub-capsule, compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001970'>interstitial nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> rapidly recovered following chemotherapy and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> concomitantly with a decrease in HIV-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level and an increase in CD4+ cells after the first cycle of chemotherapy, which spontaneously resolved after the second cycle of chemotherapy without additional anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> drugs; thus, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IRIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that IRIS may frequently develop during chemotherapy for HAL, but may be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was coinfected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV), which genotypes known as is associated with liver-related mortality and response to antiviral therapy; recently, an intimate interplay between HIV and HBV in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we addressed the HBV genotype in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that he exhibited a mixed genotype (A/E) not native to Japan and primarily found in Europe and North America or West Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that universal vaccination for juveniles against HBV is warranted in Japan </plain></SENT>
