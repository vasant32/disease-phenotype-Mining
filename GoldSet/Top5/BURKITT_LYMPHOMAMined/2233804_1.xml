<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An existing mutant Raji cell line which lacks <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase activity had previously been shown to be Mex- and to no longer express O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that in addition to the methyltransferase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase, a third enzyme with an unrelated function, galactokinase, is also not expressed in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase expression is post-transcriptional and it is possible that galactokinase and methyltransferase can share a common post-transcriptional regulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase </plain></SENT>
