<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed for pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> the relative importance of prognostic factors previously demonstrated to predict outcome in B-precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting clinical and laboratory features were correlated with outcome for 441 children 12 months to 21 years of age with previously untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, registered on the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group (POG) T3 protocol between 1986 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> prognostic factor analyses were then compared to similar analyses for 1993 patients with B-precursor ALL enrolled during the same time period on the POG ALinC 14 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative interaction between phenotype and each prognostic factor was studied to determine the relative importance of the prognostic factor for each of the two major immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the importance of maturational stage as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> prognostic factor, using a modified Ludwig definition of maturational stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that several of the clinical and laboratory prognostic factors, which are used reliably for B-precursor ALL, are much less predictive in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (ie age, WBC, consensus risk group, hyperdiploidy, presence of trans- locations and CALLA expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the phenotypes in the prognostic importance of race or gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate a significant difference in outcome among the three maturational stages of T-cell ALL, with the intermediate group faring best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using traditional risk group criteria to stratify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> for therapy may not be appropriate </plain></SENT>
