<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The PVT1 locus is identified as a cluster of T(2;8) and T(8;22) "variant" MYC-activating chromosomal translocation breakpoints extending 400 kb downstream of MYC in a subset (approximately 20%) of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (vBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports that microRNAs (miRNA) may be associated with fragile sites and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated genomic regions prompted us to investigate whether the PVT1 region on chromosome 8q24 may contain miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computational analysis of the genomic sequence covering the PVT1 locus and experimental verification identified seven miRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One miRNA, hsa-miR-1204, resides within a previously described PVT1 exon (1b) that is often fused to the immunoglobulin light chain constant region in vBLs and is present in high copy number in MYC/PVT1-amplified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like its human counterpart, mouse mmu-miR-1204 represents the closest miRNA to Myc (~50 kb) and is found only 1 to 2 kb downstream of a cluster of retroviral integration sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another miRNA, mmu-miR-1206, is close to a cluster of variant translocation breakpoints associated with mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> and exon 1 of mouse Pvt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the miRNA precursor transcripts are expressed at higher levels in late-stage B cells (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> and vBL cell lines) compared with immature B cells, suggesting possible roles in lymphoid development and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the miR-1204 precursor (human and mouse) in a mouse pre-B-cell line increased expression of Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High levels of expression of the hsa-miR-1204 precursor is also seen in several epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines with MYC/PVT1 coamplification, suggesting a potentially broad role for these miRNAs in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
