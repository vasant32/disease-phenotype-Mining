<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is an important immunomodulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas large amounts of data have been accumulated regarding IFN gamma gene expression in these two cell types, little information about IFN gamma expression in other cell types exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have analyzed the production of IFN gamma by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-cell line, JLP(c), derived from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and another human B-cell line, PA682BM-1, which was derived from an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis indicates the presence of an Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement, but no rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta chain gene or IFN gamma gene in these B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines were found to express surface IgD and other B-cell surface markers, thus confirming their B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis for surface Ig, cytoplasmic Ig, and secreted Ig indicates that the two cell lines are in relatively early stages of the B-cell differentiation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now report that PA682BM-1 can be triggered by the protein kinase C (PKC) activators, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and (-)Indolactam-v, to secrete IFN gamma, whereas JLP(c) cells spontaneously produce low levels of IFN gamma that can be enhanced by PKC activators and interleukin-2 (IL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After activation of the cell lines with IL-2, (-)Indolactam-v, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, increases in cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>) of IFN gamma and the IL-2 receptor chains were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of IFN gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein by IL-2 was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody to IL-2 receptor p75 (beta chain), but not by the monoclonal antibody to p55 (alpha chain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of IFN gamma genomic DNA indicates that the gene is not amplified, but that hypomethylation in the 5' noncoding region of the IFN gamma gene has occurred in the B-cell line from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient that spontaneously produces IFN gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the methylation state of the promoter region may play an important role in the control of IFN gamma gene expression in B cells </plain></SENT>
