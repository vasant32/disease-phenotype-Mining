<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The thesis is put forward that by entering the cell nucleus, the virus renders malignant lymphoid cells more vulnerable to cytotoxic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence a deliberate policy of EB virus inoculation before starting chemotherapy might achieve a more rapid response and longer remissions in indigenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the temperate zones, and might possibly render drug-resistant cases once more drug-sensitive </plain></SENT>
