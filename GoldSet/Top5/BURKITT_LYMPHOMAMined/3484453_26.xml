<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in irradiated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells the disturbance of plasma membrane permeability precedes the decrease of DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome degradation in dying thymocytes of irradiated or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>-treated rats is accounted for by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postirradiation DNA cleavage in the 3 investigated cell cultures is disorderly and is probably caused by the activation of hydrolases in dead cells </plain></SENT>
