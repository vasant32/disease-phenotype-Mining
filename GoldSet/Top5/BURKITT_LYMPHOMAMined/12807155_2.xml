<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Although the outcome of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) has improved dramatically over the last decade, some children still fare poorly and relapses are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of leukaemic cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> has emerged as an important prognostic factor in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The t(9,22) translocation, resulting in the bcr-abl fusion gene, is a non-random translocation found in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also known to be an independent poor prognostic factor for long-term disease free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the association between the presence of bcr-abl fusion gene and in vitro <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> resistance in children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 23 children (aged 1-16 yr, median age: 12 yr) with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> at diagnosis were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of bcr-abl fusion gene was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the in-vitro resistance to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was measured by short term colorimetric <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> thiazol tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A median LD50 (lethal dose for 50% cells) for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in bcr-abl positive children (n=7) was 1.6 mg/ml (range: 0.25-5.0 mg/ml) and that of bcr-abl negative children (n=16) was 0.35 mg/ml (range 0.62-1.0 mg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median LD50 for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> differed significantly between the bcr-abl positive and negative groups of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: This is probably the first report to show that leukaemic blasts of bcr-abl positive children with ALL are about four-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> as compared to blasts from bcr-abl negative children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of bcr-abl positive ALL could be a lower steroid sensitivity </plain></SENT>
