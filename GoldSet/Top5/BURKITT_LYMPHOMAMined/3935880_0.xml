<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of intracellular cytoplasmic immunoglobulin M (IgM) in leukemic cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) was investigated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to develop a reproducible flow cytometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived B-cell line, Daudi, and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e>, Nalm-6, served as prototypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> B cells and cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) were used as negative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic mu was expressed in 77.3 +/- 7.5% (n = 10) of Nalm-6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CALLA+ ALL and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cells lacked cytoplasmic mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surface-membrane immunoglobulin on the viable B cells was blocked with purified goat anti-human IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the B cells were fixed in cold absolute <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> and stained with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated goat anti-human IgM to demonstrate cytoplasmic IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the surface-membrane IgM was blocked, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells had no cytoplasmic IgM (0.3-0.5% positive cells) detectable by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the peripheral blood lymphocytes from five patients with CLL and the Daudi cells contained cytoplasmic IgM, ranging from 7.8 to 76.7% and 45.7 to 89.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cytoplasmic mu in Nalm-6, CLL, and Daudi cells can be easily and rapidly demonstrated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
