<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent large retrospective studies confirm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> significantly increases risk of developing small bowel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by 30 to 40 percent and other gut <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> by 83-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old man with a history of CD of two-year duration presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and 20-pound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of three weeks duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a vague non-tender mass in the right hypochondrium, and his stools tested positive for occult blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lab values were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, except for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of 11mg/dL, MCV 75, mildly elevated SGOT of 61 IU/L, and LDH of about 5000 IU/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Work-up including computerized tomography (CT) scan, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scan, and colonoscopy were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A CT scan of the abdomen showed extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinomatosis</z:e>, scattered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, and small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PET scan results coincided with CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy revealed a friable nodular mass in the hepatic flexure, histopathology of which confirmed a high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry following immunostaining was positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD45, CD79a, and Ki-67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FISH assay demonstrated t (14:18) translocation and bcl-2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow biopsy showed evidence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with rituximab, plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, Adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP-R), with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Currently, the patient remains in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first case of aggressive Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>) occurring in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in his eighth decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is possible that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, profound immunosuppression, and nutritional deficit could lead to development of high-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further molecular studies are warranted to the investigate the link between certain polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in B-cell populations in the gut, and this might be useful to identify high-risk individuals in the population of patients with CD </plain></SENT>
