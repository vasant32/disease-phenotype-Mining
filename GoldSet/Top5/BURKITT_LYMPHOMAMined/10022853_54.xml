<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that reestablishment of type I latency in EBV-negative Akata cells restores tumorigenicity and that tumorigenic potential correlates with an increased resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> under growth-limiting conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antiapoptotic effect of EBV was associated with a higher level of Bcl-2 expression and an EBV-dependent decrease in steady-state levels of c-MYC protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the EBV EBNA-1 protein is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is reported to have oncogenic potential, enforced expression of EBNA-1 alone in EBV-negative Akata cells failed to restore tumorigenicity or EBV-dependent down-regulation of c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data provide direct evidence that EBV contributes to the tumorigenic potential of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and suggest a novel model whereby a restricted latency program of EBV promotes B-cell survival, and thus virus persistence within an immune host, by selectively targeting the expression of c-MYC </plain></SENT>
