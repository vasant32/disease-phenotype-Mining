<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the periphery, the TCR gamma delta population has a restricted combinatorial repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TCRD-V1 and -V2 gene products are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion, whereas, the TCRD-V2 and the TCRG-V9 encoded proteins show, in general, a coordinated expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed conservation of the restriction sites that identify the TCRG-V9 and TCRD-V2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The human TCRG-V9 locus has two alleles, TCRG-V9A1 and TCRG-V9A2 differing at codon position 31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chimpanzee TCRG-V9 gene product differs from the products of the human TCRG-V9A1 and TCRG-V9A2 allele by two and three amino acid replacements, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The human and the chimpanzee TCRG-V9-TCRD-V2 lymphocytes show a similar specific proliferative and cytolytic response to human Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the amino acid replacements found in the chimpanzee TCRG-V9 gene product do not change the superantigen specificity across this species barrier </plain></SENT>
