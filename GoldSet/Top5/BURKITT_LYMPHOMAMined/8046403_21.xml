<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The switch between latency and lytic replication was previously shown, for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, to depend on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> BZLF1 gene product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein-DNA assays were used to identify the cis-acting elements that represent the link between regulating signal transduction pathways and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cascade of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific binding of proteins to several sites of the BZLF1 promoter during latency was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of the lytic cycle by stimulation with 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol 13-acetate</z:chebi> abolished the binding of these proteins to the distal promoter (positions -227 to -551), suggesting a functional role for the down-regulation of promoter activity during latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer analysis identified a multiply repeated sequence motif, HI, in this region and exonuclease III footprints confirmed that these sites act as specific protein recognition sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a set of reporter plasmids we were able to demonstrate a negative regulatory effect of the HI motif in some B lymphoid cell lines, in contrast to epithelial HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The HI silencer elements are different from other silencer elements described so far in respect of their sequence and protein-binding pattern during the activation of BZLF1 </plain></SENT>
