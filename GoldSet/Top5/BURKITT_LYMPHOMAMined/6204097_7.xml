<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from 24 of 27 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (BLCL) were found to have an absent (16 lines) or decreased (8 lines) expression of vimentin IFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, non-Burkitt's malignant lymphoid cell lines (5 lines) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells (45 lines) exhibited a well-developed vimentin IFM network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, low expression of vimentin was also found in 3 LCL derived from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023003" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TRPS2">Langer-Giedion syndrome</z:e>, which is characterized by a deletion of the distal end of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of vimentin-negative BLCL and Langer-Giedion LCL with azacytidine led to a transient reexpression of vimentin </plain></SENT>
