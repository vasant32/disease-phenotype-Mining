<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding activities of the 170 kDa and the 180 kDa human topoisomerases II (topo II alpha and topo II beta) to linear DNA fragments with different degrees of curvature were characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In gel retardation experiments it was shown that both forms of the enzyme bind preferentially to a curved 287 bp fragment, forming a detectable stable complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The affinity for straight DNA fragments of similar length is significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both a commercially available topo II alpha, isolated from placenta, and topo II alpha and topo II beta purified from nuclear extracts of the Namalwa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue culture line gave similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of double-stranded poly[d(A-T)], poly[d(G-C)], supercoiled plasmid DNA and linear Z-DNA on the topo II-complex with curved DNA were analyzed in competition experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hierarchy of affinities of the 180 kDa topo II beta for these DNAs has the order: linear left-handed DNA &gt; supercoiled DNA &gt; or = curved DNA &gt;&gt; poly[d(A-T)] &gt; poly[d(G-C)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 170 kDa topo II alpha binds with similar affinity to curved DNA and linear Z-DNA &gt; or = supercoiled DNA &gt;&gt; linear B-DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data imply that human topoisomerase II binding is more sensitive to DNA secondary structure than to DNA sequence per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of the enzyme to preferentially recognize a wide variety of sequences in unusual secondary structures suggests a mode of targeting the enzyme in vivo to regions of high negative supercoiling </plain></SENT>
