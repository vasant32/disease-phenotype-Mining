<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously isolated phosphorylated CR2 from purified Raji cell nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the nuclear localization of CR2 by electron microscope immunochemistry of thin sections of Raji cells and we have compared the binding properties of CR2 expressed on purified plasma membranes or nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-CR2 mAb immunogold labeling of thin sections of Raji cells identified CR2 at the nuclear surface and also within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear envelope associated CR2 was localized mainly at nuclear pores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the nucleus, CR2 was associated with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interchromatin fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This labeling was preserved in nuclear matrix preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CR2 expressed on the surfaces of purified nuclei or on the cell surface interacted with soluble and particle-bound C3bi/C3d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal anti-CR2 antibodies, which recognized extracellular domains of CR2, reacted differently with CR2 depending on its subcellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of CR2 in nuclei may be due to translocation of the cell surface CR2 and/or the presence of two distinct intracellular pathways for mature CR2 </plain></SENT>
