<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By this procedure a subline of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (RAJI) was made 290-fold resistant (RAJI/MTX-R), T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells (CCRF-CEM) were obtained 210-fold resistant (CEM/MTX-R), and 3 MTX-resistant human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> lines were selected: TE-85/MTX-R (19-fold resistant; relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>); MG-63/MTX-R (8-fold resistant); and SAOS-2/MTX-R (200-fold resistant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied a B-cell lymphoblastoid line, WI-L2/m4, that was 13,000-fold resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assay of cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (DHFR) showed the following pattern of activity in resistant cell lines, relative to parental cell activity: RAJI/MTX-R, 550-fold increased; CEM/MTX-R, unchanged; TE-85/MTX-R, 4-fold increased; MG-63/MTX-R, 6-fold increased; SAOS-2/MTX-R, unchanged; and WI-L2/m4, 110-fold increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of MTX membrane transport showed decreased uptake in CEM/MTX-R and SAOS-2/MTX-R, relative to parental cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other DHFR-overproducing cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gave <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial MTX uptake rates but increased total uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DHFR-overproducing lines <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had significant cross-resistance to both metoprine and trimetrexate; the two lines with defective MTX transport were not cross-resistant, and the CEM/MTX-R cells showed collateral sensitivity to these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only minor cross-resistance to homofolic acid was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MTX-resistant lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highly MTX-resistant RAJI/MTX-R and WI-L2/m4 cells showed minor cross-resistance to the dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase and DHFR, CB3717 (5- and 15-fold, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated that, depending upon the mechanism of resistance, MTX-resistant human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells may be effectively killed by antifolates with different routes of uptake into cells, or with a different enzyme target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, there are at least three functionally distinct classes of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
