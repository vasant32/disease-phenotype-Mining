<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition experiments of EA-rosetting suggested that Raji cells infected by HSV had a higher affinity for soluble aggregated IgG than for IgG serologically adsorbed onto erythrocytes; an opposite pattern was noted with Molt-4, a non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using radiometric and microspectrofluorometric techniques, the expression of Fc-receptors, as detected by their capacity to fix aggregated IgG, paralleled the expression of serologically detectable Fc-receptors and Ia determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to beta 2-microglobulin, both Fc-receptor and Ia antigen expression increased following Hsv <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>: this suggests a specific induction of these markers on human lymphoid cells following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504513" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HSV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a specific induction of both Fc-receptors and Ia antigens by HSV following in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of human lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
