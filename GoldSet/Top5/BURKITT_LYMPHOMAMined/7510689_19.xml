<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17941">diisopropyl fluorophosphate</z:chebi>-thrombin failed to increase [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hirudin and anti-thrombin III inhibited the thrombin-induced [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i rise in Jurkat T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A synthetic thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (TRP) of 7 residues (SFLLRNP) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i mobilization, and both <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release exclusively from internal stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40, 42, 70, 120, and 130 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a likely consequence of these events, thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF-kB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin, whereas others such as THP1, a myelomonocytic cell line, and BL2, a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross-linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation </plain></SENT>
