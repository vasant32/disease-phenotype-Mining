<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, in the chemotactic interaction between non-Hodgkin B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and lymph node stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SDF-1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in stromal cells isolated from the lymph nodes of patients with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells freshly isolated from these patients and most laboratory B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, including follicular, diffuse large, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, expressed surface CXCR4 and migrated in the presence of recombinant human SDF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chemotaxis assays revealed that CXCR4-positive (but not CXCR4-negative) B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells migrated towards lymph node stromal cells, and this migration was almost completely inhibited by the addition of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells or of anti-SDF-1 neutralizing antibody to the culture supernatant of the stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of surface CXCR4 was detected in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells which migrated towards the stromal cells but not in those which showed no migratory response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, contact between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and the stromal cells resulted in down-regulation of surface CXCR4 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that SDF-1/CXCR4 is the main chemokine system involved in the chemotactic interaction between B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and lymph node stromal cells </plain></SENT>
