<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from ascitic fluid were cultured on a human embryo fibroblast feeder layer and, after a short lag period, a cell line (DH-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) was established which, like the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, was both negative for the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) and expressed a monoclonal pattern of surface immunoglobulin (alpha lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DH-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> also possessed the Burkitt-related 8:14 chromosome translocation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metaphases analysed; no other chromosomal abnormalities were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell surface phenotype of the original biopsy cells and the cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells in early passage were investigated using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to B lineage-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These antibodies had recently been used to characterise African 'endemic' Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) biopsy cells and their derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell surface phenotype of this English EBNA negative Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsy was indistinguishable from that previously shown by biopsies of EBNA positive endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It therefore appears that both the endemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, as illustrated by this case, may be derived from the same subset of progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
