<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-expressed <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> 1 (EBER1) associates tightly with the ribosomal protein L22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the general requirements for an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> to bind L22 in a SELEX experiment, selecting <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> ligands for L22 from a randomized pool of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences by using an L22-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selected sequences <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contained a stem-loop motif similar to that of the region of EBER1 previously shown to interact with L22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were highly conserved at three positions within the stem-loop and identical to the corresponding <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in EBER1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent binding sites for L22 could be identified in EBER1, and mobility shift assays indicated that two L22 molecules can interact with EBER1 simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To search for a cellular L22 ligand, we constructed a SELEX library from cDNA fragments derived from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that was coimmunoprecipitated with L22 from an EBV-negative whole-cell lysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After four rounds of selection and amplification, most of the clones that were obtained overlapped a sequence corresponding to the stem-loop between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 302 and 317 in human 28S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This stem-loop fulfills the criteria for optimal binding to L22 that were defined by SELEX, suggesting that human 28S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> is likely to be a cellular L22 ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional L22 binding sites were found in 28S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi>, as well as within 18S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> and in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> segments not present in sequence databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The methodology described for the conversion of a preselected cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> pool into a SELEX library might be generally applicable to other proteins for the identification of cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> ligands </plain></SENT>
