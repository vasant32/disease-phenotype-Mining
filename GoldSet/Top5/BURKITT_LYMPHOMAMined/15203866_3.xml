<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The balance in the expression of pro (Fas/CD95) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) may control the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy and subsequently affect the patient's prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the levels of Bcl-2 and Fas expression on blast cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and to correlate the degree of expression to the clinical and laboratory prognostic factors and the patient's outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty newly diagnosed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (16 ALL, 24 AML) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects of matched age and sex were studied as a reference control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of Bcl-2 and Fas expression on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> blast cells were assessed before the start of therapy and on mononuclear cells after 1 year of follow up, using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of Bcl-2 and Fas expression were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (P&lt;0.01,&lt;0.05, respectively) and ALL (P&lt;0.01, &lt;0.05, respectively) as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of Fas and Bcl-2 was related to FAB type with the highest Bcl-2 and lowest Fas expression in M5 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (P&lt;0.01, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In ALL, patients responding to induction chemotherapy revealed lower Bcl-2 and higher Fas expression when compared to non-responders (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> the difference between responders and non-responders to induction chemotherapy regarding Bcl-2 and Fas expressions was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and Fas expression were significantly elevated in the relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> group (in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL) when compared to those in remission (P&lt;0.01, &lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and Fas expression at diagnosis was not significantly different when those surviving were compared to the group who had died, either in the ALL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression was significantly correlated to bone marrow blast cell counts (R=0.6, P&lt;0.01), blast cell distribution ratio (R=0.4, P&lt;0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (R=0.33, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whereas Fas expression was significantly correlated to bone marrow blast cell counts (R=0.52, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, assessment of Bcl-2 and Fas expression at diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (1) could predict responsiveness to induction chemotherapy in ALL but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group but (2) could not predict patients out come both in ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
