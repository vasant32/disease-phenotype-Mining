<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large cohort of 2028 children with ALL, we compared treatment outcomes of a subset of B-lineage ALL patients with CD10+CD19+CD34+ immature B-progenitor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (BPL) to the treatment outcomes of the remaining CD19+ B-lineage ALL patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified further into age groups of &gt; or = 1 year and &lt;12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival (EFS) outcomes were calculated by standard life table methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BPL patients in both age groups generally had more favorable presenting characteristics than non-BPL controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the age group of &gt; or = 1 year, BPL patients had a slightly better EFS outcome than non-BPL patients, with 3-year estimates of 83.9% (SD = 1.1%) vs. 78.8% (SD = 1.8%), respectively (P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infants with BPL, representing one-fifth of the total infant patient population, had a significantly better EFS outcome than infants with non-BPL (three-year EFS: 82.4%, SD = 9.2% vs. 34.4%, SD = 5.9%, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, the relative hazard rate (RHR) was 3.73 for non-BPL vs BPL and this marked difference in EFS outcome was maintained at 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The favorable prognostic influence of the BPL immunophenotype for infants remained significant in multivariate analyses with an RHR of 2.72 for non-BPL vs BPL (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD10+CD19+CD34+ immature B-progenitor immunophenotype is associated with favorable characteristics for children with ALL and identifies a subset of infants who achieve favorable EFS outcomes </plain></SENT>
