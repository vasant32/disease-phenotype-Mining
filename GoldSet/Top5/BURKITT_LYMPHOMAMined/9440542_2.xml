<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding site for nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is present at the promoter region of the germline Cepsilon gene, but there is little information on whether this factor is involved in regulating IgE synthesis by human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we studied the role of NF-kappaB in germline Cepsilon transcription by using two human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B cell lines, DND39 and DG75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cell lines, n-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17561,29950">L-cysteine</z:chebi> (NAC), a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, inhibited the triggering of the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB by IL-4 and by anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although IL-4 activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 6 in addition to NF-kappaB, NAC treatment or the transfection of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides for NF-kappaB or STAT6 only partly blocked IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these two decoy oligodeoxynucleotides together almost completely abrogated IL-4-induced germline Cepsilon transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, CD40-mediated enhancement of IL-4-driven germline Cepsilon transcription was markedly decreased by NAC or by a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide for NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of NAC was also examined on deletional switch recombination underlying the isotype switch to IgE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NAC inhibited the generation of Smu/Sepsilon switch fragments in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also abolished IL-4-induced upregulation of CD40 but promoted upregulation of CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that coordination of NF-kappaB and STAT6 may be required for induction of germline Cepsilon transcription by IL-4, and that CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation may be important in regulating both enhancement of germline Cepsilon transcription and class switching to IgE </plain></SENT>
