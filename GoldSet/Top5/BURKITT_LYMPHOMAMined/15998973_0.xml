<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BCL-6 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is highly expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal center B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its function is to prevent differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and allow growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCL-6 also is expressed in various lymphoproliferative conditions, for example, diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as well as lymphocyte predominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression also has been demonstrated in some T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, BCL-6 is involved in translocations with a number of different translocation partners but most commonly the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first intron of BCL-6 is heavily mutated, and detailed analysis reveals two "hotspots." The mutated region appears to be within a transcriptional control region, and there is the potential for alterations to contribute to overexpression of BCL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methods for <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> extraction from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples and amplification by polymerase chain reaction of the hypermutated intronic region are described </plain></SENT>
