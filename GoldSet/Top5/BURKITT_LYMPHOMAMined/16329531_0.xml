<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of PCR-based techniques have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of Southern blotting, the standard technique in detecting IgH gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an established seminested PCR technique with consensus primers to the V and J regions of the IgH gene, we analysed DNA prepared from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow specimens from 30 cases of known B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and 3 Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo>), 3 cases of T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> and 3 cases of reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> diagnosed in Hospital UKM to detect rearranged IgH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that monoclonality as represented by the presence of rearranged IgH gene were demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCR findings showed 100% concordance with the Southern blot analysis results which also showed rearranged IgH bands in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that none of the cases of T <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> showed presence of rearranged IgH band, suggesting that the amplification using the IgH primers is lineage-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we find the PCR a useful method to detect IgH gene rearrangement in peripheral blood and bone marrow specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the PCR results are comparable to that of the Southern blotting in demonstrating B cell monoclonality and owing to its many advantages we feel that it can replace the Southern blot technique for the diagnosis of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
