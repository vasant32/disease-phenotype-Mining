<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unwindase activity is very low in mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells arrested into quiescence, but increases when the cells are released into renewed growth by serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a gel retardation assay proved to be specific and sensitive for detection of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> duplex-unwindase complexes </plain></SENT>
