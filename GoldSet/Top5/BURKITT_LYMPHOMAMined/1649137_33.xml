<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the EBV transactivators, the ZEBRA protein plays a crucial role in switching the virus from a latent to a productive mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ZEBRA protein was produced using a eukaryotic expression vector: the open reading frame containing the BZFLI cDNA has previously been inserted down-stream from the adenovirus major late promoter leading to expression of a 38-kDa nuclear protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed serological studies by employing ZEBRA protein expressed in human cells for immunofluorescence and Western-blot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to detect IgG anti-ZEBRA antibodies (IgG/ZEBRA) in 87% of NPC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These antibodies were absent in control sera; IgG/ZEBRA antibodies can be proposed as a useful marker for diagnosis of NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
