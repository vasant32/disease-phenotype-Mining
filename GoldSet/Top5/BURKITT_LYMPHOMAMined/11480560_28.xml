<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique is not very complex, but discordancies are frequently observed between laboratories, due to the lack of standardized methodological procedures and technical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To develop standardized flow cytometric techniques for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> detection, a European BIOMED-1 Concerted Action was initiated with the participation of laboratories from six different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this concerted action was to define aberrant phenotypic profiles in a series of 264 consecutive de novo precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases, systematically studied with one to five triple-labelings (TdT/CD10/CD19, CD10/CD20/CD19, CD34/CD38/CD19, CD34/CD22/CD19 and CD19/CD34/CD45) using common flow cytometric protocols in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participating laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of four or five triple-stainings allowed the identification of aberrant phenotypes in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases tested (127 out of 130, 98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic aberrancies could be identified in at least two and often three triple-labelings per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the analysis was based on two or three triple-stainings, lower incidences of aberrancies were identified (75% and 81% of cases, respectively) that could be detected in one and sometimes two triple-stainings per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most informative triple staining was the TdT/CD10/CD19 combination, which enabled the identification of aberrancies in 78% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of phenotypic aberrations detected with the other four triple-stainings were 64% for CD10/CD20/CD19, 56% for CD34/CD38/CD19, 46% for CD34/CD22/CD19, and 22% for CD19/CD34/CD45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, cross-lineage antigen expression was detected in 45% of cases, mainly coexpression of the myeloid antigens CD13 and/or CD33 (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parallel flow cytometric studies in different laboratories finally resulted in highly concordant results (&gt;90%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five antibody combinations, indicating the high reproducibility of our approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the technique presented here with triple-labelings forms an excellent basis for standardized flow cytometric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> studies in multicenter international treatment protocols for precursor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
