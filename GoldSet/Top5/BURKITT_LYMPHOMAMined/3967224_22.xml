<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines bear one or more of a group of markers, including common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen gp26 (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with a molecular weight of 26,000), B1, surface membrane immunoglobulin, HLA, beta 2-microglobulin, and Ia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combinations of two monoclonal antibodies were more effective than any single antibody in eliminating Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of three monoclonal reagents was no more effective than a combination of J2 and B1 or J2 and J5 in eliminating Namalwa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of human bone marrow with three antibodies and RC did not, however, produce a selective loss of nonmalignant GM-CFU-C, CFU-E, or BFU-E </plain></SENT>
