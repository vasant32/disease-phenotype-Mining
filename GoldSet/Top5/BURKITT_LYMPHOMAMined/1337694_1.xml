<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The kidneys of non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients frequently contain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, but these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> rarely arise in the renal tissue and are rarely located there </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A diagnosis of non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of renal origin or predominantly located in kidneys was made in 7 patients aged 2-14 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients formed part of a total of 450 patients with non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> seen from 1974 to 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first manifestation in these 7 children was an abdominal mass associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 3 cases; 2 of whom presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography showed hypoechogenous masses in one (2 cases) or both kidneys (5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was made directly in only one patient who also presented with mediastinal and abdominal lymph node enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the others, the first diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> (5 cases) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_586'>polycystic disease</z:mpath> of the kidney (1 case); the correct diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was later made from biopsies of renal (4 patients) or extrarenal involved tissue (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 7 cases were Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 were in stage III (3 patients) and IV (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>6 patients (3 stage III and 3 stage IV) were successfully treated by chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis between non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of renal origin and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> may be difficult even though <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp> is more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sonography is the best method for diagnosis showing typical hypoechogenous masses and diffuse homogeneous infiltration of the kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of extrarenal (meningeal, testis, bone marrow) dissemination, definite evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> depends on the histological examination of tumoral tissue obtained by surgical biopsy </plain></SENT>
