<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed the exploration of more dose-intensive therapy such as autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in selected patients with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report on the use of myeloablative chemotherapy with ASCT in two HIV positive patients with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient underwent ASCT at the time of first disease remission for poor risk, diffuse, large cell NHL and the second patient had multiply recurrent, chemosensitive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASCT was performed in both patients using a transplant conditioning regimen of high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3423">carmustine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (CBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The target dose of &gt;/= 5 x 10(6)/kg CD34 positive peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) utilized for ASCT was collected using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) after chemotherapy for mobilization while both patients were receiving concomitant HAART for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HAART was continued during CBV conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prompt hematopoietic recovery was observed after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients remained in clinical disease remission from their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at 28 months and 20 months after transplant, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ASCT is feasible in patients with HIV-associated NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate numbers of CD34 positive PBSC can be procured from patients receiving HAART and chemotherapy for NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with HIV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can tolerate the high dose CBV myeloablative chemotherapy regimen without increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> regimen-related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reinfusion of G-CSF-mobilized PBSC can lead to rapid recovery of hematologic function and sustained engraftment after ASCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given the poor prognosis of patients with HIV-associated NHL treated with conventional chemotherapy, further investigation of this approach should be considered </plain></SENT>
