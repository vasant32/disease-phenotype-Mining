<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 97.2% could be assigned clearly to myeloid or lymphoid lineage (254 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>], 48 B-cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> [ALLs], 14 T-cell lineage ALLs), 1.8% as biphenotypic, and less than 1% as undifferentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunologic subtyping of ALLs revealed an association between early precursor phenotypes and coexpression of myeloid antigens, particularly CD15/CD65s coexpression and pre-pre-B cell-specific phenotypes and genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> phenotype was associated with BCR-ABL translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, CD2 coexpression was almost exclusively restricted to French-American-British subtypes M3 variant and M4Eo and related molecular aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most valuable markers to differentiate between myeloperoxidase-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtypes M0 and ALLs were CD13, CD33, and CD117, typical of M0, and intracytoplasmic CD79a, intracytoplasmic CD3, CD10, and CD2, typical of B cell- or T cell-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm excellent practicability of the EGIL proposalfor immunologic classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For myeloperoxidase-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, we suggest a scoring system based on markers most valuable to distinguish between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>-M0 and ALLs </plain></SENT>
