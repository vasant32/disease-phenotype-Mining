<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated to the etio-pathogenesis of an increasing number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of EBV in pathology samples is relevant since its high prevalence in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> makes the virus a promising target of specific therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization (RISH) is the standard diagnostic procedure, while polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are used for strain (EBV type-1 or 2) distinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic comparison between RISH and PCR for EBV detection, in a group of childhood B-cell Non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL), aiming to validate PCR as a first, rapid method for the diagnosis of EBV-associated B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was investigated in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples of 41 children with B-cell NHL, including 35 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER-RISH) and PCR assays based on EBNA2 amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV genomes were detected in 68% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Type 1 and 2 accounted for 80% and 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR and RISH were highly concordant (95%), as well as single- and nested-PCR results, allowing the use of a single PCR round for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR assays showed a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 100%, respectively, with a detection level of 1 EBV genome in 5,000-10,000 EBV-negative cells, excluding the possibility of detecting low-number EBV-bearing memory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe adequate PCR conditions with similar sensitivity and reliability to RISH, to be used for EBV diagnostic screening in high grade B-NHL, in "at risk" geographic regions </plain></SENT>
