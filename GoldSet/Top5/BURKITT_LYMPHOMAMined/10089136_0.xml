<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were interested in studying the molecular and ultrastructural events occurring when the nucleus is more accessible and cells are blocked in mitosis, following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, as early as after 1 h treatment a typical ladder pattern was shown by means of DNA gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel the quantitative analysis of the different morphological patterns observed gave evidence of an increased percentage of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after 6 h treatment, and a higher incidence of cells in late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as well as in secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after 24 h treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that Daudi cells respond to the combined treatment with an increased formation of micronuclei and nuclear alterations which follow a number of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes and result in enhanced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data imply that TNF-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells can be triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> changes and is somehow related to microtubule organization </plain></SENT>
