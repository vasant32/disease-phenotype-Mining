<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The observation that 3-aminobenzamide, which inhibits a variety of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> transferases, prolongs the gamma-irradiation-induced increase in intracellular p53 concentration suggested that one or more of such enzymes may determine the duration of the p53 response during G1 arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP), an abundant nuclear enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks, in the p53 response to y-irradiation was investigated in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> AG876 cells stably transfected with an inducible PARP antisense construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis revealed that the cellular content of PARP was reduced to virtually undetectable levels after incubation of transfected cells for 72 h with the inducer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In noninduced antisense cells, the p53 concentration reached a maximum 2 h after exposure to 6.3 Gy of gamma-radiation and returned to control values by 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the p53 response in PARP-depleted antisense cells peaked at 4 h, with the levels of p53 remaining elevated for up to 12 h after y-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal increase in p53 concentration was similar in both induced and noninduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results thus indicate that PARP activity, in part, determines the duration, but not the magnitude, of the p53 response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
