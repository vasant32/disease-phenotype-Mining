<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aberrant localization of beta-catenin in nucleus causes the transcription of down-stream target genes, which is the pathogenesy of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the expression of adheren junction on hemopoietic cells is very low, there are a few studies on beta-catenin expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate beta-catenin localization and beta-catenin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines so as to explore a new oncogenic mechanism and to find out a new therapeutic target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beta-catenin localization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines was detected by immunocytochemistry, the beta-catenin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level was assayed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was aberrant localization of beta-catenin in Jurkat and Thp-1, and beta-catenin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level was not increased in these two cell lines, however, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of Jurkat and Thp-1 were lower than those of Daudi and K562 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beta-catenin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression level was not correlated with beta-catenin aberrant localization in these 4 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the aberrant localization of beta-catenin may play a role in the development of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and the mechanism resulting in beta-catenin aberrant localization not take place at transcription level </plain></SENT>
