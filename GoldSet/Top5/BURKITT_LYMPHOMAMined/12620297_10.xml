<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and in the four serum-free media X-vivo 10, X-vivo 15, X-vivo 20 and Stem Span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Native ALL blasts could proliferate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four serum-free media, but the strongest responses were usually observed with Stem Span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Native <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts were also cultured in the presence of various single cytokines or cytokine combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest proliferation was usually observed in the presence of Flt3-Ligand (Flt3-L) when single cytokines were examined, and these responses could be further increased especially by combining Flt3-L with interleukin 3 (IL3), IL7 or stem cell factor (SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation could also be increased when ALL blasts were cultured in the presence of two commercially available fibroblast cell lines (Hs27 and HFL1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these results we suggest that in vitro culture conditions for native human ALL blasts can be standardized by using serum-free culture media supplemented with exogenous Flt3-L+IL3+SCF, and the use of accessory cells can also be standardized by using well-characterized fibroblast cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detectable ALL blast proliferation can then be observed for most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experimental model can thereby be used for in vitro evaluation of possible antileukemic treatment strategies, and it will then allow comparison of experimental results between different studies </plain></SENT>
