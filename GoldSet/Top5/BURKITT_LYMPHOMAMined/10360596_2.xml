<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posttransplantation Epstein-Barr virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLPD) occurs as a spectrum of disease ranging from benign, polyclonal, localized <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> to malignant, monoclonal, disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, sometimes involving the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, PTLPD has not been previously reported to present as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the case of a boy who developed PTLPD in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> 6 years after cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had greater than 90% bone marrow invasion by Epstein-Barr virus-positive B lymphoblasts with Burkitt-like features and a t(8;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: He was successfully treated with combination chemotherapy but unfortunately died, 6 months after completing treatment, from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> may occur as a manifestation of PTLPD and should be included in the classification of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination should be an essential part of the investigation of patients suspected of having PTLPD </plain></SENT>
