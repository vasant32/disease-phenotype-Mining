<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize the temporal relationship of RAG-1 expression to other markers of human B-lymphoid differentiation [cell surface antigens, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), Ig gene rearrangements], RAG-1 expression was studied in a group of B lineage childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ALL cells from 21 patients were grouped into three developmentally related phenotypes based on the expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD10, and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were surface Ig (slg) negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> representing each developmental stage of Ig gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RAG-1 was expressed in 20 of 21 B-lineage ALL, including leukemic cells from each stage of differentiation, as defined by immunophenotype and IgH and IgL gene rearrangement status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RAG-1 was expressed in slg- ALL, regardless of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) or Ig light chain (IgL) gene configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RAG-1 was not expressed in two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with slg+ mature B-lymphocyte phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases, RAG-1 was expressed in TdT-negative ALL; conversely TdT was expressed in the one RAG-1 negative ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that RAG-1 in B-lineage ALL is expressed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phenotypic and genotypic developmental stages preceding surface immunoglobulin expression, and that TdT and RAG-1 may be regulated by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
