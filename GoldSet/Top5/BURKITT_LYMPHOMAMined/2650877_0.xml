<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of c-myc and c-Ha-ras oncogenes in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daudi lymphoblastoid cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human leukocytes served as a positive and a negative control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Northern blot analysis using a c-myc probe revealed a 2.7 kb transcript and two larger transcripts greater than 23 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Northern blot hybridization using a c-Ha-ras probe, two transcripts with sizes of 1.8 and 6.1 kb were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affinity of the Namalva <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization to c-myc probe was about 10-fold lower than that in Daudi <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, whereas no difference in the c-Ha-ras hybridization was observed between the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that c-myc and c-Ha-ras are expressed in Namalva cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy to consider that the difference in oncogene expression between Namalva and Daudi cells might be due to the difference in interferon properties between the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
