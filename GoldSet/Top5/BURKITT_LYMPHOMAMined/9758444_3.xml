<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured the serum levels of PTHrP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of PTHrP, LDH and calcium were elevated at admission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and these levels were reduced to within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, normalization of serum PTHrP concentration occurred more rapidly than normalization of serum LDH levels after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in serum PTHrP concentration accompanied leukemic cell proliferation and preceded the increases in serum LDH and calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum LDH concentration increased, but serum PTHrP concentration did not after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that serum PTHrP may be a more useful marker than serum LDH or calcium in assessing the status of leukemic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
