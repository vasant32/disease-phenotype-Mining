<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subsequently developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subsequently developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with synchronous B-cell and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were three men and two women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age at the initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was 66 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the development of the two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was 83 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients died of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean survival was 96 months after the initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 14 months after the diagnosis of the histologically discordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was found in two cases--the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the patient who presented with synchronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and the subsequent T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in one of the patients who presented with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of immunophenotypic and genotypic analyses, these cases likely represent the occurrence of two distinct lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> rather than histologic progression of the same neoplastic clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a subset of these cases are Epstein-Barr virus-associated </plain></SENT>
