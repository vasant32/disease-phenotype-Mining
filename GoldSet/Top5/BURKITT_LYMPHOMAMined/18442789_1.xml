<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified a novel <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> specifically targeting a human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Raji, through a conventional phage display method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence, 'CTLPHLKMC' was obtained with the highest frequency from a nonapeptide-expressing phage library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phage clone encoding CTLPHLKMC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence avidly bound to Raji cells compared with control phage clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, flow-cytometric analysis on the biotinylated synthetic CTLPHLKMC <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> demonstrated the high binding affinity to Raji cells in a dose-dependent manner whereas it has binding activity to neither human peripheral blood mononuclear cells including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell derived from healthy donors nor other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, Jurkat and IM-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry following immunoprecipitation assay showed that a potential host receptor for the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is a variable region of human immunoglobulin heavy chain which would be a specific phenotypic marker of Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, 'CTLPHLKMC', is a specific ligand to a Raji cell </plain></SENT>
