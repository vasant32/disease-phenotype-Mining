<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of adult patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the United States are over age 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Older patients have historically been underrepresented in published clinical trials of modern intensive therapy, and the outcome of these patients has not been systematically reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore obtained and analyzed primary data from 14 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treatment series and confirmed that older patients (age &gt; 40 years) are underrepresented in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Historically inferior outcomes of this age subgroup have improved substantially over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that (1) modern intensive chemotherapy regimens should remain the standard of care for patients &gt; age 40 with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; (2) selected patients &gt; age 40 now have highly favorable outcomes; and (3) future studies should include formal analysis of this subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
