<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1980, significant differences in survival of children with disseminated disease correlated with histologic diagnosis and the randomized treatment employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pathology reproducibility review showed the lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases to be virtually 100 per cent distinguishable histologically from the nonlymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (Burkitt's, non-Burkitt's, and "histiocytic") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, diagnostic reproducibility of the pathologist-of-record was 59 per cent in the Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 159 cases, agreed on by the pathologist-of-record and the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> panel" as Burkitt's (77 cases) or non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (82 cases) and designated as the "reference diagnosis," were blindly reviewed twice each by two hematopathologists to yield the "review diagnoses." Consensus agreement was achieved in 67 per cent of cases overall, 82 per cent of Burkitt's and 54 per cent of non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the "reference diagnoses," we found that the relative frequency of Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was associated with the extent of disease at diagnosis (P = 0.06) but not with other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the difficulties in histologic classification, analyses that used either "reference diagnoses" or "consensus review diagnoses" and that were adjusted for extent of disease consistently demonstrated significantly shorter event-free survival for patients having Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; their failure rate was four times that for patient's with non-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Newer cell biologic techniques hopefully will enhance histopathologic distinctions that remain the basis for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
