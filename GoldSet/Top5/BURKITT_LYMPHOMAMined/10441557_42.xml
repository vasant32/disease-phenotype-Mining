<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, EBV DNA sequence was determined from 92 tissue specimens or cell lines, including nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral hairy leukoplakia</z:e>, post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, post-transplant without pathology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030581" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">parotid tumor</z:e>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> from distinct geographical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences and, in some cases, the full-length sequences of latent membrane protein 1 were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristic sequence patterns distinguished strains, with the carboxyl-terminal sequence being the most informative in distinguishing among the strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic relationships between strains were determined, as were signature amino acid changes that discriminate between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correlation between strain and disease or strain and geographic location was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence variation and signature sequences identified at least seven distinct strains, as well as hybrid strains that apparently result from recombination </plain></SENT>
