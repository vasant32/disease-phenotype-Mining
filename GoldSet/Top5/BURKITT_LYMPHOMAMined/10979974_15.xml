<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (BCP-ALLs) are increasingly treated on risk-adapted protocols based on presenting clinical and biological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Residual molecular positivity of clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements allows detection of patients at an increased risk of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If these rearrangements are to be used for universal follow-up, it is important to determine the extent to which they are informative in different BCP-ALL subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that IGH V-D-J rearrangements occur in 89% of 163 BCP-ALL, with no significant variation according to age or genotype (BCR-ABL, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1, MLL-AF4, and E2A-PBX1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TCRG rearrangements, which occur in 60% of patients overall, are frequent in BCR-ABL and <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1, are less so in MLL-AF4, and are virtually absent in infants aged predominantly from 1 to 2 years and in E2A-PBX1 ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of the predominant TCRD Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement decreases with age but is independent of genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences are not due to differential recombination activating gene activity, nor can they be explained adequately by stage of maturation arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of MLL-AF4 BCP-ALL is in keeping with transformation of a precursor at an early stage of ontogenic development, despite the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> of the cases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the complete absence of TCRG rearrangement in E2A-PBX1 cases may result from deregulated E2A function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data also have practical consequences for the use of TCR clonality for the molecular follow-up of BCP-ALL </plain></SENT>
