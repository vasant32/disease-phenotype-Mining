<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV promotes its effects through the activation of multiple signaling pathways, with NF-κB mediated transcription being a major target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have undertaken a comparative proteomic approach using 2D-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify EBV-regulated proteins in the BL41 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of the proteins differentially regulated were previously known mediators of EBV action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the novel proteins identified, three members of the conserved COMMD family were found to be down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of this family at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, using reverse-transcriptase or real-time PCR, showed that 7 out of 10 COMMD members were affected in EBV-transformed BL41 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since COMMD family proteins have been implicated as negative regulators of the NF-κB transcription factor, our data are consistent with a hypothesis that EBV down-regulates COMMD proteins in order to enhance NF-κB mediated transcriptional events and B-lymphocyte transformation </plain></SENT>
