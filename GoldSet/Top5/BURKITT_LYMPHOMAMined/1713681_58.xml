<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human B lymphocytes in vitro results in the expression of six <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and three <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, examination of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression in fresh Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> isolates has revealed expression of only one of the nuclear antigens, EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous transcriptional analyses of the EBNA-encoding genes demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these genes are driven from one of two distal promoters located near the left end of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, raising the question of how exclusive expression of EBNA-1 occurs in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most established Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (group 3) exhibit the full-expression pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens seen in lymphoblastoid cell lines, a few cell lines have been established that retain the restricted pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper we characterize transcription of the EBNA-1 gene in a group 1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line and show that (i) neither Cp nor Wp, the promoters involved in driving EBNA gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines, are active in this cell line; (ii) treatment of this cell line with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>, previously shown to induce expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBNA genes, induced Cp and Wp activity; (iii) sizes of the EBNA-1 transcripts detected in two group 1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines correlated with each other and were distinct from the size of the EBNA-1 transcript seen in lymphoblastoid cell lines; (iv) the EBNA-1 transcripts in the group 1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines do not hybridize to a probe containing the common 5' exons present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the EBNA transcripts from lymphoblastoid cell lines; and (v) anchored-PCR cloning the 5' region of the EBNA-1 transcript from one of the group 1 cell lines identified two exons, FQ and U, upstream of the EBNA-1 coding exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FQ exon lies just downstream of a TATAA box, which may represent the promoter for transcription of EBNA-1 in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is particularly noteworthy that an incomplete EBNA-1 cDNA clone from a nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> line that expresses EBNA-1, but not the other EBNAs, has been characterized; this EBNA-1 transcript also contains the FQ/U splice junction, suggesting that the organization of exons upstream of the EBNA-1 coding exon is the same and that this organization may reflect a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> program for exclusive EBNA-1 expression </plain></SENT>
