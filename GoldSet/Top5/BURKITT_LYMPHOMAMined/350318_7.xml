<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 9% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes an almost continuous, strong labeling of the cell membrane was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of these lymphocytes were characterized by a peculiar uniform fine structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-labeled monocytes was in the range of 25%, neutrophils nearly 100%, eosinophils 0%, CLL-cells 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Labeled portions of the membrane were interiorized from monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lymphoid cell-line Daudi established from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appeared almost negative, the cell line K562 established from a myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in 75% of the cells strongly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-labeling was not influenced by preincubation with trypsine or with neuraminidase; it was negative when <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-F(ab)2 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-labeling were not always in agreement with EA-rosettes or with agg-Ig </plain></SENT>
