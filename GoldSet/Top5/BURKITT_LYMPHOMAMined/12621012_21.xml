<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared the immunoscintigraphy, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy of pretargeted RIT with conventional RIT using an anti-CD20 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Athymic mice bearing Ramos human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografts were injected intraperitoneally with a 1F5-sAv conjugate followed 24 h later by a galactosylated, biotinylated clearing agent (CA) and, finally, 3 h later by (111)In- or (90)Y-labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37391">1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane</z:chebi>-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparison groups consisted of mice injected with conventional, directly labeled (111)In- or (90)Y-1F5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rapid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake of radioactivity within 2 h was observed with the pretargeting approach, resulting in high-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> images at 24 h with minimal blood-pool radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although conventional radiolabeled antibodies produced clear <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> images at 24 h, a large amount of radioactivity was present in the blood pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-blood ratio was 3.5:1 with pretargeting compared with 0.4:1 with conventional (111)In-1F5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretargeted RIT with 29.6 MBq (800 micro Ci) (90)Y-DOTA-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> cured 100% of mice with tolerable toxicity, whereas conventional RIT with (90)Y-1F5 at a dose of 14.8 MBq (400 micro Ci) produced no cures, induced profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and was lethal to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that anti-CD20 pretargeted RIT may be superior to conventional radiolabeled antibodies in terms of radioimmunoscintigraphy, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy for treatment of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
