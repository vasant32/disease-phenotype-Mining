<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD54 was identified in 6 of 15 fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations of p53 gene, analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded chain polymorphism followed by sequencing, were found in 5 of 14 cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases with p53 mutation were CD54 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This high frequency of p53 mutation in the CD54 negative group prompted us to analyze the clinical features of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 15 cases died within 21 months after initiation of therapy and five of these were CD54 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, four of these had p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the lack of CD54 by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells may provide the background for the mutation of p53 gene to occur which could result in the transformation to a more aggressive phenotype </plain></SENT>
