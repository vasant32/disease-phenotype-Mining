<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although elevated antibody levels to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been reported in a number of lympho-proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, it has not been possible to determine whether these antibodies were the result of a specific response to an oncogenic agent (EBV), whether they were a non-specific humoral compensation for depressed cell-mediated immunity (CMI), or whether a different mechanism was responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown in a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients that depressed cellular immunity to a number of standard antigens (Candida, SKSD, etc.) is not associated with an increase in antibody to EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tried to compare CMI to possible EBV and lymphoid cell line antigens with humoral antibody to EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two basis CMI assays utilized were lymphocyte cytotoxicity (LC) and skin testing (ST) for delayed hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the LC assay, an EBV-containing cell line (F265) was used as the target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity against F265 was stronger in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, suggesting a relationship to general cellular immune competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ST studies showed that membrane extracts from lymphoid cell lines derived from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) were more likely to elicit a delayed hypersensitivity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and NPC patients than cell lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ST reactivity against the membrane preparations from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-derived cell lines were as likely to have elevated EBV antibodies as patients without such reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data strongly indicated that the elevated EBV titres in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients are not related to a specific or non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of CMI </plain></SENT>
