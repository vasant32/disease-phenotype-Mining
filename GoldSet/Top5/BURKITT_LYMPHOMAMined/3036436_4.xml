<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites of hybridization were associated with the chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only some of these sites were present on both chromatids and these had a non-random distribution; these sites could represent EBV sequences integrated at specific points on the chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total mean site number corresponded with the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA copies estimated in the different cell lines by other techniques, but the copy number was highly variable from cell to cell in a given line </plain></SENT>
