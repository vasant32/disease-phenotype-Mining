<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal breakpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) cells of the B-cell type carrying the translocated long arms of chromosomes 11 and 14 [t(11;14) (q13;q32)] was cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint was found to be within the joining segment of the human heavy chain locus on the translocated long arm of chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A probe that is specific for chromosome 11 and that maps immediately 5' to the breakpoint on the 14q+ chromosome was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probe detected a rearrangement of the homologous genomic DNA segment in the parental CLL cells and also in DNA from a diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with the t(11;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This rearranged DNA segment was not present in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with the t(8;14) translocation or in nonneoplastic human lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probe can thus be used to identify and characterize a gene located on band q13 of chromosome 11 that appears to be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of human B cells carrying the t(11;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This gene, named bcl -1, appears to be unrelated to any of the known retrovirus oncogenes described to date </plain></SENT>
