<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microarray experiments involve many steps, including spotting cDNA, extracting <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, labeling targets, hybridizing, scanning, and analyzing images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each step introduces variability, confounding our ability to obtain accurate estimates of the biological differences between samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We ran repeated experiments using high-density cDNA microarray membranes (Research Genetics Human GeneFilters Microarrays Version I) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37973">33P</z:chebi>-labeled targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (GA-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the components of variation coming from: (1) image analysis, (2) exposure time to PhosphorImager screens, (3) differences in membranes, (4) reuse of membranes, and (5) differences in targets prepared from two independent <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Variation was assessed qualitatively using a clustering algorithm and quantitatively using a version of ANOVA adapted to multivariate microarray data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest contribution to variation came from reusing membranes, which contributed 38% of the total variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in membranes and in exposure time each contributed about 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in target preparations contributed less than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of image quantification was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Much of the effect from reusing membranes was attributable to increasing levels of background radiation and can be reduced by using membranes at most four times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects of exposure time, which were partly attributable to variation in the scanning process, can be minimized by using the same exposure time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments </plain></SENT>
