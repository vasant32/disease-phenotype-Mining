<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a t(8;14) (q24;q32) translocation involving the c-myc protooncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The VH genes were derived from VH1, VH3 and VH4, and both the IgM-positive (four cases) and IgG-positive (two cases) were extensively mutated from germline sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases, early and late passage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were available, and the VH nucleotide sequences were identical, indicating that mutations had not accumulated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a further case, there was evidence of sequence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, which appeared to have been generated in vivo, indicating that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell VH gene was able to undergo posttranslocation somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the relatively nonpolymorphic VH4 genes for the pattern of replacement or silent mutations did not show a role for antigen selection in the expressed sequences </plain></SENT>
