<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines can be induced to enter the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> lytic cycle and initiate replication by stimulating surface immunoglobulin molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this process many EBV genes are expressed that have the potential to influence host gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify host genes that are regulated by EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and those that are regulated following ligation of surface IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The differentially expressed genes in EBV-positive Akata cells and EBV-negative AK31 cells were detected by microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 91 human genes were differentially expressed between Akata and AK31 cells and 198 were differentially expressed when cells were stimulated to enter lytic replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differential expression of one gene, myd88, was correlated with disrupted TLR9 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EBV down-regulates most of the genes regulated by surface Ig cross-linking in the early stages of lytic cycle activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These include genes involved in cell survival, signal transduction, transcription control and the immune response that may mediate EBV transformation of B-lymphocytes and others such as HDAC4 that may affect virus replication </plain></SENT>
