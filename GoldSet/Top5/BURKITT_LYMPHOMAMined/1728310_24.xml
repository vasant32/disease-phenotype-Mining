<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple VHDJH joinings in upwards of 30% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) suggests a relative instability of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene, but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An investigation of the structure of the VHDJH joinings using complementarity determining region (CDR)3 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> at both diagnosis and relapse indicates that this instability may increase as a function of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In only one of seven cases in which relapse occurred within 3 years from diagnosis was a new VHDJH joining identified and this coexisted with the original diagnostic joining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most strikingly, new VHDJH joinings were identified in four of five cases in which relapse occurred more than 5 years from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this latter population, the instability of the joinings was generated from VH----VH gene replacement events in two cases, since the new joinings retained the original DJH sequences and partial N region homology at the VHD junction, and probably in a third case from a VH gene rearrangement to a common DJH precursor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in five of 23 (21.7%) additional cases studied at diagnosis, subclones were identified that had similar modifications of the VH-N region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that VH gene replacement events and VH gene rearrangements to a common DJH joining contribute to the instability of the VHDJH joining in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon should be taken into consideration in those methodologies that exploit IgH rearrangements for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
