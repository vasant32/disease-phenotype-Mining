<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We attempted to identify the minimal residual leukemic clone as related to the clinical course in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from stored bone marrow slides, and the third complementarity determining region (CDRIII) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers with consensus sequences for VH and JH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After amplification of the CDRIII band, the DNA fragment of CDRIII was inserted into the cloning vector PUC118 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After cloning, the DNA sequences for CDRIII were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonospecific DNA sequences in CDRIII were selected, and clonospecific primers for each patient were synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the clonospecific primers, we carried out second-round PCR to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) during several stages of the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basically, the sensitivity of detection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was between 10(-4) and 10(-5) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even when leukemic cells were not detected in the morphologic study, with this detection system, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was identified as an amplified CDRIII band stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4883">ethidium bromide</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After bone marrow transplantation (BMT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was detected for at least 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this article, we discuss the difference in sensitivity of detection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> between the BCR-ABL fusion gene and CDRIII in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome-positive</z:e> (Ph+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, as well as the possible clinical application of this method to predict relapse and prognosis </plain></SENT>
