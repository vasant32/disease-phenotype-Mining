<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the mechanism of this deficiency, we have compared group-I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, their sub-lines which have progressed in vitro towards an LCL-like phenotype (group-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>), and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), for their ability to bind and process <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid (TT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The uptake and internalization of 125I-labelled TT was equivalent in the 3 cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only LCLs and group-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were able to process the TT, as shown by the identification of discrete proteolytic products after separation of whole-cell extracts in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39063">tricine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels, and by the recovery of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-soluble radioactivity in the culture supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Processing of TT was induced by expression of the EBV-encoded membrane protein LMP 1 in transfected group-1 BLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that the inability of group-1 BLs to act as APC is due to their failure to process exogenous antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This function appears to be related to phenotypic properties that can be modulated by the expression of LMP1 </plain></SENT>
