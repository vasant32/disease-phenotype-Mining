<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the potential synergistic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine-123</z:chebi> (Rh-123) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52129">merocyanine-540</z:chebi> (MC-540) sensitization of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines after laser exposure were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a first series of experiments, the kinetics of uptake of Rh-123 and M-540 were tested on three human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines (K562, RAJI, 729HF2), P3 squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and M26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a clear difference in the rate and amount of uptake of MC-540 (K562 &gt; P3 &gt; RAJI &gt; 729HF2 &gt; M26) and Rh-123 (P3 &gt; RAJI &gt; 729HF2 &gt; K562 &gt; M26) by these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second series of experiments, M26 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were sensitized with either Rh-123 (1 microgram/ml) or with MC-540 (20 micrograms/ml) alone or with a combination of the two dyes for 60 minutes, then exposed to the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> (514.5 nm) laser at nonthermal energy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement of the tumoricidal effects of the laser on M26 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells after sensitization with both dyes together (MC-540 and Rh-123) when compared to each dye alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As with combination antibiotherapy, the synergistic effects of two laser dyes that have different intracellular targeting sites appear to enhance tumoricidal effects significantly after exposure to a matching laser wavelength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data provide evidence for effective laser phototherapy by dye synergy </plain></SENT>
