<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the genotypes of EBV in tissues from 13 NPC patients in Japan were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using EBV genome fragment probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of the cases contained reiterated sequences (EBV BamHI-H, -B1*, -K fragments), showing that only one genotype was detected in each specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these had a BamHI fragment containing a fused sequence of BamHI-Y and -H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one case, a single-sized EBV-joined terminus was observed in each NPC specimen, implying evolution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> from a single EBV-infected cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One metastatic lymph node (which was not a primary epipharyngeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) contained EBV with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> termini suggesting production of linear virion DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The type C variant resulting from loss of a BamHI site between the BamHI-W1* and -I1* regions was observed in 7 of the 10 cases, and the other 3 cases had a separated BamHI-I1* fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As reported by Lung et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(Virology, 177: 44-53, 1990), the type C variant appears to be dominant among Japanese strains, as it is in Southern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to their findings, however, the "f" variant with an extra BamHI site in the BamHI-F region which they found to be strongly associated with NPC specimens from Southern China, was detected in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study, therefore, did not support the specific association of the "f" variant with NPC in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the EBV in NPC tissues exists in variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies along these lines, could help to explain the epidemiology of EBV </plain></SENT>
