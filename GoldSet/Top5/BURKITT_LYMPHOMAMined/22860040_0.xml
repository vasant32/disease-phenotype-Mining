<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since azaphenylalanine-based compounds manifest cytotoxic activity, we have selected serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> designed and synthesized in-house with large hydrophobic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="16482">naphthalene</z:chebi> moiety for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic potential of screened molecules was correlated to modifications of R(1) residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most cytotoxic were compounds with greater basicity; amidinopiperidines, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18049">piperidines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41033">benzamidines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amidinopiperidine-based compounds exert cytotoxicity in low µM range, with IC(50) 18 µM and 22 µM for inhibitors 15 and 16 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity towards the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells Ramos and Daudi, and proved nontoxic to PMBC, Jurkat and U937 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They induce caspase-dependent apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, as demonstrated by the use of a pan-caspase inihibitor, zVADfmk, which was able to rescue Ramos cells from compound(s)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirm a disruption of the pro-survival pathway in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> through NFκB inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of phosphorylated precursor (p105) and inhibitory (IκB) molecules with no subsequent release of active NFκB implicated the involvement of proteasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we show that the amidinopiperidine-based compounds inhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three proteolytical activities of the human 20S proteasome, with the most prominent effect being on the trypsin-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consistently, treatment of Ramos cells with these compounds led to an increase in ubiquitinated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The amidinopiperidine-based serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> presented are, as selective inducers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, promising leads for the development of novel chemotherapeutics </plain></SENT>
