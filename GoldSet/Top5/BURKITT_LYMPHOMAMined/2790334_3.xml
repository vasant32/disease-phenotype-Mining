<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of a novel monosized and magnetizable polymer bead, denoted M-280, in immunomagnetic removal of Rael B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was compared with that of M-450 beads, previously used in bone marrow purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The M-280 beads which are smaller (diameter 2.8 microns) and contain less iron than the M-450 beads were coated with polyclonal IgG sheep antimouse (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two types of immunobeads were equally efficacious when used together with the mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies HH1 or FN1, giving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletions</z:mpath> of about 3 logs in one cycle of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when used together with the primary IgM monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) AB1 or HH2, the new immunobeads were significantly more efficacious than the M-450 immunobeads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the underlying mechanism flow cytometric studies and measurements of the binding of the labeled primary MoAbs to the cellular antigens as well as to the immunobeads were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Competition experiments showed that in the case of IgG MoAbs, the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> beads bind predominantly to the Fc portion, whereas in the case of the IgM MoAbs, the Fab part plays a relatively greater role in the binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that if M-280 immunobeads are used, IgM MoAbs may profitably be included in antibody cocktails together with IgG antibodies in immunomagnetic purging of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They suggest that in the case of cell bound MoAbs, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on IgG are more accessible to <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> beads than those of surface bound IgM molecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
