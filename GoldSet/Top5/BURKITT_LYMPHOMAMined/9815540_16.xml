<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Positive responses have been reported in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with 131I-radiolabeled Lym-1, a mouse anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the efficacy of 67Cu-radiolabeled Lym-1 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> mice bearing human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (20-524 mm3) were treated with 12.4, 14.8, 18.5, and 23.3 MBq of 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size was measured to assess efficacy, and mouse weight, blood counts, and mortality were monitored to assess toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In mice treated with 12.4, 14.8, and 18.5 MBq of 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1, 50% (9 of 18), 42% (5 of 12), and 50% (3 of 6) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> achieved remission or cure; 33% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were cured overall; and significant regrowth delay was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 23.3 MBq dose group did not yield meaningful efficacy data because of high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control groups receiving 14.8 and 18.5 MBq of the isotype-matched nonspecific monoclonal antibody radioimmunoconjugate, 67Cu-2IT-BAT-L6, 0% (0 of 15) and 17% (2 of 12) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> achieved a response; hence, targeted delivery of radiation was the dominant antitumor mechanism of 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LD50/30 for mice treated with 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 and -L6 were 21.6 and 20.6 MBq, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 67Cu-2IT-BAT-Lym-1 provided a therapeutic and frequently curative dose of radiation to tumored mice with modest toxicity </plain></SENT>
