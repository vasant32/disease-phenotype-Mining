<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interferon tau (IFN tau), originally identified as a pregnancy recognition hormone, is a type I interferon that is related to the various IFN alpha species (IFN alpha s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ovine IFN tau has antiviral activity similar to that of human IFN alpha A on the Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line and is equally effective in inhibiting cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, IFN tau was found to differ from IFN alpha A in that is was &gt; 30-fold less toxic to MDBK cells at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excess IFN tau did not block the cytotoxicity of IFN alpha A on MDBK cells, suggesting that these two type I IFNs recognize the type I IFN receptor differently on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In direct binding studies, 125I-IFN tau had a Kd of 3.90 x 10(-10) M for receptor on MDBK cells, whereas that of 125I-IFN alpha A was 4.45 x 10(-11) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the higher binding affinity, IFN alpha A was severalfold more effective than IFN tau in competitive binding against 125I-IFN tau to receptor on MDBK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, the two IFNs had similar specific antiviral activities on MDBK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, maximal IFN antiviral activity required only fractional occupancy of receptors, whereas toxicity was associated with maximal receptor occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, IFN alpha A, with the higher binding affinity, was more toxic than IFN tau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IFNs were similar in inducing the specific phosphorylation of the type I receptor-associated tyrosine kinase Tyk2, and the transcription factors Stat1 alpha and Stat2, suggesting that phosphorylation of these signal transduction proteins is not involved in the cellular toxicity associated with type I IFNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Experiments using synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> suggest that differences in the interaction at the N terminal of IFN tau and IFN alpha with the type I receptor complex contribute significantly to differences in high-affinity equilibrium binding of these molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that such a differential recognition of the receptor is responsible for the similar antiviral but different cytotoxic effects of these IFNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these data imply that receptors are "spare'' with respect to certain biological properties, and we speculate that IFNs may induce a concentration-dependent selective association of receptor subunits </plain></SENT>
