<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new EBV(-) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (GA-10) was established from a patient with a clinically aggressive, chemorefractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although functional p-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> could not be demonstrated by dye-efflux assays, both p53 genes were mutated in the GA-10 cells, perhaps contributing to the resistant phenotype of the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two properties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells which may be useful targets for novel cytotoxic therapeutics are their surface expression of CD77, the receptor for Shiga toxin (Stx), and their high rate of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD77 on the GA-10 cells was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in that certain subclones expressed high levels of CD77 and correspondingly exhibited strong growth inhibition by Stx while others showed low levels of CD77 expression and weak Stx-induced growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flavopiridol, a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression through G1 and G2, induced cytotoxicity of the GA-10 cells with an LC(50) of approximately 40 nM vs 70 nM for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of flavopiridol at which only 10% of the cells were viable (LC(10)) were approximately 280 nM for the GA-10 cells and 520 nM for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dose-related induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to flavopiridol was demonstrated in the GA-10 cells by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, TUNEL assay, and activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flavopiridol was also cytotoxic to seven other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that flavopiridol may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
