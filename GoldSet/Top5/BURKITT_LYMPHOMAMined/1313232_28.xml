<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42491">flavones</z:chebi> differed from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechins</z:chebi> in causing unwinding of duplex DNA, but both classes of compound induced enzymic DNA breakage at the same sites on DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cleavage specificity was the same as that for the known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24853">intercalator</z:chebi> 4'-(acridin-9-ylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide, suggesting that these agents trap the same cleavable complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of some 30 flavonoid compounds allowed elucidation of the structure-function relationships for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> inhibitors an unsaturated double bond between positions 2 and 3 of the pyrone ring and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43176">hydroxy groups</z:chebi> at the 5, 7, 3' and 4' positions favoured efficient cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hydroxy substitutions could be tolerated at the 3, 6 and 5' positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the absence of substituents at the 3', 4' and 5' positions could be compensated by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43176">hydroxy group</z:chebi> at position 6 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar requirements have been reported for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> inhibitors of protein kinase C that act competitively with ATP, suggesting interaction with a conserved protein feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Formation of the cleavable complex is a cytotoxic lesion that may contribute to the growth-inhibitory properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42491">flavones</z:chebi> observed for three human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in regard to the selectivity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
