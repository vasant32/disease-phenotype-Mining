<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little has been reported on socioeconomic (SES) patterns of risk for most forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based case-control data from epidemiological studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> conducted in five US states were pooled and associations of maternal, paternal and household educational attainment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancers</z:e> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using logistic regression, controlling for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was no association with parental education for the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> evaluated, there was an indication of a positive association with lower education for Hodgkin's and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilm's tumour</z:e>, with the ORs ranging from 1.5 to &gt;3.0 times that of more educated parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A possible protective effect was seen for lower parental education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>, with ORs reduced by 30 to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These study results should be viewed as exploratory because of the broad nature of the SES assessment, but they give some indication that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> studies might benefit from a more thorough assessment of SES </plain></SENT>
