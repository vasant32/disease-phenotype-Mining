<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of bcl-2 protein is associated with prolonged cell survival, whereas overexpression of bax correlates with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the ratio of bcl-2 and bax determines a cell's susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied bcl-2 and bax expression by immunohistochemical methods in 46 cases of B-cel non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> characterized by the Revised European-American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (REAL) classification to determine whether expression of these two proteins correlated with the histological subtype or the predicted clinical behavior (indolent v aggressive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each case, both the percentage of cells staining as well as the intensity of staining of bcl-2 and bax were recorded, and a bcl-2-bax protein ratio (BBPR) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bax staining was identified in 100% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bcl-2 staining was seen in only 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 expression correlated with the subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with positive staining in 100% of small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 80% of follicle center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 38% of diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 33% of high-grade B-cell Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 0% of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and 0% of B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BBPR of indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (mean, 1.8) was significantly greater than the BBPR of aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (mean, 0.6) (P &lt; or = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that bax and bcl-2 expression may be linked to biological behavior in non-Hodgkin's B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
