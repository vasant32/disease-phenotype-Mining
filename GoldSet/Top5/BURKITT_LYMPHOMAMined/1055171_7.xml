<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of the membrane fragments reflected the activity of the whole cells in that cells which did not form rosettes (P3J and RPMI 4098) resulted in inactive membranes and cells with high rosette formation (NC37 and Raji) yielded highly active membrane fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two test systems were devised to detect these receptor activities, namely a rosette inhibition and a hemagglutination assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Solubilization of C3 receptors was accomplished by extraction of active plasma membrane fragments with 2 MKBr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dissociation and reassociation experiments suggest C3b and C3d receptors to be highly complex <z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">molecular structures</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears that these complement receptors on plasma membranes rely on both protein and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> moieties for the expression of their activity </plain></SENT>
