<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously identified LDOC1 as one of the most significantly differentially expressed genes in untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) patients with respect to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of LDOC1, its contribution to the pathophysiology of CLL, or its prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated LDOC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in a large cohort of untreated CLL patients, as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood B-cell (NBC) subsets and primary B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed that LDOC1 is dramatically down-regulated in mutated CLL cases compared with unmutated cases, and have identified a new splice variant, LDOC1S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that LDOC1 is expressed in NBC subsets (naive &gt; memory), suggesting that it may play a role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also expressed in primary B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, in which its expression is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In CLL, we show that high levels of LDOC1 correlate with biomarkers of poor prognosis, including cytogenetic markers, unmutated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> status, and ZAP70 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that LDOC1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is an excellent predictor of overall survival in untreated CLL patients </plain></SENT>
