<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no data are available on the temporal variation of plasma/serum EBV DNA levels in patients with EBV-associated lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> during the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, we studied the plasma EBV DNA levels in 13 patients with EBV-associated lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, four with nasal natural killer/T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, two cases of PTLD and one patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) at presentation and during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma EBV DNA was detected in 12 of the 13 patients (median 2,266 copies/ml; interquartile range 181-8,379 copies/ml), but not in any of 35 healthy control subjects (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EBV status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was also examined in 12 of these patients using in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBER positivity was observed in 11 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had EBV DNA detectable in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The one patient who had no detectable plasma EBV DNA was also negative for EBERs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of plasma EBV DNA levels were performed in nine of the patients during the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who responded to therapy demonstrated a significant reduction of plasma EBV DNA to low or undetectable levels, whereas in two patients with ineffective therapy, disease progression was associated with a rapid increase in plasma EBV DNA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that plasma EBV DNA is detectable in a wide range of EBV-associated lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As plasma EBV DNA levels correlate well with the therapeutic response, such analysis may be a valuable tool for monitoring clinical progress </plain></SENT>
