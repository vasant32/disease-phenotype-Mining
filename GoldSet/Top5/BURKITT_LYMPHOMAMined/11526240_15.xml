<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established the emergence of the malignant clone in a child who developed t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with a t(11;19) (q23;p13.3) during treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MLL-ENL and the reciprocal ENL-MLL genomic fusions and their chimeric transcripts were characterized from samples collected at the time of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used PCR with patient-specific genomic primers to establish the emergence of the MLL-ENL fusion in serially obtained DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MLL-ENL fusion was not detectable in bone marrow at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 2 months of chemotherapy (frequency &lt;8.3 x 10(-7) cells(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genomic fusion was first detected in bone marrow after 6 months of treatment at a frequency of one in 4,000 mononuclear bone marrow cells; the frequency was one in 70 cells after 20 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the first detection of MLL-ENL, the only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> the patient had received were one dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> and two doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MLL-ENL fusion was not detectable in blood at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 0.7, 2, 8, 10, and 12 months of therapy but was detectable in blood at 16 months (one in 2.3 x 10(4) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinogenic Alu sequences bracketed the breakpoints in both fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the malignant clone was not present before therapy, arose early during chemotherapy, and was able to proliferate even during exposure to antileukemic therapy </plain></SENT>
