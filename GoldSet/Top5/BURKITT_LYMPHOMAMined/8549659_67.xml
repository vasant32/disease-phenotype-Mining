<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The subcellular distribution of the 60-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp60) was examined in a variety of mammalian cells and tissues, including Chinese hamster ovary cells, human fibroblasts, B-SC-1 kidney cells, Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and rat liver, by immunogold electron microscopy employing six different monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that are specific for Hsp60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cryosections or LR Gold sections of different cultured cells, intense labeling of mitochondria was obtained, typically 200-500 gold particles per mitochondrion and accounting for 80-85% of the total gold particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types and using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the antibodies, about 15-20% of the labeling due to Hsp60 was seen at discrete extramitochondrial sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such sites included those in close proximity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> outer membranes, foci on endoplasmic reticulum, on the cell surface, and in unidentified vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cryosections of rat liver, specific labeling due to Hsp60 antibodies was also observed within peroxisomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Labeling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cellular components by these antibodies could be prevented by preadsorption with purified recombinant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Hsp60 indicating that the labeling is specific for Hsp60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> labeling of cell surface proteins results in biotinylation of Hsp60 as analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blots, providing further evidence for Hsp60 presence on the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation experiments with Hsp60 antibodies show that under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions no detectable precursor Hsp60 protein is present in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in cells treated with the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> nonactin, which blocks <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> import, only the precursor form of Hsp60 accumulates, providing evidence that at least partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> import of Hsp60 is necessary for its maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results also provide evidence that no other 60-kDa protein other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Hsp60 is recognized by the antibodies used for electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings raise interesting questions concerning the possible role of Hsp60 at extramitochondrial sites </plain></SENT>
