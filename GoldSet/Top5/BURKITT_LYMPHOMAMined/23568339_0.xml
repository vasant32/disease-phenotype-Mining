<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic tools include CD20 stain to highlight lymphoepithelial lesions, Wotherspoon grading of the infiltrate, and clonality analysis of the B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MZoL may partially transform into a diffuse, large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which the authors have named blastic MZoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blastic MZoL may be present with or without small cell MZoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Without this component, blastic MzoL, while being CD10-negative, is presently difficult to positively diagnose since specific immune markers are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blastic MZoL has a very favourable outcome compared to conventional diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there are conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> in the stomach, mostly in a setting of a secondary organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biology of these gastric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> is identical to their extragastric counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is also true for primary gastric Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and mucosal involvement in B-CLL or mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unfavourable outcomes are always observed for EBV-triggered lymphoproliferations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which might also arise or be initially diagnosed in the stomach </plain></SENT>
