<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether patients in clinical remission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) continue to harbor leukemic cells is not known, because methods of detecting residual malignant cells have not been sufficiently sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This information might be useful for predicting recurrence and determining the duration of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a sensitive new method--identifying complementarity-determining region III sequences with the polymerase chain reaction--we estimated the number of residual leukemic cells in the bone marrow of eight children with B-lineage lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> before and after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Induction chemotherapy produced a 3-to-4-log reduction in the number of leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples obtained up to 18 months after diagnosis, however, 0.004 to 2.6 percent of bone marrow nucleated cells were residual leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the four patients studied more than 18 months after diagnosis, three had no detectable leukemic cells in marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this, one of them, who was no longer receiving therapy, had a central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient receiving maintenance chemotherapy, there was a 60-fold increase in leukemic cells three months before bone marrow relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complete disappearance of leukemic cells (or their reduction below our method's threshold of detection, 1 in 100,000 cells) may be necessary to achieve a cure of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The quantification of residual leukemic cells in serial marrow aspirates during therapy may allow the early detection of relapse </plain></SENT>
