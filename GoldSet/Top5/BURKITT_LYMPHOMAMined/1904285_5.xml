<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of combining the Lym-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used an in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis model that incorporated fresh CLL cells from 21 different patients as targets for two distinct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human leukocyte effector subsets, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lym-1 antigen (Lym-1-Ag) expression varied greatly and did not correlate with the expression of other CLL-associated antigens such as CD5, CD19, or HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLL cells were not lysed by neutrophils alone or with IFN-gamma in the absence of Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil Lym-1-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the absence of IFN-gamma was weak and inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma exposure induced MoAb-dependent lysis of 80% of 21 CLL targets and resulted in an eightfold augmentation of neutrophil ADCC against the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity correlated directly and positively with Lym-1-Ag expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of the need for interaction between neutrophil IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) and the Fc portion of the Lym-1 MoAb was obtained by demonstrating that purified Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) inhibited ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma exposure caused no consistent alternations in Lym-1-Ag expression on CLL cells so that target antigen upregulation was unlikely to account for augmentation of neutrophil ADCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PBMCs alone, exposed to interkeukin-2 (IL-2) or IFN-gamma, or with Lym-1 in the presence or absence of IL-2 or IFN-gamma were unable to lyse CLL targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PBMCs were able to kill Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in conjunction with Lym-1, so their ability to interact with Lym-1-coated targets and their lytic functions appeared intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the importance of examining fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with different leukocyte effector subsets before designing a clinical trial that combines a therapeutic MoAb with a cytokine </plain></SENT>
