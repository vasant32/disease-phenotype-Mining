<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have performed immunophenotyping studies on 186 untreated cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in an Egyptian population, using panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and an avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-immunoperoxidase detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two of these cases were tested with a panel of mAb directed against the T-cell markers CD2, CD4, CD8, B-cell markers CD20, kappa and lambda, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> antigen (common ALLa) and class II HLA antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 124 cases were also tested with additional markers of T- and B-cell precursors, namely CD7 and CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The common leukocyte antigen, T200, was used to exclude nonhemopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases that remained unclassifiable were further tested with a wider panel of T-cell markers, including CD1, CD2, CD3 and CD5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cases multiple mAb directed against the same antigens were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALL</z:e> were calculated from the total number of cases and were found to be 39.2% and 3.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of T-cell and null <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> were calculated from the better characterized subgroup of 124 cases, and were found to be 50% and 4.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our series, the age distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> revealed a peak at 2-5 yr, but this was partially obscured in the entire series by the high proportion of T-cell cases, which had an age peak between 4 and 12 yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate marked differences in the phenotypic pattern of ALL in Egypt compared to Western Countries, the predominant finding being a relative excess of T-cell ALL and a paucity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At present it is not clear whether this results from an increased incidence of T-cell ALL or a decreased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
