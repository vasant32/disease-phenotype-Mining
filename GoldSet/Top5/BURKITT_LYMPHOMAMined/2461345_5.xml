<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CR2, the receptor for the C3d fragment of the third complement component and for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown, on mouse B cells, to be involved in the control of B-cell proliferation by acting as a receptor for macrophage-derived growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the growth of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, RAJI, could be influenced by ligands of human CR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In serum-free culture, purified human C3d, as well as three monoclonal antibodies to distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on human CR2, were capable of enhancing the growth rate of RAJI cells two to five-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect could not be observed if even trace amounts of serum were present in the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous addition of pairs of antibodies did not enhance the growth rate, suggesting that a particular engagement of CR2 may be critical in order to induce a stimulatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in a homologous serum-free human B-cell system human C3d as well as monoclonal antibodies to human CR2 can induce B-cell proliferation and that CR2-mediated triggering of B cells can be induced via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> other than the C3d-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition we conclude that--unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cells--at least some human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells respond to CR2-mediated stimuli in the absence of any T-cell derived factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore the control mechanisms exerted through CR2 must still be intact on these autonomously growing cells </plain></SENT>
