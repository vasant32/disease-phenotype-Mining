<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cytotoxic response was obtained only when virally infected cells were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of the effector cells was restricted by the major histocompatibility complex and was directed against EBV-genome-bearing targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest cytolytic response was obtained when lymphocytes of individuals previously exposed to the virus (EBV-VCA positive) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes of noninfected donors (EBV-VCA negative) gave a low response; the relative frequency of their effector cells was at least 4-fold lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes of newborns did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic activity was mediated by T lymphocytes of the cytotoxic/suppressor subset, as determined by cytofluorographic analysis and antibody plus complement-mediated lysis, using monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte surface antigen </plain></SENT>
