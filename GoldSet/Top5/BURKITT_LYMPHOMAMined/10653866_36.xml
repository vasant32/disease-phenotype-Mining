<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored molecular features of DLCL with c-MYC/IGH fusion and the impact of this genetic abnormality on clinical outcome of DLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 203 cases of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> DLCL were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was subjected to long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) using oligonucleotide primers for exon 2 of c-MYC and for the four constant region genes of IGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve cases (5.9%) showed positive amplification; one had a c-MYC/Cmicro, nine had a c-MYC/Cgamma, and two had a c-MYC/Calpha fusion sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restriction and sequence analysis of the LD-PCR products, ranging from 2.3 to 9.4 kb in size, showed that breakage in the 12 cases occurred within a 1.5-kb region that included exon 1 of c-MYC in combination with breakpoints at the switch regions of IGH (10 of 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 cases, Myc protein encoded by the fusion genes demonstrated mutations and/or deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six cases had additional molecular lesions in BCL-2 or BCL-6 and/or p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The age range of the 12 patients was 44 to 86 years, with a median age of 65.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had stage I/II disease, and seven had stage III/IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase was elevated in nine of 11 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven showed involvement of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated by surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy; six died of the disease within 1 year, resulting in the poorest 1- and 2-year survival rates among DLCL subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The c-MYC/IGH fusion gene of DLCL is identical to that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (sBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DLCL with c-MYC/IGH shares clinical features with sBL but is characterized further by an older age distribution </plain></SENT>
