<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of the stem cells feeding the tumoral compartment is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this special point, we have studied the phenotypes of nine well-known human <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines (HMCLs) and compared them with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four clusters of differentiation involved in B lymphopoiesis were investigated using a panel of 65 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each cluster, the percentage of positive cells and the antigen density were determined, giving rise to a "quantitative phenotype" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We thus classified the HMCLs into two different groups: those with cytoplasmic mu chains (c <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) and those without (c mu-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first (c <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) group, comprising seven cell lines, the HMCLs had a phenotype of pre-B/B cells close to that of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They expressed low densities of surface mu chains, without detectable cytoplasmic or surface light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of them were infected with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These c <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi> HMCLs bore most of the B-cell antigens except CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They expressed the CALLA antigen (CD10) and lacked the plasma-cell antigen PCA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LCLs expressed surface light chains, high densities of CD23, low densities of PCA1 antigen, and no CD10 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The c mu- HMCLs had a plasma-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, lacking most of the B-cell antigens and expressing high densities of PCA1 antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
