<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now show, using a nuclear run-off assay, that this induction results from an increase in the rate of transcription of the c-fgr gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines freshly converted with the non-immortalizing HR-I strain of EBV do not accumulate higher levels of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting that EBNA-2 and/or LMP, the genes which are deleted in the HR-I strain, may be involved in the pathway which leads to changes in c-fgr gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the generality of a role for the c-fgr gene in the response of B-lymphocytes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV-infection</z:e>, which is controversial, we have analysed c-fgr expression in 6 freshly immortalized cell lines established by EBV (B95-8) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of B-lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults and of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, from cord blood, and from foetal liver </plain></SENT>
