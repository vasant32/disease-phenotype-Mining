<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an ELISA using recombinant human c-myc protein as the antigen, no difference in mean antibody titer was generally detected in these sera when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> sera (two myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> exhibited exceedingly higher levels of anti-c-myc antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, significantly elevated anti-c-myc antibody levels were found among 20 patients with African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ghana) and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Ghanians, thus apparently reflecting an autoimmune phenomenon prevalent in the endemic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that elevated levels of anti-c-myc antibodies are not a general characteristic of patients with diseases that have been associated with increased expression of c-myc </plain></SENT>
