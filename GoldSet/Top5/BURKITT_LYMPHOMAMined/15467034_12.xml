<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, on EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in a mouse model and explored its mechanism of action in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied EBV-transformed LCLs, which express a latent III (Lat-III) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene profile, as do some EBV-positive lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, which express a Lat-I <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene profile </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry, western blot analyses, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors were used to investigate components of prodeath and survival pathways in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi>'s effects on survival with a mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of EBV-positive human B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (groups of 10 mice) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">Depsipeptide</z:chebi> (5 mg/m2 of body surface area) treatment was associated with statistically significantly improved survival of mice carrying Lat-III EBV-positive LCL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, compared with that of control-treated mice (day 30: for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi>-treated mice, 90% survival, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.2% to 100%; for control-treated mice, 20% survival, 95% CI = 5.79% to 69.1%; P&lt;.001), but it was not associated with survival of mice carrying Lat-I EBV-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">Depsipeptide</z:chebi>-resistant LCLs expressed higher levels of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1; P = .017), BCL2 (P = .032), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (P&lt;.001) than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi>-sensitive LCLs; this resistance was circumvented by treatment with PS-1145, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
