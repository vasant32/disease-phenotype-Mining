<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody 1F5 recognizes human B-cell surface protein CD20 and can activate resting B cells; with this antibody we found CD20 to be a 35/37-kDa non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein has a pI of 7.5-8.0 and is phosphorylated in B-cell lines, tonsillar B cells, and peripheral blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both CD20 surface expression and phosphorylation are increased on buoyant tonsillar B cells activated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) supports the activation signal initiated by monoclonal antibody 1F5, we studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> on CD20 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After brief incubation with mitogenic levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, the number of dense tonsillar B cells positive for CD20 protein transiently decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, the cells remaining positive had more surface CD20 than did control cells, and these remaining surface CD20 molecules were hyperphosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> not only induced phosphorylation of CD20 protein on Raji cells but also increased the internalization of CD20 molecules; both phosphorylation and internalization of CD20 molecules were decreased with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> palmitoyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conditions that increase CD20 phosphorylation are shown also to increase surface mobility of the molecule, suggesting that CD20 protein internalization may be a critical early event for B-cell entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
