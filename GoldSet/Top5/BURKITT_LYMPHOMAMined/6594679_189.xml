<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To address the possibility that the expression of the myc gene might be regulated at a post-transcriptional level, we have investigated the half-life of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in various cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our survey included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human embryonic fibroblasts as well as transformed human cells of various origins: cervix <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HeLa), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> (MCF7), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Daudi), and promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HL60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these cells revealed an extreme instability of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (half-life, approximately equal to 10 min), suggesting that the control of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> degradation might be a general means (although not necessarily exclusive) of regulating both the level and the timing of myc gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a dramatic stabilization of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in HeLa, MCF7, and HL60 cells, suggesting that the controlling element might itself be, at least in these cells, a protein of rapid turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding opens the way to studying the mechanism of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> inactivation in these different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, protein synthesis inhibition had no effect on myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> instability in other transformed (Daudi) cell lines as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryonic human fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These different types of behavior suggest that the post-transcriptional control of myc gene expression might involve multiple factors that would be differently affected in various cell types </plain></SENT>
