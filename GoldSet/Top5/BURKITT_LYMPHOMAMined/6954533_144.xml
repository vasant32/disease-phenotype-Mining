<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences homologous to AMV was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> immature myeloid and lymphoid T cells in addition to the single erythroid cell line examined, but not in mature T cells or in B cells, including lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, induction of the cell line HL60, a promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line, to differentiate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> resulted in a reduction of the level of expression of the human cellular gene c-amv homologous to v-amv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable c-amv <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cell lines examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of the human c-amv gene could be correlated with the stage of differentiation of different hematopoietic cell types determined by morphologic and marker studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of c-amv could not be correlated with the extent of methylation in HL60 and in HL60 induced to differentiate with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
