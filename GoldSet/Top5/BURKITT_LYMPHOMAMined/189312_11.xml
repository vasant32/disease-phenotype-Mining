<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cDNA hybridized completely to its homologous 70S <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and was free of self-complementary sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequences complementary to MuLVR cDNA were found in DNA from tissues of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (2 of 8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (3 of 10), and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from spleen and kidney of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1709246" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonneoplastic disease</z:e> did not contain detectable MuLVR-related sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These virus-related sequences in the DNA from these neoplastic tissues were related but not identical to MuLVR sequences because differences of approximately 6 degrees in the midpoints of thermal elution profiles were found between the heterologous and homologous duplexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These nucleotide sequences are not the same as the proviral sequences of baboon type-C virus previously found from some other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> [Reitz et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(1976) Nature 262, 190-195], because there is no sequence homology between nucleic acids from MuLVR and baboon virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The absence of these nucleic acid sequences in many tissues of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and from the few tissues examined from people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1709246" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonneoplastic disease</z:e> suggests that they are not endogenous elements but are acquired after fertilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the previous detection of baboon and woolly monkey type-C <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> related components in some human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the results suggest acquisition of at least three types of type-C <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences in the human population </plain></SENT>
