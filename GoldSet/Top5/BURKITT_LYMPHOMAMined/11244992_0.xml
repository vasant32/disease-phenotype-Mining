<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ PCR and immunohistochemical techniques were applied to specimens from 28 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> on paraffin-embedded sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EB virus was found in 8 (28.5%) cases by PCR, of which 3 were positive by in situ PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive rates for the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were 44.4% and 48.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas in stages I-II and III-IV, they were 3(23.0%), 9(64.2%) and 3(23.0%), 10(71.4%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were high in stages III-IV, low in stages I-II (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive cases of EB virus in combination with the expression of p53 and bcl-2 protein, p53 protein and bcl-2 protein were 4,5,4 respectively and 9 cases were positive for p53 and bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In other words, the positive cases for EB virus in combination with the expression of p53 and bcl-2 were 50%, whereas 70% were positive for both p53 and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The positive rates of EB virus in our series are different from some reports of African-Burkitt's and similar to many other reports of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins are significantly correlated with stage; high in stages III-IV and low in stages I-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EB virus, p53 and bcl-2 proteins may affect each other </plain></SENT>
