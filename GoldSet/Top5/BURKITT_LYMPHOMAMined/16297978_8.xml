<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemosensitive (M1) and chemoresistant (M3) patients present &lt;5% and &gt;25% of residual leukemic blasts at 21 days of treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression profiles of 4205 genes for 32 patients included in the FRALLE93 protocol have been determined using microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From differential analysis, CD34, SPI-B and BCR distinguished M1 from M3 patients using microarray and RT-PCR data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and cross-validation show that the combined expression of these three genes classify and predict correctly around 90% and 80% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
