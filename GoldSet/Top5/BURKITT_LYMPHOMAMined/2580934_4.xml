<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In raising murine hybridoma antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced membrane antigens (MA), we found one antibody that blocked the release of infectious EBV from cultured P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognized a 200 kD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi>-sensitive (late) MA, and did not directly neutralize virus without complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When this mAb was added to 33 degrees C-cultured, spontaneously EBV-producing P3HR-1 cells, the intracellular expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen and infectious virus was not inhibited, but the appearance of infectious virus in the culture medium was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of this suppression was dependent upon the concentration of the mAb, an effect being observed to a 1:4 X 10(5) titer of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> mAb preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of suppression of EBV release was observed in a second model of 12-o-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> induction of EBV in 37 degrees C-cultured P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Again, intracellular infectious virus production was not inhibited, but the level of infectious virus in the culture medium was significantly reduced as early as 1 and 2 d of culture with antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was reversed within 31 h after replacement of mAb-containing medium with fresh medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This description of antibody-mediated inhibition of EBV release might lead to the characterization of another form of immune defense for the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
