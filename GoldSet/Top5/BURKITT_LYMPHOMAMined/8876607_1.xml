<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homogeneity is no longer a requisite for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as witnessed in mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell-rich B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which are composed of an admixture of neoplastic clonal B cells and reactive T cells which occasionally are very prominent in the histological picture </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> states, whether primary or acquired, are commonly associated with clonal lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> preceded by a polyclonal lymphoproliferative stage, which is usually reversible by reducing immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distinction between these stages is sometimes difficult to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunologists have so far failed to find a lymphatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific antigen, hence, monoclonality is usually based on a constellation of factors, namely homogeneity of the phenotypic expression of few antigens, aberrant expression of antigens and restricted expression of kappa- or lambda-chains in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> expressing surface immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom chromosomal translocations as well as other aberrations, usually important in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, are sometimes of limited value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the existence of translocations [like t(14;18) and t(2;5)] in nonmalignant states, and their non-specificity [the existence of t(8;14) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, t(2;5) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and t(14;18) in large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> evolving from follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
