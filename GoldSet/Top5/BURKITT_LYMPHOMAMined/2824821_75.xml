<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA-5) is encoded by highly spliced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> from the major IR1 (BamHI-W) repeat region of the virus genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mouse monoclonal antibody, JF186, has been raised against a synthetic 18-amino-acid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> deduced from the EBNA-5 message of B95-8 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody showed characteristic coarse nuclear granules by indirect immunofluorescence and revealed multiple EBNA-5 species by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The B95-8 line itself and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B95-8 virus-carrying cells, whether lymphoblastoid cell lines or in vitro-converted sublines of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines, were EBNA-5 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 36 cell lines carrying different EBV strains, only 10 expressed the B95-8-Raji-prototype EBNA-5 recognized by JF186; this was probably due to genetic variation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by JF186, as shown for P3HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human antibodies, affinity purified against EBNA-5-JF186 immunoprecipitates, detected EBNA-5 in the majority of EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoblastoid cell lines containing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBNA-5 can be expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> virus isolates examined, but is down-regulated, together with other latent gene products, in a minority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines which have a particular <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBNA-5 was detected as a ladder of protein species of 20 to 130 kilodaltons (kDa), with a regular spacing of 6 to 8 kDa, consistent with the coding capacity of the combined BamHI-W 66- and 132-base-pair exons, together with shifts of 2 to 4 kDa, consistent with the size of the separate 66- and 132-base-pair exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple EBNA-5 proteins can be expressed by the single cell as shown by cloning of newly infected cells </plain></SENT>
