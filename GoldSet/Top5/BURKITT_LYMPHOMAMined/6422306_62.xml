<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes are often joined at their 5' ends in opposite transcriptional directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a significant minority of Burkitt translocations involve the light-chain loci on chromosome 2 (kappa) or 22 (lambda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have characterized one of these from a European-derived cell line (IARC-BL37) that carries an 8;22 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here the translocation has joined the 5' portion of the lambda light-chain locus to the 3' portion of the c-myc gene at a position about 7 kilobases from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The translocation is reciprocal and relatively conservative, involving the loss of only 21 base pairs from the site of recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This translocation allows us to orient the lambda genes with respect to the centromere of chromosome 22 and to predict the orientation of other translocations involving these chromosomal segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3' translocation is accompanied by an increased level of c-myc transcripts, especially that derived from a normally under-used c-myc promoter </plain></SENT>
