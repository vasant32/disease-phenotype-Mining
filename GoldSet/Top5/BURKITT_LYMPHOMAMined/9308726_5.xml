<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we apply modern techniques and nomenclature to classify 73 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> from a central histopathology laboratory serving 40 mission hospitals in Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were particularly interested in the frequency of recently recognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and the incidence of Epstein-Barr virus in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> accounted for 12% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgical pathology specimens processed in the laboratory over the 21-month period included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient age ranged from 4 to 97 years (median, 35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 2.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (82%) were non-Hodgkin's, and 13 (18%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHLs), 52 (87%) were B-lineage, including 21 (35% of NHLs) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (only one from the jaw), 11 (18%) diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; nine (15%) small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, six (10%) Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, two (3%) follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (two of two expressed bcl-2 protein; one of two showed bcl-2 major breakpoint region rearrangement), two (3%) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and one extranodal marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the eight T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, six were precursor T-cell type, and the remaining two were peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, unspecified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median age of the 13 patients (18% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was 23 years (range, 9 to 97 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six were nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, four were mixed cellularity, one case each was lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, lymphocyte predominance, and unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hodgkin's cells in 6 of the 12 nonlymphocyte predominance cases were positive for CD20, and in three of the six for CD45 as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus was identified using in situ hybridization for EBER 1 in the malignant cells of 22 of 39 informative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including each of 17 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and three of seven diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of note, none of five Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed EBER 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One of two informative cases of peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and four of nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> were EBER 1 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In summary, T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and recently recognized B-lineage non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes do not appear to be particularly common in East Africa </plain></SENT>
