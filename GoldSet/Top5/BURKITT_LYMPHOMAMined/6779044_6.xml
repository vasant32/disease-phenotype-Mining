<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells were of B-cell origin in 23 cases and showed a non-B, non-T phenotype in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface immunoglobulins on blast cells were monoclonal, with a striking predominance of cases with light chains of lambda type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They consisted most often of high-density IgM usually without associated IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 3 patients had cells with surface IgG and 1 had surface IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blast cells lacked detectable IgG Fc receptors in more than half the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum immunoglobulins were studied in 15 cases: A monoclonal IgM was found in 5 patients (whose blast cells had surface IgM) and a Bence Jones protein was found in 2 others, both of whom had blasts with surface IgG lambda </plain></SENT>
