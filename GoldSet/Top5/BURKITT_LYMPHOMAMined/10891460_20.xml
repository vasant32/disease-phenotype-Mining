<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An attractive hypothesis is that in utero exposure of hematopoietic cells to oncogenic agents can induce molecular changes leading to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in infants and perhaps older children as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although supported by studies of identical infant twins with concordant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and of nontwined patients with MLL gene rearrangements, this concept has not been extended to the larger population of B-lineage ALL patients who lack unique nonconstitutive mutations or abnormally rearranged genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to demonstrate a prenatal origin for 7 cases of B-cell precursor ALL (either CD10(+) or CD10(-)) that had been diagnosed in infants and children 14 days to 9 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, we identified the same clonotypic immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity determining region or T-cell receptor V(D)2-D(D)3 sequences in the neonatal blood spots (Guthrie card) and leukemic cell DNAs of 2 infants with CD10(-) ALL and 2 of the 5 older patients with CD10(+) ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequencing showed a paucity of N or P regions and shortened D germ line and conserved J sequences, indicative of cells arising from fetal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest a prenatal origin for some cases of B-cell precursor ALL lacking specific clonotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
