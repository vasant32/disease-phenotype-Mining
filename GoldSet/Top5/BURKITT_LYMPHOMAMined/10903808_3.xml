<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to define a cellular model suitable for studying, in vitro, the molecular properties and functions of neurotrophin receptors in human lymphocytes, TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p75(NTR) expression was investigated in a panel of EBV immortalized lymphoblastoid (LCL) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) compared to primary B lymphocytes by RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data show that trkA and trkB are transcribed in most B cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For several of them, we also gained first evidence of trkC expression in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines and primary B cells lack p75(NTR) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that neurotrophin receptors expression in the B cell lines correlates to some extent with the phenotypic maturation stage and endogenous <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TrkA and TrkB, once activated, provide a partial rescue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, whereas TrkC stimulates the progression through the cell cycle without affecting cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the identification of a number of cell lines showing single expression of one of the Trk receptors has disclosed the availability of a cellular tool for further studies on their function, and mechanisms of signal transduction in the B cell moiety in the absence of p75(NTR) </plain></SENT>
