<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ALG contain a mixture of antibodies that recognize T- and B-cell-specific antigens but mostly nonlineage-specific molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that ALG could inhibit the proliferation of activated B cells and B cell lines (Bonnefoy-BÃ©rard et al, Blood 79:2164, 1992) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that ALG induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of several human hematopoietic cell lines, as shown by nuclear condensation and fragmentation in fluorescence and electronic microscopy and by double-strand DNA breaks shown by DNA electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was achieved without elevation of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> and requirement for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the B-cell lines tested (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, EBV-negative and groups I/III EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, as well as other B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines) were susceptible to ALG-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myelomonocytic and T-cell lines were much less susceptible than B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to ALG-induced cytotoxicity was not correlated with intracellular Bcl-2 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most cell lines that express high levels of Fas/Apo-1 antigen were susceptible to ALG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, several lines of evidence support the conclusion that, in addition to Fas/Apo-1, other cell surface molecules can mediate ALG-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic activity could be fully removed by adsorption on susceptible cell lines but not on a resistant cell line, indicating that it was mediated by antibodies specific for surface antigens expressed only on susceptible cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was triggered by ALG F(ab')2 fragments as well as by intact ALG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This cytotoxic property of ALG may account for their antiproliferative effect and might contribute to some extent to the relatively lower risk of posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> previously reported in ALG-treated patients </plain></SENT>
