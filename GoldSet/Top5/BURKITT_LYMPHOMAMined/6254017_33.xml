<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Potent cytotoxic T cells with preferred specificity directed to antigens expressed on autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) target cells were present in 14-day cultures of lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive donors and not from seronegative donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cytotoxic patterns obtained with a panel of HLA antigen-related and unrelated LCL target cells, supported by unlabeled target inhibition tests, strongly indicate that T cell cytotoxicity to EBV is restricted to HLA antigens </plain></SENT>
