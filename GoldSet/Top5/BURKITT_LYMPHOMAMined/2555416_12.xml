<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Raji lymphoblasts readily metabolized PAF by deacetylation-reacylation at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding studies conducted at 4 degrees C demonstrated specific binding that reached saturation within 80 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This binding was only partially reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of PAF binding data revealed a single class of PAF binding sites (17,800 +/- 3,600/cell) with a K of 2.3 +/- 0.3 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These high-affinity PAF binding sites were shown to be functional receptors, as 100 pM to 1 microM PAF increased free intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose of PAF necessary to achieve half maximal calcium mobilization response was 6.3 nM, which was in the range of the K for the receptor calculated from the binding studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structurally dissimilar PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> CV-3988 and BN52021 inhibited the PAF-induced calcium changes at doses that competed with PAF binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies provide the first evidence for a functional PAF receptor expressed on a lymphocyte cell line </plain></SENT>
