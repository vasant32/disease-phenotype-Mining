<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the nature of non-endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we examined neoplastic cells from eight American patients for receptors for sheep erythrocytes (E), complement (EAC), and Fc fragment of lgG (igGEA), and for surface immunoglobulins (Slg) and hydrolytic enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, we reviewed 47 biopsies and 17 autopsies from American patients to ascertain patterns of involvement by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in lymph nodes, spleens and Peyer's patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neoplastic cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studies bore monoclonal surface immunoglobulins of the igM class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Receptors for EAC and igGEA were identified on a minority of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Little or no hydrolytic enzyme activity was demonstrable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, like Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Africans, this histologically identical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in American patients consists of B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 biopsies and two autopsies, germinal centers were selectively involved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, suggesting that these neoplastic cells may be related to some B lymphocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centers </plain></SENT>
