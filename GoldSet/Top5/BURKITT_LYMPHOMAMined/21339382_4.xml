<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of the CD20-directed monoclonal antibody rituximab to CODOX-M/IVAC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, alternating with ifosfamide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) has not been studied despite efficacy in other aggressive CD20-positive NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients treated with or without rituximab were identified at our institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) are calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were fewer relapses in rituximab-treated patients (3 of 40 versus 13 of 40, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for improvement in outcome favoring rituximab-containing therapy, with 3-year PFS (74% versus 61%) and 3-year OS (77% versus 66%), although these did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advanced age and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement were associated with poorer OS on multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusting for treatment, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) involvement, and risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CODOX-M/IVAC, with or without rituximab, is a highly effective regimen for the treatment of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rituximab decreased the recurrence rate and showed a trend in favor of improvement in PFS and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HIV-infected patients achieved outcomes comparable with those of their non-HIV-infected counterparts </plain></SENT>
