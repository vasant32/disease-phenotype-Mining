<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the cysteine-rich interdomain region 1α (CIDR1α) of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) of the FCR3S1.2 strain, subsequently named CIDR1α, interacts with B cells partially through the binding to the B-cell receptor (BCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This interaction leads to an activated phenotype, increased survival, and a low degree of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CIDR1α preferentially activates the memory B-cell compartment, therefore PfEMP1 is considered to act as a polyclonal B-cell activator and its role in memory maintenance has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, we extend the analysis of the PfEMP1-CIDR1α B-cell interaction and demonstrate that PfEMP1-CIDR1α increases the expression of TLR7 and TLR10 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts and sensitizes B cells to TLR9 signalling via the MyD88 adaptor molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite its ability to bind to surface Igs, PfEMP1-CIDR1α-induced B-cell activation does not seem to proceed through the BCR, since it does not induce Lyn and/or phospho-tyrosine mediated signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather PfEMP1-CIDR1α induces the phosphorylation of downstream kinases, such as ERK1/2, p38 and IKBα, in human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PfEMP1-CIDR1α induces a persistent activation of B cells, which in turn can contribute to the exhaustion and impairment of B-cell functions during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
