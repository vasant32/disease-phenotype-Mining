<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression of receptors for IgA (Fc alpha Rs) was investigated on a panel of 35 human B cell lines by labelling with human secretory IgA (0.5 mg/ml) and flow cytometry analysis after staining with fluoresceinated goat anti-human secretory component and/or anti-alpha chain F(ab')2 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Receptors for IgA could be demonstrated on one out of nine Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, three out of five <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines and five out of 21 lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Fc alpha R-positive cells within the same B cell line varied upon repeated examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human dimeric IgA1 lambda <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> protein revealed the same number of IgA receptor positive cells as did secretory IgA, whereas monomeric IgA did not bind to Fc alpha R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection of Fc alpha R was not inhibited when the tests were carried out in the presence of human dimeric IgG, IgM, asialo-orosomucoid, and secretory component but it was abrogated by pre-treatment of the cells with trypsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The binding characteristics of Fc alpha Rs were studied on the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line Esteve, using 125I-labelled human dimeric IgA and secretory IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding was dose-dependent with rapid kinetics and specific inhibition by unlabelled secretory IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scatchard plot analysis resulted in an equilibrium constant K ranging from 3.2 to 4.7 x 10(6) M/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between Fc alpha R expression and differentiation stage, monoclonality, polyclonality of the cell lines, or Ig class produced by the B cells </plain></SENT>
