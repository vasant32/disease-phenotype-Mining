<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(12;21)(p13;q22) is the most common translocation in childhood B-precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It results in a <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 rearrangement and is associated with a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because many chromosomal alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> are associated with distinct cell surface phenotypes, we investigated whether there was an association seen between surface marker expression and the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 166 unselected cases of B-precursor ALL studied by Southern hybridization, 45 cases (27%) showed <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blasts of patients with <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement were much more likely to be CD9-negative, CD45-positive, CD13 positive, and CD20 negative, but the predictive value of any of these markers for the rearrangement was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 93% of patients with the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement had blasts that were either negative or only partly positive for CD9; this phenotype was only seen in 27% of patients without the rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only information about CD20 expression added to the predictive value of CD9 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of the phenotype CD9 (negative or partly positive) and CD20 (negative or partly positive), for the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement was prospectively tested on an additional 223 cases, and found to be 88% sensitive and 71% specific for the rearrangement, with a positive predictive value of 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyperdiploidy, previously shown to correlate negatively with the rearrangement, was a slightly more sensitive indicator (94%) but had a much lower predictive value (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of eight cases found to be rearranged by Southern hybridization but lacking the characteristic phenotype failed to show evidence of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that at least some of the discordant cases may involve partner genes other than AML1 in the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunophenotyping is highly predictive of the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For every 100 patients with B-precursor ALL, we estimate that prescreening by phenotyping would eliminate the need for molecular testing on 57 patients and only two or three of an expected 24 patients with the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi> rearrangement would not be detected </plain></SENT>
