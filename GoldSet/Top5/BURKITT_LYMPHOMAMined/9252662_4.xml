<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the cell growth inhibitory effects of telomere-mimic oligomers, 5'-d(TTAGGG)n-3' where n = 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the following 8 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines: 2780 <z:mp ids='MP_0003579'>ovarian carcinoma</z:mp>, HEp-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, VAMT-1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_365'>mesothelioma</z:mpath>, DND-1A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, MOLT-3 ALL, Jurkat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and JAR <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As controls, 1 scrambled 6-mer and 2 scrambled 24-mers were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the compounds tested, the 6-mer and 12-mer were not active in any of the cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increases in the length of oligonucleotides from 18- to 24-mer resulted in increased cell growth inhibitory activity in sensitive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells in suspension cultures, MOLT-3 ALL and Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were generally more sensitive than the monolayers (24-mer ID90 = -3 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the inhibitory effects of authentic 24-mer oligomer were more pronounced than the scrambled oligomers, both of the scrambled 24-mers also showed some degree of inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for modest activity of the 24-mer in 2 cell lines, DND-1A and 2780, none of the compounds tested were active against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that further study of the telomere-mimic 24-mer is warranted as candidate compound for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
