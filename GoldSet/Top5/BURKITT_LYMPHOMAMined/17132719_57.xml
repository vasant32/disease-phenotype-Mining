<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed the FAB/LMB96 trial to assess the possibility of reducing treatment in children/adolescents with intermediate-risk B-NHL without jeopardizing survival. "Early responding" patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response &gt; 20% at day 7) were randomized in a factorial design between 4 arms, 2 receiving half-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in the second induction course with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, Oncovin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, Adriamycin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (COPADM) and 2 not receiving the maintenance course M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 657 patients were randomized (May 1996 to June 2001) and 637 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis showed no significant effect of any of the treatment reductions on EFS and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4-year EFS was 93.4% and 90.9% in the groups with full-dose and half-dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (RR = 1.3, P = .40) and 91.9% and 92.5% in the groups with and without M1 (RR = 1.01, P = .98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no interaction between the 2 treatment reductions or between each treatment reduction and LDH level or histologic subtypes (Burkitt/Burkitt-like or large B-cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children/adolescents with intermediate-risk B-NHL who have an early response and achieve a complete remission after the first consolidation course can be cured with a 4-course treatment with a total dose of only 3.3 g/m2 cyclophosphamide and 120 mg/m2 doxorubicin </plain></SENT>
