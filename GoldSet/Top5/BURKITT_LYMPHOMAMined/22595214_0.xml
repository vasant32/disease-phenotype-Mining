<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases are thought to be typically found in low-lying, humid regions where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> is rife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, its incidence and relationship with malarial incidence in Northwest (NW) Province, Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were collected from the three tertiary referral centres for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> treatment in NW Province, Cameroon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> were collected from the Delegation of Public Health in Bamenda, NW Province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected between March and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 471 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The St Jude's stage of patients at presentation was as follows: stage I, 14.4% (43/299); stage II, 8.4% (25/299); stage III, 69.9% (209/299); stage IV, 7.4% (22/299) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> per 100,000 children &lt;15 years of age from 2005 to 2009 were as follows: 2005, 3.01 (29); 2006, 2.02 (20); 2007, 2.45 (25); 2008, 2.38 (25); 2009, 3.06 (33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average incidence in NW Province was 2.58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Ndop plain, Ngo-Ketunjia, the incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were as follows: 2005, 10.3 (10); 2006, 3.00 (3); 2007, 1.95 (2); 2008, 2.84 (3); 2009, 4.60 (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average incidence was 4.54/100,000 children &lt;15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrated a sinusoidal distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> cases throughout the year (P&lt;0.00), with a peak incidence on 10 April </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no sinusoidal distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases was demonstrated throughout the year (P = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No relationship was demonstrated between an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> malarial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Significant clustering was found, with the low-lying Ndop plain of Ngo-Ketunjia having an incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> nearly twice that elsewhere in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in NW Province, Cameroon remains one of the highest documented in the world </plain></SENT>
