<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of miR-9 in B lymphocytes, B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and classical Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (cHL) cell lines and its significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD19(+) B lymphocytes were sorted from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymph node by magnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total cellular micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from cHL cell line L428, B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Ly1 and Ly10 (diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), Raji cells (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and CD19(+) B lymphocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These micro-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were separately transformed into cDNA by reverse transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of miR-9 were measured by fluorescence quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-9 in cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of miR-9 was high in L428 cells (104.44 ± 1.61), and low in cell lines of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Ly1: 2.17 ± 0.38; Ly10: 1 �� 0.015; Raji: 2.65 ± 0.89), and extremely low in CD19(+) B lymphocytes (0.0026 ± 0.00040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with that in the other cell lines, the expression of miR-9 in L428 cells was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>miR-9 localized in the cytoplasm diffusely and strongly in L428, but scattered and slightly with some prominent distribution around the nuclear membranes in Ly1 and Ly10, and only weakly in Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: miR-9 highly expressed in cHL cell line and might be a molecular marker for diagnosis and treatment of cHL </plain></SENT>
