<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The MYC transcription factor is a master regulator of diverse cellular functions and has been long considered a compelling therapeutic target because of its role in a range of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, pharmacologic inhibition of MYC function has proven challenging because of both the diverse mechanisms driving its aberrant expression and the challenge of disrupting protein-DNA interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate the rapid and potent abrogation of MYC gene transcription by representative small molecule inhibitors of the BET family of chromatin adaptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MYC transcriptional suppression was observed in the context of the natural, chromosomally translocated, and amplified gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of BET bromodomain-promoter interactions and subsequent reduction of MYC transcript and protein levels resulted in G(1) arrest and extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exogenous expression of MYC from an artificial promoter that is resistant to BET regulation significantly protected cells from cell cycle arrest and growth suppression by BET inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MYC suppression was accompanied by deregulation of the MYC transcriptome, including potent reactivation of the p21 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a BET inhibitor resulted in significant antitumor activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of MYC is achievable through targeting BET bromodomains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such inhibitors may have clinical utility given the widespread pathogenetic role of MYC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
