<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proteins have been designated pNDCFs, proteins associated with nuclear dots and cytoplasmic filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their expression in human B cells was upregulated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or by exposure to anti-CD40 antibodies and IL4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically representative (type I) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines do not express pNDCFs or, if they do, the proteins accumulate preferentially in nuclear dots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines that have drifted to a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> phenotype during in vitro passage and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of non-neoplastic origin express these proteins regularly at high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are preferentially but not exclusively associated with vimentin filaments in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five pNDCFs can be upregulated by expressing the EBV-encoded membrane protein LMP1 in type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of them could also be upregulated in the human keratinocyte cell line RHEK-1 by LMP1 transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This upregulation was paralleled by the LMP1-induced increase in vimentin expression in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the pNDCFs, detected by the MAb DM_4A6, accumulated in cap-like structures under the cell membrane that colocalized with membrane patches of LMP1, in addition to its localization in nuclear dots and in association with cytoplasmic vimentin filaments </plain></SENT>
