<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0006859'>posterior leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome (RPLS) is a recently described clinical and radiological entity comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, altered level of consciousness and visual disturbances in association with transient posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002500'>cerebral white-matter abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We report a young woman with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who developed RPLS after combined chemotherapy administered during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The symptoms in this patient fitted well with those of RPLS; they included abrupt alterations in mental status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, visual changes and characteristic neuroradiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was given further combination chemotherapy without any neurological complications, at which time she had already recovered from both RPLS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although many etiological factors have been reported in the development of RPLS, the underlying mechanism is not yet well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With prompt and appropriate management, RPLS is usually reversible, and chemotherapy can be continued after complete recovery from RPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> should be considered as a contributory factor to the development of RPLS in patients for whom treatment with combined chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> is planned </plain></SENT>
