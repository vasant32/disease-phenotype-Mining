<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two distinct mismatch binding activities are detected using bandshift assays with human cell extracts and DNA with mispairs at defined positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One requires hMSH2 protein and is absent from extracts of LoVo cells, which contain a partial deletion of the hMSH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second activity is independent of hMSH2 and is present at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in LoVo and three other cell lines, which are defective in in vitro hMSH2-dependent binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two mismatch recognition activities are distinguished by their sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53323">polycations</z:chebi> and can be resolved by chromatography on MonoQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hMSH2-independent activity has been purified extensively from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells and from a cell line deficient in hMSH2-dependent binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purified material preferentially recognizes A-C, some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> mismatches, and certain slipped mispaired structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding exhibits some sequence preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The similar properties of the two mismatch binding activities suggest that they both contribute to mismatch repair </plain></SENT>
