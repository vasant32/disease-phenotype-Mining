<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fact that the p16/INK4a and p15/INK4b genes are frequently inactivated in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and that p16/INK4a null mice spontaneously develop B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> prompted us to examine the status of both genes in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found a low frequency of p16/INK4a and p15/INK4b deletions and mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, p16/INK4a exon 1 was methylated in 17 out of 19 BL lines (89.5%) and in 8 out of 19 BL biopsies (42%) analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p15/INK4b Exon 1 was also methylated, although at a lower frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p16/INK4a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was readily detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines carrying unmethylated p16/INK4a, but not in those carrying methylated p16/INK4a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No p16/INK4a protein was detected in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and biopsies examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one out of seven lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) examined was methylated in p16/INK4a exon 1, and three out of the six LCLs with unmethylated p16/INK4a expressed detectable levels of p16/INK4a protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the frequent p16/INK4a methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines correlates with downregulation of p16/INK4a expression, suggesting that exon 1 methylation is responsible for silencing the p16/INK4a gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
