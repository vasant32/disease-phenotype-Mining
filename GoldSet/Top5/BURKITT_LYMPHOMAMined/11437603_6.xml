<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new single-step purification method for Shiga toxin (Stx) was developed using receptor-mediated affinity chromatography, in which Gb3Cer (globotriaosylceramide) was conjugated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> CL-4B as a carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method achieves high yield and high purity in a small column on which Gb3Cer has been immobilized at high density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this affinity column, the Stx1 B subunit was purified with homogeneity by a one-step procedure from a crude extract of recombinant Stx1 B subunit-producing Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purified Stx1 B subunit conserved a natural pentamer structure confirmed by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the purified Stx1 B subunit was able to bind specifically to Gb3Cer expressed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This versatile purification method can be used to isolate various types of natural as well as recombinant Stx, facilitating fundamental studies of human diseases caused by this toxin </plain></SENT>
