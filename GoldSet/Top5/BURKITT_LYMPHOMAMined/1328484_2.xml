<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Daudi strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) possesses a genomic deletion, relative to the B95-8 EBV prototype, that removes the entire Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) open reading frame (ORF) and the sequences encoding the carboxy terminus of EBNA5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis carried out in this study indicates that two species of EBNA5 (31K and 37K) are expressed in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of Daudi cDNA clones has confirmed that, as a consequence of the genomic deletion, exons usually appearing further downstream in EBNA messages (exons U or HF) are spliced directly onto the truncated EBNA5 ORF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the use of alternative splicing suggests that the two EBNA5 species expressed in Daudi cells possess different carboxy termini </plain></SENT>
