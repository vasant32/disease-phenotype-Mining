<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Telomere maintenance is a prerequisite for immortalisation, and in most malignant cells is carried out by telomerase, an enzyme that synthesis new telomeric repeats on the chromosome ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reactive tissues with a high regenerative capacity, telomerase is regulated according to the telomere loss that occurs during proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the interaction of proliferation and telomerase activity in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we quantified telomerase expression in different non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the activity levels were the same in most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> analysed as compared to reactive lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher activity was detected only in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity correlated well with hTERT and c-myc expression, but was independent of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate interactions of telomere-binding protein expression on telomerase expression in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of TRF1, TRF2, tankyrase and hPif1 were assessed by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that the magnitude of telomerase upregulation does not necessarily reflect the requirement of telomere compensation caused by proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Telomerase regulation in non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is therefore uncoupled from proliferative stimuli found in reactive lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the upregulation of specific telomere-binding proteins like TRF2 may contribute to telomere maintenance in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
