<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, the highly sensitive ones always lacked Bcl-2(bcl-2 protein), while the DX resistant ones expressed Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Black93 is the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell-line derived from a ATLS patient, proving that cell lines can be established in vitro from ATLS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> lines expressing Bcl-2 were DX-sensitive, the relationship between Bcl-2 and DX-sensitivity is not straight-forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, however, the absence of Bcl-2 appears to be responsible for the DX-sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DX-sensitivity and the absence of Bcl-2 is a major characteristic carried by t(8;14) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there may be a stage of B-lineage differentiation without Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases have been reported to express TdT (terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase), Tree92 is the first such line, expressing S-Ig(mu, lambda), TdT and RAG (recombination activating gene)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When surface mu is ligated with antibody, RAG-1 was suppressed in expression, indicating that the signal through S-Ig can modulate the expression of RAG-1 in the Tree92 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosome translocation is known to be associated with a specific stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such specific stage for t(8;14), however, is broad enough to cover S-Ig(+), TdT(+) and RAG-1(+) stage, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the delineation of differentiation scheme of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells, are dependent on each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The documentation of the properties such as DX-sensitivity, the absence of Bcl-2, the expression of RAG-1 and its modulation by the signal through S-Ig is an example in which the diverse properties of human t(8;14) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> can contribute for delineating the differentiation scheme of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic cells more precisely </plain></SENT>
