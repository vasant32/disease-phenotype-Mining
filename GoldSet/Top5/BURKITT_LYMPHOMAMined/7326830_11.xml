<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reaction has a rapid phase in which approximately 40% of the O6MeG is removed in the first 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The capacity of cells for rapid O6MeG removal is limited and is saturated at concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> which do not saturate the systems removing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38635">3-methyladenine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> inhibits their ability to remove O6MeG produced by a subsequent dose given after 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with N-ethyl-N'-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) is effective in diminishing cellular capacity for O6MeG removal, and cells unable to remove O6MeG and sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> are also more sensitive to ENNG than their removal competent counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regeneration of the ability to remove O6MeG requires incubation of cells for periods greater than 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The O6MeG removal system is similar to that found in adapted Escherichia coli although the capacity of the Raji <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line much lower than that of the induced bacteria per unit of DNA </plain></SENT>
