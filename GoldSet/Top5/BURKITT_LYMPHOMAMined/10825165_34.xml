<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of mammalian <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II contains 52 repeats of a heptapeptide that is the target of a variety of kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hyperphosphorylated CTD recruits important factors for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> capping, splicing, and 3'-processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of the CTD for the transcription process in vivo, however, is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have conditionally expressed an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37415">alpha-amanitin</z:chebi>-resistant large subunit with an almost entirely deleted CTD (LS*Delta5) in B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells have a defect in global transcription of cellular genes in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37415">alpha-amanitin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pol II harboring LS*Delta5 failed to transcribe up to the promoter-proximal pause sites in the hsp70A and c-fos gene promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the CTD is already required for steps that occur before promoter-proximal pausing and maturation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
