<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt;180 mg/dL on ≥2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> ratio (I/C) &gt; 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0002), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0016), and average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0236) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0008), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0002), high systemic risk (P = .0173) and average <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0249) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>I/C ≥ 0.175 was the only significant (P = .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A glargine-plus-aspart intensive insulin regimen did not improve ALL outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Exogenous insulin may be associated with poor outcomes, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> may be associated with improved outcomes </plain></SENT>
