<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated antigen (BLA) or globotriaosylceramide (Pk antigen) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human tissues and in 194 haematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase labelling of frozen tissue sections with monoclonal antibody 38.13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Staining was seen in most tissues of the body and was most pronounced in the epithelial compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissue only dendritic reticulum cells, sinus-lining cells, macrophages and endothelial cells stained whereas lymphocytes were unlabelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, BLA was expressed strongly in 4/5 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather weak expression was seen in 8/120 of the other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which included cases of pre-B-stage, mid-stage and secretory-stage B-cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of BLA was also found in 3/54 T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 of activated T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>), 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and in 1 case of monocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between the expression of BLA and any particular surface Ig-type in the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BLA is neither a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-specific antigen, nor a typical B-cell differentiation antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results concerned with the antigen distribution in human tissues and haematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> preclude the use of 38.13 as a reagent for diagnosis or specific in vivo immunotherapy of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
