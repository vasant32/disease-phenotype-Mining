<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, different relationships between the clinical response to IL-2 treatment and the LAK cytotoxicity have been reported using these three different target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether the LAK cytotoxicities measured against these target cells represent similar effector-to-target-cell interactions, so similar conclusions may be drawn of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay results in which the cell lines are used as target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PBMC depleted of different natural killer and T cell subsets was measured against the three targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LAK cell recognition of targets was evaluated by cold target inhibition experiments, and the development of LAK-cell-mediated lysis with time was evaluated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assays of varying duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study shows that LAK-mediated lysis of T24 and Daudi cells was closely related and LAK cytotoxicity measured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assays against these two target cells may be measurement of similar effector-to-target cell interactions </plain></SENT>
