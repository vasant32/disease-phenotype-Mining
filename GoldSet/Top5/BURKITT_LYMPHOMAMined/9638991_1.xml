<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 35-year old male who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> following high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> therapy for Burkitt's non Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> levels reached 37 micromol/l, and remained higher than 1 micromol/l for more than a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Folinic acid rescue was intensified to 200-400 mg intravenously every 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> binds markedly to proteins, plasma exchange was initially chosen, 4 sessions being performed from day 2 to day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> pharmacokinetic profile was not significantly modified during plasma exchange, and serum drug level was 3 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was therefore performed from day 5 to day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure also seemed ineffective, with evidence of low ultrafiltrate clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No extrarenal toxicity was observed in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, conventional extrarenal procedures appear to have a limited role in the setting of overexposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of very high doses of folinic acid in our case probably played a major role in the eventual favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
