<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protection was associated with up-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase of Bcl-2 expression induced by TNF-alpha was inhibited by chelerythrine, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that Bcl-2 expression was dependent on PKC activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol esters</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA), which prevent Ca(2+)-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, up-regulated Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of CsA on Bcl-2 expression is controlled by calcineurin since we have shown that FK506 but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> had the same effect on Bcl-2 expression, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of phosphatases 1, 2A and 2C, was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide direct evidence that TNF-alpha prevents Ca(2+)-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism mediated by PKC </plain></SENT>
