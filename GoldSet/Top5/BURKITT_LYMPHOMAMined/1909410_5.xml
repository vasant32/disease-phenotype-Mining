<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> of the B-cell lineage demonstrate more than two rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes when examined by Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of the extra bands was investigated by molecular cloning and sequencing of four rearranged genes from one patient's leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four rearrangements were apparently derived independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the rearrangements used the VH6 variable region, attached to different diversity and joining regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the two rearrangements contained a mutation in the coding sequence leading to the generation of a nonsense codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This rearranged gene also differed from the other VH6 containing gene starting at about 330 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third rearranged gene used a member of the VH2 variable gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A DH-JH rearrangement was found in the fourth rearranged gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> probably arose as a result of the transformation of an early B-cell progenitor that lacked rearranged immunoglobulin genes but retained some differentiation potential </plain></SENT>
