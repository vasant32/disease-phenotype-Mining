<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The values of n, Dq, and Do derived from the survival curve after a single dose X-irradiation resulted in small values as 1.1, 10 rad, and 125 rad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum recovery of about 5% was observed 3 hr after the irradiation by a split-dose experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the survival curve derived from a split-dose irradiation, n and Dq increased while Do remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reason for these increases in n and Dq may be attributed to the nonhomogeneous or mixed population response </plain></SENT>
