<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IL-7 was originally reported as a cytokine produced by stromal cells which supports pre-B cell proliferation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether human B cells secrete IL-7 and express IL-7R we studied a wide panel of B cell lines (CLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Northern blot analysis we detected 2.4 kb IL-7 mRNA and by quantitative PCR we demonstrated IL-7 expression in 5 of 6 B CLS derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AABCL), 3 of 3 CLS derived from patients with American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 5 of 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid CLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of 5 African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CLS and 2 of 7 EBV- CLS expressed IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 484-bp amplicons was cloned and sequenced and found to correspond to the original IL-7 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constitutive IL-7 secretion was detected in 5 of 6 AABCL and in 6 of 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid CLS but in none of the 7 EBV- CLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-7R expression was demonstrated in 8 of 26 CLS, none of which secreted IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that 1) IL-7 mRNA is expressed in malignant B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp>, which correspond to a narrow window in the B cell differentiation pathway (pre-B, early B, intermediate B), as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid B CLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2) IL-7 mRNA is expressed in both EBV+ and EBV- CLS, but only the EBV+ CLS secrete IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3) B cells activated by both EBV and HIV-1 (AABCL) secrete the greatest amount of IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4) IL-7 autocrine loops are not evident since IL-7R were detected on on CLS, which do not secrete IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data provide the first direct evidence of IL-7 secretion by human cells and it is yet to be determined whether IL-7 is secreted by other cell types </plain></SENT>
