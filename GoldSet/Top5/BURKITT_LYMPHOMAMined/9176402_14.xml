<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This notion has recently been challenged because cultured microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) derived from various organs are unable to express VCAM-1 after exposure to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have established a method for isolation and culture of nasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-derived microvascular ECs and report their cytokine-regulated VCAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a combination of cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, such expression was shown to be induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner not only by IL-1 beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha but also by IL-4 and IL-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the response of nasal microvascular ECs did not harmonize with that of counterparts from several other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-4 or IL-13 combined with submaximal concentrations of IL-1 beta or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha increased VCAM-1 expression in a synergistic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 was functional as shown by antibody-mediated inhibition of leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results supported the notion that selective VCAM-1 induction by IL-4 and IL-13 plays an important role for the preferential recruitment of eosinophils and T lymphocytes seen in human airways affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
