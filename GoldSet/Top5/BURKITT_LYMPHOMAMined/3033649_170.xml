<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of individual EBV genes in this process was evaluated by introducing each of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes that are normally expressed in EBV growth-transformed and latently infected lymphoblasts into an EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, using recombinant retrovirus-mediated transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clones of cells were derived that stably express the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), EBNA-2, EBNA-3, EBNA-leader protein, or EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were compared with control clones infected with the retrovirus vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 clones converted to EBNA-2 expression differed from control clones or clones expressing other EBV proteins by growth in tight clumps and by markedly increased expression of one particular surface marker of B-cell activation, CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other activation antigens were unaffected by EBNA-2 expression, as were markers already expressed on the parent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> markers (cALLA and BLA), proliferation markers (transferrin receptor and BK19.9), and cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>-related molecules (LFA-1 and LFA-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased CD23 expression in cells expressing EBNA-2 was apparent from monoclonal anti-CD23 antibody binding to the cell surface, from immunoprecipitation of the 45-kDa and 90-kDa CD23 proteins with monoclonal antibody, and from <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> blots probed with labeled CD23 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that EBNA-2 is a specific direct or indirect trans-activator of CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This establishes a link between an EBV gene and cell gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since CD23 has been implicated in the transduction of B-cell growth signals, its specific induction by EBNA-2 could be important in EBV induction of B-lymphocyte transformation </plain></SENT>
