<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patterns of expression of simple (GlcCer, LacCer) and globo-series GSL (Gb3, Gb4) were found for each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> expressed the neo-lacto series GSL, paragloboside, which was not significantly seen at later stages of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> expressed about 10 times higher ratios of simple GSL to Globo-series GSL as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, regardless of stage of differentiation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GSL phenotype in these cells was not grossly affected by cell genotype since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> containing Philadelphia chromosome t(9q;22q) translocations were similar to other ALL; and DHL with t(8q;14q) translocations had GSL patterns similar to other DHL samples and dissimilar to GSL patterns found in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with t(8q;14q) </plain></SENT>
