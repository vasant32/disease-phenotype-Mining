<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type II Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma RII) is one of those proteins that undergo Ser phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon affinity isolation of the Fc gamma RII, several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23367">molecular entities</z:chebi> are coisolated from <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 lysates of BL41 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line which undergo "in vitro" (cell free) phosphorylation in the immune complex-associated kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several molecules phosphorylated on Tyr upon sIgM cross-linking in the intact cells are coisolated with Fc gamma RII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 59-kDa coprecipitated component is identified as the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) fyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clustering the sIgM molecules enhanced the in vitro phosphorylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> molecules coprecipitated with Fc gamma RII as well as that of the exogenously added PTK substrate, enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Kinase renaturation assays suggest that at least two major renaturable protein kinases (59 kDa and 85-90 kDa) associate with Fc gamma RII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas the 59-kDa component comigrates with the PTK fyn, the 85- to 90-kDa one is an unidentified Ser/Thr kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Fc gamma RII exists in the B-cell membrane as part of a multimolecular complex including protein kinases, activities of which are regulated by clustering of the antigen receptors </plain></SENT>
