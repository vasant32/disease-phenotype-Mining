<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using anti-Tac, a monoclonal anti-interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor antibody, we have explored the possibility that certain activated B cells display receptors for IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and unselected B cell lines established from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were Tac antigen negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the cell surface Tac antigen expression was demonstrable on 6 of 10 B cell lines from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 of 6 B cell lines derived from patients with HTLV-I-associated adult T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four that had integrated HTLV-I into their genome), and on certain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells activated with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cloned Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines derived from Tac-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells continued to express the Tac antigen in long-term cultures and manifested high affinity IL-2 receptors identified in binding studies with purified radiolabeled IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The line 5B4 developed in the present study could be induced with purified JURKAT-derived or recombinant IL-2 to express a larger number of IL-2 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the addition of IL-2 to the 5B4 B cell line augmented IgM synthesis, which could be blocked by the addition of anti-Tac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the IL-2 receptors expressed on the cloned <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell lines was similar (53,000-57,000 daltons) to that of receptors on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, certain malignant and activated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells display the Tac antigen and manifest high affinity receptors for IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IL-2 may play a role in the differentiation of activated B cells into immunoglobulin-synthesizing and -secreting cells </plain></SENT>
