<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells in the latter showed lymphoblastoid features similar to those seen in parallel cultures to which transforming Epstein-Barr (EB) virus instead of P. falciparum derived substances had been added </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations appear relevant to both the choice of P. falciparum derived antigens as vaccines, and to the interaction of EB virus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> in the aetiology of African Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
