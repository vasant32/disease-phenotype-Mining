<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immediate-early (IE) BZLF1 gene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) regulates the switch between latent and lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that the cellular transcription factor ZEB1 binds to a sequence element, ZV, located at nt -17 to -12 relative to the transcription initiation site of the BZLF1 promoter, Zp, repressing transcription from Zp in a transient transfection assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the phenotype in the context of a whole EBV genome of a variant of EBV strain B95.8 containing a 2-bp substitution mutation in the ZV element of Zp that reduced, but did not eliminate, ZEB1 binding to Zp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, epithelial 293 cells latently infected with the EBV ZV mutant spontaneously produced IE-, early-, and late-gene products and infectious virus, while <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT)-infected 293 cells did not and have never been reported to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment with the chemical inducers <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> and 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) led to an additional order-of-magnitude production of infectious virus in the ZV mutant-infected 293 cells, but still no virus in the WT-infected 293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, ZV mutant-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> BJAB cells accumulated at least 10-fold more EBV IE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> than did WT-infected BJAB cells, with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> treatment leading to an additional 5- to 10-fold accumulation of EBV IE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in the ZV mutant-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that ZEB1 binding to Zp plays a central role in regulating the latent-lytic switch in EBV-infected epithelial and B cells, suggesting ZEB1 as a target for lytic-induction therapies in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
