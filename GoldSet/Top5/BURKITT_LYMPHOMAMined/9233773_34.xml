<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of B lymphocytes through their antigen receptor (BCR) results in rapid increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, which leads to a cascade of biochemical changes that initiates B cell proliferation and differentiation or growth inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel cDNA, designed APS, encoding an adaptor protein with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a tyrosine phosphorylation site was cloned from a B cell cDNA library using a yeast two hybrid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APS is structurally similar to SH2-B, an SH2 protein that potentially binds to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) as well as Lnk which is postulated to be a signal transducer that links T-cell receptor to phospholipase Cgamma, Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS expressed only in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells among cell lines we examined and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APS bound to Shc irrespective of stimulation and bound to Grb2 after stimulation, suggesting that it plays a role in linkage from BCR to Shc/Grb2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that APS, SH2-B and Lnk form a new adaptor family that links immune receptors to signaling pathways involved in tyrosine-phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
