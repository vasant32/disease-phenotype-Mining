<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pattern of specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> found in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed a remarkable concordance with the predictions deducible from the animal systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> contains <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> homologous only to that of the murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mammary tumor</z:e> virus (MMTV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (including Hodgkin's and Burkitt's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> with sequence homology to the murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (RLV) and not to MMTV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, as in the case of the mouse, none of the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> examined contain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> related in sequence to that of the avian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679427" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myeloblastosis</z:e> virus (AMV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> was demonstrated to be of high molecular weight (1 times 10(7) daltons) and encapsulated with a reverse transcriptase in particles having densities between 1.16-1.19 g/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of these human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> particles was related in sequence to the murine viruses that cause the corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, 4 features diagnostic for the murine oncogenic viruses are satisfied by the particles found in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was shown by "recycling" experiments that the DNA from human leukemic cells and from lymphomatous tissue contained particle-related sequences that could not be detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding was further substantiated by studies with identical twins in which it was shown that the leukemic twin contained particle-related sequences that could not be detected in the leukocytes of his identical healthy sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are inconsistent with hypotheses that require chromosomal transmission in the germ line of complete copies of the information required to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and the associated virus particles </plain></SENT>
