<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of the surrogate light chain (psiL) - made of the lambda-like (or lambda5) and the VpreB proteins - is a B cell-specific maturation marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an anti-human VpreB mAb (4G7), we recently identified in human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrows, proB and preB cells that express the psiH-psiL proB (proBCR) and the mu-psiL preB (preBCR) receptors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, FACS and biochemical analysis confirm the broad proB and preB reactivity of the 4G7 mAb that contrasts with the narrow specificity of other available anti-psiL reagents for preB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mAb was used to explore intracytoplasmic and cell surface expression of the VpreB protein on a series of 92 precursor B cell ALLs (from 40 child and 52 adult patients), in combination with 24 other mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major result concerns the identification within proB (or BI) and common (or BII) ALLs, of proBCR and proBCR+ ALLs that express the VpreB in the cytoplasm or at the cell surface, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of ALLs within these two VpreB sub-groups differ considerably between the ALL origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric series, ALLs present in the majority a proBCR+ phenotype whereas we observed a proBCR+ phenotype for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on VpreB expression, and in combination with other published data, we propose a refined classification for precursor B cell ALLs </plain></SENT>
