<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>North Africa is a geographical area with a high incidence of NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose in this study was to explore cell-mediated immunity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with UNPC and DNPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an elevated percentage of OKT8 cells and of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) (30-35% HNK-I-positive cells) compared to PBL from healthy matched individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBL from NPC patients contained 35% HLA-DR-positive and 30% Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-positive circulating lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBL from NPC patients exhibited a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and Concanavalin A (Con A) and an increased response to pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Natural killer (NK) activity towards K562 cells was low in our patients who, in addition, exhibited no lytic activity against HLA-matched EBV-transformed B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This lack of cytotoxicity against an EBV-transformed B-cell line cannot be explained by an impairment of IL-2 secretion, and is probably a result of the presence of high numbers of OKT8 suppressor T cells </plain></SENT>
