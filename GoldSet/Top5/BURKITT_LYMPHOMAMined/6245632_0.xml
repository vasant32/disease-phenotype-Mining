<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used two radiolabeling methods to study <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> on the surface of lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the methods affects tritiation of residues which are oxidized with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase and the other causes tritiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach was shown to allow a better resolution of cell surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> than if either method were used alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">Glycoproteins</z:chebi> of B1--19 cells which harbor the Epstein-Barr virus genomes were compared with those of its parental cell line, BJAB, which does not harbor the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies did not reveal a unique <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 28,000 mol. wt. <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was found to be the most prominent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi>-labeled product of B1--19 cells and also of the two other cell lines, Raji and Ly38, which harbor the EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar molecular weight species from BJAB cells identified by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> oxidase labeling might be deficient in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi> residues as it was poorly labeled by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="49826">periodate</z:chebi> oxidation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi> content and level of sialyl transferase of BJAB cells were found to be lower than those of the other cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
