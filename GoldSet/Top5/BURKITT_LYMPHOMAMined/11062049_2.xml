<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yeast one-hybrid screen analysis using the -50 to -37 sequence of Qp as the bait was carried out to identify transcriptional factors that may control Qp activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that Smad4 binds the -50 to -37 sequence of Qp, indicating that this promoter is potentially regulated by TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of Smad4 with Qp was further confirmed by supershift of EMSA complexes using Smad4-specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transfection of a Qp reporter construct in two EBV(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, Rael and WW2, showed that Qp activity is repressed in response to the TGF-beta treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This repression involves the interaction of a Smad3/Smad4 complex and the transcriptional repressor TGIF, as determined by cotransfection assay and coimmunoprecipitation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that TGF-beta may transcriptionally repress Qp through the Smad4-binding site in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
