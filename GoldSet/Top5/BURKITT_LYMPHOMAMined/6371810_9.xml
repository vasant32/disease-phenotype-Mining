<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This communication describes the preparation of antibodies to human interleukin 2 (IL-2), using as immunogens synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits and mice were immunized with protein carrier conjugates of eight chemically synthesized IL-2-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, each consisting of 13-15 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immune antisera were screened in a solid-phase ELISA for reactivity to a native human IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to four of the eight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were found by a variety of biological and immuno-chemical criteria to react against human IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an affinity-purified antibody to one of the IL-2 peptides (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 84) specifically stained the cytoplasm of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes or T-leukemic cells (Jurkat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to synthetic IL-2 peptides should serve as useful probes for studying this lymphokine and for developing quantitative assays for measuring its levels in biological fluids and its association with disease </plain></SENT>
