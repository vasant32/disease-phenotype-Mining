<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the expressions of class I and class II major histocompatibility antigen complex (MHC) on the surface of Jijoye and P3HR-1 cells of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jijoye cells had a large amount of class I and class II MHC antigens, whereas these antigens were less expressed on P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On a subline of P3HR-1 K cells the expression of class I antigen markedly diminished and class II antigen was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Jijoye, P3HR-1, and P3HR-1 K cell lines were confirmed to be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nonproducer, low producer, and high producer, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chemical activation of EBV genome by treating P3HR-1 cells with 12-O-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13 acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> resulted in inhibition of the expression of class I and II antigens, while the addition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of virus replication, blocked the decrease in the MHC antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that there might be an inverse correlation between the virus production and the expression of class I and II MHC antigens </plain></SENT>
