<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The blood counts, blood films, marrow smears, trephine and tissue biopsies of patients at diagnosis were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scheme proposed by the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group (REAL) was utilised for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subclassification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 21.3% had lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 21.3% had peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (unspecified), 29.8% had diffuse large B-cell NHL, 10.6% had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 17% had others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, one or more abnormal counts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo>, increased marrow reticulin and marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> at diagnosis were 66%, 85.1%, 41.3%, 40.9% and 44.7% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow involvement was present in 46.8% of the patients, with diffuse infiltration noted in 71.4% of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal counts and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the NHL subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological abnormalities</z:e> were peripheral atypical lymphocytes and diffuse marrow involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (unspecified), common features were peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo>, increased marrow reticulin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In diffuse large B-cell NHL, peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo>, peripheral myeloid precursors and/or nucleated red cells and marrow involvement were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse marrow involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted between most of the haematological parameters of B and T-NHLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison with other reports, we recorded higher overall incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and diffuse marrow involvement, and a lower incidence of marrow infiltration in peripheral T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (unspecified) </plain></SENT>
