<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether cultured Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth rates were measured using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and colony formation assays, and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was quantified using Annexin V and DNA fragmentation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying observed growth suppression were examined using Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of CA46 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> for 48 h markedly decreased the rate of cell proliferation; an IC50 value of 10 μM was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colony formation was almost fully suppressed at 10 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CA46 cells underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> treatment as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of cells stainable with Annexin V, by increased DNA fragmentation, and by activation of the intrinsic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>) pathway for cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as characterized by increased expression of the cleaved forms of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> was found to down-regulate anti-apoptotic and up-regulate apoptotic components of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations at which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> altered expression of components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in CA46 cells were comparable to those that suppressed growth and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, supporting the hypothesis that the observed growth-inhibitory and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2981">baicalin</z:chebi> in these cells are mediated by down-regulation of this pathway </plain></SENT>
