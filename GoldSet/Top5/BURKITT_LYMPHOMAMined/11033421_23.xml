<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oxidants such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> can induce a low level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at low concentrations but at higher concentrations cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> also inhibit the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by chemotherapy drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One theory is that, at higher concentrations, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> causes direct oxidative inactivation of caspase-3 activity, thus preventing the apoptotic pathway from being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that treatment of recombinant caspase-3 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> can partially reduce its enzymatic activity: However, the following findings show that this does not occur in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) The inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cellular caspase-3 activity can be overcome by adding inhibitors of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) at sub-stoichiometric concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Delayed addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>-treated cells prevents additional caspase induction but does not inhibit the caspase activity that has already been generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> is a poor inhibitor of caspase-3 activity in cell lysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> to cells inhibits activation of caspase-9, which is required for activation of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inhibition of caspase-3 activity in the cell occurs indirectly at a step located upstream of caspase-3 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> acts in part by inducing DNA strand breaks and activating PARP, thus depleting the cells of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When this pathway is blocked, even high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> can induce caspase-9 and -3 activation and cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
