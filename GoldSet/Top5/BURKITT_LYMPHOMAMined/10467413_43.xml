<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This mechanism has also been proposed for translocations t(4;11)(q21;q23), which are regularly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pro-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, reciprocal chromosomal breakpoints in primary biopsy material of fourteen t(4;11)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, duplications, deletions and inversions of less than a few hundred <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> indicative of malfunctioning DNA repair mechanisms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We concluded that these translocation events were initiated by several DNA strand breaks on both participating chromosomes and subsequent DNA repair by 'error-prone-repair' mechanisms, but not by the action of recombinases of the immune system </plain></SENT>
