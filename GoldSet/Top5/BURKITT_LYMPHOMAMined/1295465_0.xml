<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This genetic event may either occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> malignant cells or be acquired by different subclones, which however, cannot be demonstrated adequately by analyzing only DNA derived from patient specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The availability of the ras p21 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Y 13259 makes possible the direct study of the distribution of the ras gene product in human malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report the expression of the ras p21 oncoprotein in the bone marrow smears of 35 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> has been analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The smears were treated with the MoAb Y 13259, biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG, streptavidin, peroxidase and stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the staining was evaluated by two independent observers as negative or equivocal (-/+), moderate (+) or intense (++), by counting one thousand cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were also classified according to the percentage of the stained cells into four groups (0, I, II, III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that 22/35 (63%) were (+) or (++) positive as follows: 11/21 (52%) with ALL CALLA (+), 2/2 ALL-B, 3/3 ALL-T and 6/9 AML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Group 0 (none of the blasts was stained) were 13/35 (37%), as well as in Group I (1 to 25% of the blasts stained 1+ or 2+ positive), while in Group II (26 to 50% positive stained) 3/35 and in Group III (more than 51% stained) 6/35, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (6/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the immunohistochemical analysis of the ras p21 in blast cells of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> may demonstrate that ras gene expression in some subclones, the intensity and percentage of which may be of some clinical importance </plain></SENT>
