<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the role of CD40 signaling in the activation of gamma germline transcription and as an extension, in targeting Cgamma regions for isotype switching, an IgM+ Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Ramos 2G6) was assayed for the up-regulation of germline gamma transcripts after CD40L stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Independent Ramos 2G6 subclones that either expressed (Igamma+) or did not express (Igamma-) basal levels of Igamma transcripts were assessed for their transcriptional response to CD40L signaling by contact with either a Jurkat T cell line (D1.1) or a transfected CD40L-expressing epithelial cell line (293/CD40L) in the presence or absence of IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both Igamma- and Igamma+ Ramos 2G6 subclones cultured with IL-4 and CD40L markedly up-regulated germline transcription predominantly from the gamma1, gamma2, and gamma3 subclasses over levels obtained with IL-4 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, these two signals were required to obtain de novo switch recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, incubation with CD40L alone resulted in a substantial increase in germline transcription only in the Igamma+ and not the Igamma- subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Observed basal transcription at the gamma1 locus also correlated with the ability of not only the gamma1 locus, but also the gamma2 and gamma3 loci, to up-regulate germline transcripts in response to CD40 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with CD40:CD40L contact up-regulating germline transcription only after the B cell has received a signal that alters the transcriptional state of the heavy chain locus </plain></SENT>
