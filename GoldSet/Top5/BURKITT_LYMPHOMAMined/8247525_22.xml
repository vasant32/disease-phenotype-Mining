<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The identification of Max, a basic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein, as a partner for Myc has provided insights into Myc's molecular function as a transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that the relative abundance of Myc and Max is important to determine the level of specific gene transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we have identified two major in vivo phosphorylation sites in Max (Ser-2 and -11) which can be modified in vitro by casein kinase II (CKII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of these sites modulates DNA-binding by increasing both the on- and off-rates of Max homo- as well as Myc/Max heterodimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data indicate that the steady state binding of the shorter version of Max (p21) to DNA was similar yet its rate of dissociation faster than that of longer version of Max (p22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data argue that different Max complexes have different kinetic properties and that these can be modified by CKII phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose this as an important biological mechanism by which different dimeric complexes can exchange with varying efficiencies on DNA, thereby responding to changes in cell growth conditions </plain></SENT>
