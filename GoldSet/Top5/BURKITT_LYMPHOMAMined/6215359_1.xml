<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were described to carry receptors for iC3b, C3d, C3b-beta 1 H and beta 1 H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversial opinions, however, exist whether or not these cells carry also receptors for C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using highly purified C3, definitely devoid of beta 1 H and C5, for preparation of C3b intermediates, it could be shown that Raji cells bound to C3b cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Raji cells reacted with monoclonal antibodies that interfered with binding of C3b to human erythrocytes, lymphocytes and renal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The receptor for C3b on Raji cell, however, exhibited some special properties and, therefore, required some distinct experimental conditions for its detection: (1) The origin of the erythrocytes used for preparation of the C3b intermediates seemed to be important; this was not the case when iC3b and C3d receptor reactivity was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Rosettes already formed between Raji cells and EAC1423b showed the tendency to disintegrate within the first 30 min after the rosette formation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Again, this effect could not be observed with iC3b- and C3d-dependent rosette formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Incubation of the Raji cells at 37 degrees C as well as 4 degrees C before rosette formation resulted in a rhythmic loss and reappearance of C3b receptor reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At room temperature (19-22 degrees C) this effect was much less expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no influence of preincubation at 4 and 37 degrees C, respectively, on the iC3b and C3d receptor reactivity of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(4) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17941">Diisopropylfluorophosphate</z:chebi> (DFP) present during rosette formation enhanced, within a certain range of concentration, the percentage of C3b-dependent rosette formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>iC3b and C3d receptor reactivity was not influenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A similar reaction pattern was observed with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM)-stimulated tonsil lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the concentrations tested, DFP showed no effect on the rosette formation between C3b, iC3b, and C3d cells, respectively, and unstimulated tonsil lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggest that C3b receptors on Raji cells undergo some special metabolism, possibly controlled by fluid phase or cell-bound proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This might be a common property of C3b receptors on blast-like and transformed cells, differing from that of unstimulated small lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
