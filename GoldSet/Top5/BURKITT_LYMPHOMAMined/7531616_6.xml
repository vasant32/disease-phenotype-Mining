<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model to compare the efficacy of unconjugated CD19 and CD20 mAbs (IgG2a subclass) in mediating antilymphoma effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the CD20 mAbs NKI-B20 and BCA-B20 resulted in a drastic decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> take rate (P &lt; 0.0001) in comparison to controls, whereas the CD19 mAb CLB-CD19 was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor growth</z:e> rates were reduced by both CD19 and CD20 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in growth rate induced by NKI-B20 or BCA-B20 was larger than that induced by CLB-CD19 (P = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments showed that NKI-B20 or BCA-B20 are more powerful than CLB-CD19 in mediating lysis by interleukin 2-activated natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between different isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b) of the switch variants of NKI-B20 or CLB-CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between antigen density and the sensitivity to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was demonstrated with human lymphoblastoid B cells, JY, transfected with cDNA encoding the human CD19 antigen that expressed high levels of this antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cells are more efficiently killed by natural killer cells when coated with CLB-CD19 mAbs than JY <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> cells that express 1 log lower levels of the CD19 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity experiments with thioglycolate-activated macrophages show a more complex relationship between antigen density, isotype of the mAb, and cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCA-B20 (IgG2a) and CLB-CD19 (IgG2a) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isotypes of NKI-B20 mediated strong cytotoxicity, whereas CLB-CD19 isotypes IgG1 and IgG2b were associated with limited cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of Daudi cells was inhibited with high concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isotypes of CLB-CD19, but not with any of the CD20 mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report showing that the antitumor effects in vivo of unconjugated CD20 mAbs are far superior to those of CD19 mAbs </plain></SENT>
