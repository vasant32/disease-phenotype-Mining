<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PEL) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> of B-cell origin that is associated with HHV-8 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PEL cells harbor a non-B, non-T phenotype and lack significant surface immunoglobulin (Ig) expression, a characteristic that has not been fully explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrate that PEL cells constitutively express interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4, a transcription factor that regulates the activity of the immunoglobulin light-chain enhancer elements lambdaB and kappaE3' through binding to a composite Ets-IRF site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IRF-4 activity requires its physical interaction with PU.1, an Ets family member involved in the activation of genes essential for B-cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in PEL-derived B-cell lines, PU.1 expression was completely abrogated; expression of the B cell specific transcription factor Oct-2, which is known to regulate PU.1 expression, was also abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the B-cell-specific coactivator of octamer factors, BOB-1/OcaB, was expressed at very decreased levels in PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of Oct-2 was able to fully restore PU.1 promoter activity in the PEL cell line BCBL-1, while PU.1 expression also reconstituted the activity of the lambdaB Ets-IRF site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, protein levels of BSAP/Pax-5 and IRF-8/ICSBP were undetectable in PEL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of transcription factor ablation observed in PEL was found to be comparable to that observed in classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>-derived cell lines, which also lack B-cell-specific surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that disruption of the B-cell-specific transcriptional program is likely to contribute to the incomplete B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> characteristic of PEL cells </plain></SENT>
