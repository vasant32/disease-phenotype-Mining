<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only EBNA1 can be detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived cell lines that maintain the representative phenotype during culture in vitro (group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This restricted pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression is accompanied by extensive EBV DNA methylation and can be reversed by treatment with the demethylating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the genes encoding the six transformation-associated EBNAs can be initiated from one of two promoters located in the BamHI C and W regions, respectively, of the virus genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that discrete sites within the BamHI W enhancer region are methylated in the group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines Rael, Cheptage, and Elijah and become unmethylated after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment that induces the expression of EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demethylation correlates with activation of transcription from the BamHI W promoter as determined by S1 protection analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reporter plasmids in which the W enhancer sequences were linked to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene were active in untreated Rael, Cheptage, and Elijah cells, demonstrating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the required transcription factors are present in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in vitro methylation of the enhancer sequences abolished their activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that methylation of control regions in the EBV genome may play a critical role for the regulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
