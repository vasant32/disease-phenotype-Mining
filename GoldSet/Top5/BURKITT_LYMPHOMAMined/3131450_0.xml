<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The induced dissociation of stacks of annulate lamellae in multinuclear cells of P3J, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multinuclear cells form as a portion (15-25%) of the population when growth of P3J is prevented by high concentrations (100-200 micrograms/ml) of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cells in the population form stacks of annulate lamellae when incubated in DFMO and when the action of DFMO is reversed by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi>, the annulate lamellae disappear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the typical (uninucleate) cells in the population, the multinucleate ones do not divide following the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17148">putrescine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During dissociation, the annulate lamellae fragment into small segments of cisternae and vesicles of various sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although some of the electron-dense pore material is dispersed in the cytoplasm, much is retained with the vesicular elements that form </plain></SENT>
