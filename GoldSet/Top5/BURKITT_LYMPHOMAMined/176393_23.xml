<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No cytotoxic activity was detected against unifected RAJl cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that this antibody-mediated cytotoxic reaction was directed against the same EBV-induced membrane antigens (MA) previously defined by the membrane immunofluorescence (MF) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody to EBV-associated early antigens did not participate in this in vitro reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody titers to EBV-induced MA were significantly higher by the ADLC assay in comparison with the MF test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A preliminary study showed no relationship between high antibody titers and the presence of EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible in vivo significance of this immune reaction was discussed </plain></SENT>
