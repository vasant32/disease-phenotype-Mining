<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined the localization of c-myc and the immunoglobulin kappa light chain genes on the 8q+/2p- chromosomes of the three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines BL21, LY66 and LY91 with t(2;8) translocation by in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BL21 is characterized by a complex translocation in which a piece of chromosome 9 appears to be located between the fragments of chromosome 8 and 2 on the 8q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines the c-myc gene is located on the 8q+ chromosome proximal to the breakpoint in band 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines examined the cluster of kappa variable genes has remained on the 2p- chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In LY91 cells the major part of the joining region remained on 2p-, while the joining region has moved to 8q+ in the cell lines BL21 and LY66 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines the constant kappa light chain gene was found on the 8q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fact that an essentially identical pattern was found in the cell line BL21, with the complex translocation, suggests that the insertion of the piece of chromosome 9 into the 8q+ chromosome might be a secondary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our present data fit into the concept that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines investigated so far, including cases with t(8;14) and the variant translocations t(2;8) and t(8;22), the c-myc gene becomes situated at the 5' side of an immunoglobulin constant gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may have implications for the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the coding and non-coding part of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
