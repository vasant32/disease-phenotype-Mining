<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein report on a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/ALL-L3 indicating solitary recurrence in the tonsil after a 3-year remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 50-year-old man was diagnosed as having Burkitt's type ALL-L3 with involvement of the stomach and abdominal lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was treated with intensive chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (ALL-BFM86 protocol), and a complete remission was achieved </plain></SENT>
