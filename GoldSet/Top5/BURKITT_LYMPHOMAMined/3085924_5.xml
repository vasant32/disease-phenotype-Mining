<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Used alone, DFMO (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml; 0.21 mM) prevents cell proliferation in liquid culture and reduces the number and size of colonies that form in a two-layer soft agar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In combination studies in which the soft agar system was used, DFMO was used at 15 and 25 micrograms/ml, concentrations which reduced the number of colonies to approximately 65 and 50%, respectively, of control plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (Adriamycin) was combined with DFMO, synergistic effects were noted at both DFMO concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">Cisplatin</z:chebi> and DFMO were synergistic at the higher DFMO concentration and were supraadditive at 15 micrograms DFMO/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination studies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9984">vinblastine sulfate</z:chebi> (Velban) with DFMO did not deviate significantly from the predicted additive response </plain></SENT>
