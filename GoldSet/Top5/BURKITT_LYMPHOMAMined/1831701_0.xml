<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Namalva (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line), and fresh leukemic bone marrow cell cultures was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HFDI was found to inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and leukemic cell growth as assayed by 3H-TdR incorporation, cell degeneration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and to induce differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the characteristics of PHA-inhibited lymphocyte transformation were, in fact, identical to those of HFDI-inhibited degeneration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and HFDI-induced differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It seems that <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was related to target cell sensitivity to HFDI </plain></SENT>
