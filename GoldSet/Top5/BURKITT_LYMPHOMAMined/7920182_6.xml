<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BLR1 shows significant relationship to receptors for chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1 beta) and neuropeptides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the murine homologue of the human BLR1 receptor was isolated and used to study its tissue-specific expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blr-1 consists of two exons encoding a protein of 374 amino acid residues which shows 83% identity with the human homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues of adult BALB/c mice revealed that blr-1-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is detected consistently at low levels in secondary lymphatic organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blr-1 gene is expressed regularly and strongly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of mature B cells but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice deficient in the development of mature B cells have strongly reduced levels of blr-1-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine mediated induction (IL4, IL6) of terminal differentiation of resting B cells towards Ig-secreting plasma cells completely downregulates expression of blr-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization using brain sections demonstrates blr 1 transcription in the granule and Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The precise delineation of the restricted expression pattern of the blr-1 gene will support the identification of its ligand and may provide a clue to understand how BLR1 exerts its biological function within the immune and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
