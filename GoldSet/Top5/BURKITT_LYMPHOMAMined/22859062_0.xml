<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored the effects of FX and its deacetylated product, fucoxanthinol (FXOH), on B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both FX and FXOH reduced the viability of these malignant B cells in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by the induction of cell cycle arrest during G1 phase and caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FXOH was approximately twice more potent than FX in these activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood mononuclear cells were resistant to FX and FXOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong and constitutive activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a common characteristic of many B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and FXOH suppressed constitutive NF-κB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NF-κB inhibition was accompanied by downregulation of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic and cell cycle regulator gene products, including Bcl-2, cIAP-2, XIAP, cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that FX and FXOH are potentially useful therapeutic agents in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> characterized by aberrant regulation of NF-κB </plain></SENT>
