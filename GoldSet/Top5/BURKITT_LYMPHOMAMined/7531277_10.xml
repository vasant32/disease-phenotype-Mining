<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the alterations of cell cycle-regulating genes produced by IFN still remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we studied the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes during IFN-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle synchronized and unsynchronized Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were treated with IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the cell cycle distribution and the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes (cdk2, cdc2, cyclins A, B, C, D3, cdc25, and wee 1) were studied by flow cytometry and by Northern blot hybridization or the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treated cells passed through the first G1 phase and gradually accumulated in the following G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of cyclins A, B, and D3 oscillated along with the cell cycle progression in control cells, and the alterations of cyclin B expression were especially prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both cdc2 and cdk2 also showed changes, but these were not so distinct as observed with cyclin B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of cdc25 and wee1 was little affected by cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In IFN-treated cells, expression of cyclins A and B were down-regulated, while that of cyclin C was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D3 expression was also down-regulated at 48 h, followed by an increase at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of both cdc2 and cdk2 was down-regulated, especially that of the later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Wee1 expression was down-regulated by IFN but, the expression of cdc25 remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the modulation of cell cycle-regulating genes, particular by cyclin A and cdk2, plays an important role in IFN-induced cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
