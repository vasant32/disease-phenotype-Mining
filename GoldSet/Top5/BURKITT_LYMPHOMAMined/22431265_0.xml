<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that nanoparticles irradiated by intense lasers are capable of conveying damage to nearby cells for various therapeutic and biological applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work ultrashort laser pulses and gold nanospheres are used for the generation of localized, nanometric disruptions on the membranes of specifically targeted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high structural stability of the nanospheres and the resonance pulse irradiation allow effective means for controlling the induced nanometric effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique is demonstrated by inducing desired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mechanisms in epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and initiating efficient cell fusion between various cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main advantages of the presented approach include low toxicity, high specificity, and high flexibility in the regulation of cell damage and cell fusion, which would allow it to play an important role in various future clinical and scientific applications </plain></SENT>
