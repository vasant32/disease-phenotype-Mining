<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">Mutagen</z:chebi> sensitivity was measured in terms of cell survival and mutation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">Thymidine</z:chebi> kinase-deficient Raji cells showed decreased survival and increased mutant frequency relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells following treatments with each of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagens</z:chebi> used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this may be due to an imbalance in the supply of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23636">deoxyribonucleoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphates</z:chebi> to the excision repair process </plain></SENT>
