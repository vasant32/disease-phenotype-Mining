<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A case of primary Burkitt's cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the liver is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 14-year-old Chinese boy presented with a 10-day history of postprandial epigastric pain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative imaging studies revealed a large solid mass confined to the right lobe of the liver; there was no evidence of involvement of other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was serological and immunohistochemical evidence of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">B virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete removal of the mass was achieved by right hepatic lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed a small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of Burkitt's type that immunostained positively for B-cell markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient remains well, with no evidence of disease &gt; 8 years after surgical resection and combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only five cases (two children and three adults) of primary small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the liver have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe this is the second reported case of childhood hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with long-term disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed to elucidate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">B virus infection</z:e> and the development of a primary small noncleaved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the liver </plain></SENT>
