<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HLA class II typing by sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) on the family of a Burkit's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> patient produced hybridization patterns indicating the presence of two DRB1, and two linked DQB1 genes on the same maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DRB and DQB1 exon 2 amplification products associated with the novel maternal haplotype were identified by DNA typing techniques: These products corresponded to DRB1*0101, DRB1*1501, DRB5*01, DQB1*0501 and DQB1*0602 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These alleles were seen to co-segregate among siblings sharing the same maternal haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient, his mother and two of his siblings each appeared to possess elements of three DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA DNA typing results indicated that a DNA sequence of approximately 100 Kb, spanning the region between, and including, DRB1 and DQB1 genes was inserted into the maternal haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serological typing on EBV transformed B lymphocytes obtained from the patient's mother showed three expressed DRB1 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serology on EBV transformed patient's cells also indicated multiple DRB1 antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of three DRB1 and DQB1 genes on the cells of this patient would make it virtually impossible to obtain a suitably matched unrelated stem cell donor </plain></SENT>
