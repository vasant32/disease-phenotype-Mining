<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 22-base-long oligonucleotide, which is rich in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanines</z:chebi> and folds into an intrastrand DNA tetraplex under physiological conditions, was administered to a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line overexpressing a (8:14) translocated c-myc allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of the oligonucleotide at nanomolar concentrations to the surrounding medium resulted in efficient cellular uptake, and was accompanied by a substantial concentration- and conformation-dependent decrease in growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss how c-myc transcription is initiated at the molecular level and speculate that the oligonucleotide exerts a dual effect on c-myc expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
