<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 sera from healthy individuals and from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) were studied with respect to antibody responses to each of the seven known transformation-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded antigens [latent membrane protein (LMP) and six nuclear proteins (EBNAs 1 to 6)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were detected using modified standard immunoblotting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to LMP were detected for the first time in sera from 6/27 (22%) healthy, EBV-immune individuals (seropositive for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence of anti-LMP antibodies was found in EBV-immune sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (17/24 positive; 71%), NPC (21/33; 64%), and RA (16/21; 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to EBNA 1 were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-immune sera at a standard 1:20 dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to the other EBNAs were detected in only a proportion of these sera (20 to 95%) at the same dilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only minor disease-associated differences in the incidence of these antibodies were observed, the most consistent being that RA sera had a higher incidence of antibodies to EBNAs 2 to 6 compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing of the sera at a 1:100 dilution suggested that there were some disease-related differences in the titres of anti-EBNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this serum dilution, a reduced incidence of antibodies to EBNA 2 was seen in NPC (6/31) compared with RA (18/19) and healthy EBV-seropositives (16/26); antibodies to EBNA 3 were detected at an increased incidence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (8/15) and NPC (16/31) compared with control sera (7/26); antibodies to EBNA 4 were detected at increased incidence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (5/15) and RA (6/19) compared with control sera (1/26); and antibodies to EBNA 6 were detected at increased incidence in NPC (19/31) and RA (7/19) compared with control sera (3/26) </plain></SENT>
