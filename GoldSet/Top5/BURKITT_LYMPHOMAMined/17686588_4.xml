<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> community has gradually acknowledged the existence of chemo brain as an unintended consequence of anti-neoplastic therapies, other fields of medicine have been less astute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary research evidence has suggested a role for many existing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35471">psychopharmaceuticals</z:chebi> in fighting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, based upon the capacity of these drugs to modify gene expression, cell turnover, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The author presents the hypothesis that the same mechanisms which suppress the growth and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells may pose similar hazards to non-diseased neurons, thereby inducing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> which oncologists have come to associate with chemo brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The article discusses the specific examples of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47780">clomipramine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> as treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinicians, regardless of specialization, are encouraged to consider the potential reality of psychotropic chemo brain, in order to avoid or limit the use of medications which cause it, and in order to prioritize the delivery of rehabilitative strategies in an effort to mitigate or reverse its features </plain></SENT>
