<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Surface phenotyping by flow cytometry and cytochemical study were used to identify 15 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> displaying ambiguous phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences were found in the blast cell karyotype and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> expressing B lymphoid and myeloid markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The karyotypic abnormalities, t(9;22) and t(4;11), were noticed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>acute biphenotypic leukemia</z:hpo>, and were consistently associated with rearrangement at the immunoglobulin locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coexpression of CD19/CD20 and either myeloperoxidase or myeloid surface markers were predictive of finding the t(9;22) or t(4;11) karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with TdT-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, on the other hand, were less likely to show rearrangement at the immunoglobulin locus, and did not have the t(9;22) or t(4;11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, a variety of nonrandom karyotypic abnormalities were seen, including <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike common <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the majority of TdT-positive cases demonstrated an abnormal karyotype with duplications and/or deletions present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In no instance was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, t(8;21), t(15;17), or any other isolated translocation identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore suggest that immunophenotyping, when combined with cytochemical analysis of TdT and myeloperoxidase or Sudan black B, may aid in the characterization of subgroups of atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, such that alternate approaches to therapy can be evaluated </plain></SENT>
