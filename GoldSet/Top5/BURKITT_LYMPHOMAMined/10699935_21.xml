<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated whether MMR might act as an efficient repair pathway and provide protection against the clastogenicity induced by CCNU and whether the hypersensitivity of MMR-defective cells is extended to other cross-linking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in cell killing and in the frequency of micronuclei was observed after CCNU exposure in 2 hPMS2-defective clones (clones 6 and 7) compared with the parental HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Introduction of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> copy of chromosome 7 in clone 7 led to re-expression of the hPMS2 protein and brought survival and chromosomal damage upon CCNU exposure to parental levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that MMR protects against the clastogenic damage induced by this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hPMS2-defective HeLa cells were also hypersensitive to killing by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">Mitomycin C</z:chebi> sensitivity was confirmed in an hMLH1-defective clone derived from Raji cells and in msh2-defective mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from knock-out mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>hPMS2-defective and parental HeLa cells were transplanted into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, and the animals were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While parental cell growth rate was unaffected, the growth of MMR-defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the in vitro hypersensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> conferred by loss of MMR is paralleled in vivo and may have implications for the chemotherapy of MMR-defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
