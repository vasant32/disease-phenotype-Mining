<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a highly aggressive, small, non-cleaved B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form of the disease that occurs in non-endemic areas around the world, most commonly in developed countries, patients usually present with an abdominal mass that frequently involves the ileocecal region of the bowel; ocular or orbital involvement is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Primary disease</z:e> of the sinuses is uncommon and, to the best of our knowledge, that of the anterior septum has never been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the diagnosis and successful management of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating from the nasal septum in a male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: An otherwise healthy 78-year-old Caucasian man who did not smoke cigarettes was admitted to our Ear, Nose and Throat outpatient clinic with the complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>nasal obstruction</z:hpo> due to left-sided nasal septal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paranasal computerized tomography revealed a well-circumscribed solid mass originating from his anterior nasal septum and obstructing his airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was verified by immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patient had a good clinical outcome after chemoradiotherapy, with no problems reported to date in the second year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We provide what we believe to be the first report of a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving the nasal septum, and describe the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Being an original case report with broader clinical impact across more than one area of medicine, this case presentation has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and we emphasize the need to include this disease in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a nasal septal mass </plain></SENT>
