<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were cells with relatively low levels of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the S-phase (Type I) and a high level in the S-phase (Type 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-cells, B-cells, nucleated red cells and CD34+/CD19+ early B-cells in bone marrow were Type I, whereas myelomonocytic subset and CD34+/CD33-dim+ common myeloid cells were Type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AC133+/CD38-dim cells, which were thought to be lineage-marker negative hematopoietic stem cells, had intermediate amounts of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the S-phase between Type I and II (Type 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the T- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cases were found to be Type I, most of the ANLL cases were Type II, and there were 10 cases that were Type 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings yielded fundamental information about <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
