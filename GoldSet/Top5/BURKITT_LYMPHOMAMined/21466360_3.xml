<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is endemic in Uganda and because of the high incidence, diagnosis is often presumed during clinical care and epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of the clinical and the local pathology diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> as assessed by an outside pathology review diagnosis and to understand the limitations on histopathology practice in a resource-constrained setting at 1 hospital in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinically presumed pediatric (&lt;15 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases with biopsies and pathology reports, from 1993 to 2007, were identified at St Mary's Hospital, Lacor (Gulu, Uganda) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local histopathology procedures, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin-stained tissue sections, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were reviewed onsite by an outside pathologist, followed by outside study that included tissue microarray immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local pathology laboratory procedures were inconsistent and suboptimal, especially for tissue fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 88 clinically presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three could be reviewed by outside pathology (25 cases of lost blocks or no remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) and showed a clinical diagnostic accuracy of 75% (47 confirmed of 63), with a possible range of 62% to 85%, depending on the actual diagnosis of the 25 nonevaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 64 BL cases diagnosed by local pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-five could be reviewed by outside pathology (19 cases of lost blocks or no remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>) and showed a local pathology diagnostic accuracy of 82% (37 confirmed of 45), with a possible range of 58% to 88%, depending on the actual diagnosis of the 19 nonevaluable cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> diagnoses included other non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and benign infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was reduced by inclusion of other diseases with similar clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local pathology, using <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone, only marginally improved clinical accuracy and often could not support outside pathology review due to inadequate laboratory procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to improve pathology services in Uganda before conducting high-quality clinical and epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
