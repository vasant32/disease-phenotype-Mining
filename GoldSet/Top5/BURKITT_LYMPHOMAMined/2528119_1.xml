<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the possibility of developing TCR gamma delta bearing T cell lines from peripheral blood of 2 leukemic patients in complete remission in order to study their ability to kill autologous leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T lymphocyte clones are obtained by limiting dilution of lymphocytes from the blood of patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The T cell clones are first selected for their CD8- CD4-phenotype and then for their ability to react with the monoclonal antibody anti-CD3 without presenting reactivity with a monoclonal antibody directed against the TCR alpha beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further biochemical studies have indicated that the CD3 associated structure expressed on the cell membrane of these T cell clones is a gamma delta heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis have indicated that these cloned cells are able to kill in a classical cell mediated lysis assay the autologous leukemic cells only when also LAK activity is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thanks to this clonal expansion 10(10) cells/week indefinitely only 1 sample of peripheral blood will be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Would these results be found with other leukemic patients, we propose to use this procedure for a possible application of killer cells for maintenance therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
