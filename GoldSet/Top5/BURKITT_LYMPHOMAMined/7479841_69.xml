<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA-1 gene promoter for the restricted Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency program operating in group I Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines was previously identified incorrectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present evidence from RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cloning, reverse transcription-PCR, and S1 nuclease analyses, which demonstrates that the EBNA-1 gene promoter in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines is located in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> BamHI Q fragment, immediately upstream of two low-affinity EBNA-1 binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcripts initiated from this promoter, referred to as Qp, have the previously reported Q/U/K exon splicing pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Qp is active in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines but not in group III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines or in EBV immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, transient transfection of Qp-driven reporter constructs into both an EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line and a group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line gave rise to correctly initiated transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inspection of Qp revealed that it is a TATA-less promoter whose architecture is similar to the promoters of housekeeping genes, suggesting that Qp may be a default promoter which ensures EBNA-1 expression in cells that cannot run the full <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the genetic mechanism responsible for the EBNA-1-restricted program of EBV latency is an essential step in understanding control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
