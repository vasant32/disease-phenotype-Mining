<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to design such a schedule, 49 courses of intra-Ommaya MTX (median dose, 6 mg) administered to 12 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a fluorescence polarized immunoassay (TDx; Abbott, Dallas, TX), the median peak intraventricular CSF MTX concentration (CSF [MTX]) was 423 mumol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median CSF [MTX] at 24 hours was 4.6 mumol/L, and at 48 hours was 1.05 mumol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median MTX half-life (t1/2) was 5.7 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A CSF [MTX] greater than 1 mumol/L was maintained for 24 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one course and for 48 hours in half of the courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between MTX dose, patient age, [MTX], t1/2 or prior therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considerable intra- and interpatient variability was seen in MTX disposition, emphasizing the need to monitor [MTX] with each course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A schedule for intraventricular MTX with an initial dose of 6 mg and supplemental doses of 6, 4, or 2 mg at 24 and 48 hours according to serial measurements of intraventricular [MTX] should be initiated to provide a minimum CSF [MTX] of 1 mumol/L for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
