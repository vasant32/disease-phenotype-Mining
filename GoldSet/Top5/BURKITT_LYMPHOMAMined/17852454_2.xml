<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocations associated with this syndrome result in the fusion of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR 1) gene with various partners, resulting in ligand independent FGFR activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most commonly observed translocation of this syndrome is t(8;13), which results in the expression of a chimeric ZNF198-FGFR1 tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease phenotype associated with this translocation has some typical features such as poor prognosis, and transformation to mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; commonly with a T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in which obtaining and maintenance of remission is difficult by conventional chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hereby present a case diagnosed as atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> with consistent t(8;13)(p12;q12) and transformed rapidly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004812'>pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> which is a rare clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
