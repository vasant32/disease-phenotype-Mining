<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> data for 1970 through 1978 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During those years, the registrations increased from 200 to 600 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this increase and the patterns of reporting over the entire 21-year period are examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data offered us opportunities to examine changes in case findings according to geography, time, and sex </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the emergence from isolation, profound socioeconomic changes are occurring in this country; the patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> must change also, and we may be seeing the beginning of this already </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible fruitful areas for further detailed studies are indicated </plain></SENT>
