<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro culture system comprised of irradiated Daudi cells as stimulators and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes as responders, the cellular determinants of this response were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 1-1C4, L243, and 9.3F10) directed against disparate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, as well as a mAb with specificity for CD4 (OKT4), inhibited the expansion of gammadelta T cells in response to Daudi cell stimulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>mAbs with a specificity for CD74 and CD8 were non-inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> experiments demonstrated a critical role for the CD4+ T-cell subset in the expansion of gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other data pointed towards requirements for direct cell contact in this system, and the addition of exogenous recombinant interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-12 failed to reconstitute gammadelta T-cell expansion in CD4+ lymphocyte-depleted cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results complement previous findings in murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> and mycobacterial systems, providing a direct demonstration that CD4+ T cells play a role in gammadelta T-cell expansion through an interaction with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II on Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data point towards important functional links between the acquired and natural immune systems </plain></SENT>
