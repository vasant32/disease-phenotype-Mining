<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 3 years 114 cases have been confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on evaluation of pathologic materialy submitted to ABLR pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarities between American and African patients included abrupt clinical presentation with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, jaw, gonads, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and an apparent high cure rate distinguish American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcoma</z:e>) of childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time-space clustering and absence of cases in high-altitude regions are seen in American and African patients; young American patients resemble Africans in a predominance of men and high Epstein-Barr virus titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>American patients have bone-marrow and peripheral lymph-node involvement more frequently and are less likely to have Epstein-Barr virus genome in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; most are white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of specific causal factors requires the study of more cases and better pretreatment material for pathologic review </plain></SENT>
