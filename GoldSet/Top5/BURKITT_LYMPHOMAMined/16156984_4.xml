<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study aimed to compare the geographical distribution of recent cases and their anatomical site of presentation with findings from previous studies, and to determine survival using the current treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Burkitt and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children up to 14 years of age diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six children were diagnosed with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, accounting for 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 13% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 6 years (interquartile range 4-8 years) and the male:female ratio was 8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Facial structures were the most commonly affected sites, accounting for 21 (58%) cases, followed by spinal involvement in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (89%) of patients came from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e>-holo-endemic, coastal PNG and three were from the highland region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The national incidence was 1.7/100,000 but provincial rates varied, the highest of 13.4/100,000 being in Gulf province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two of the 16 patients who received chemotherapy were known to be in remission at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumour</z:e> remains a common childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in PNG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a need to improve diagnosis and reporting so that treatment can be started early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most appropriate treatment regimen for use in PNG and other resource-poor countries remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
