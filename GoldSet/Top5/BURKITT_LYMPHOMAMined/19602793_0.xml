<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> after melphalan and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> therapy and abruptly died with a rapid clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis of bone marrow showed complex abnormalities including a variant Burkitt-type translocation, t(2;8)(p12;q24), but the patient had IgG-lambda type M-proteinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although patients with MM associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> have been sporadically reported and their prognosis is poor, specific chromosomal abnormalities in the lesion have not been well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, important to accumulate such patients to find a possible relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>hyperammonemia</z:hpo> and chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
