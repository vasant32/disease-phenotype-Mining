<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This second binding protein can be distinguished from the G.T binding activity by its size, substrate specificity, and its fractionation properties </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that this novel activity is involved in a broad specificity DNA repair pathway for the correction of single base mismatches in human cells </plain></SENT>
