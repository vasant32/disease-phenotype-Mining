<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>XLP was first described in 1975, when EBV was still focused on as an immediate oncogenic agent, but with some uncertainties raised by the absence of EBV in most non-endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The discovery of XLP refreshingly evidenced and popularized the concept, "EBV pathogenicity (oncogenicity) in immunocompromised hosts", which was later vastly substantiated by EBV-carrying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in organ-transplanted and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fatal (or severe) IM, acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> (AH) and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (MH) are 3 major phenotypes in XLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fatal IM occurs in 2/3 with a mortality rate of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte infiltration (T cells and EBV-positive B cells) followed by their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> with the appearance of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> in the bone marrow leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematocytopenia</z:e>, ML, AH and ML with AH usually occur after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, but can occur before it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reactivation pattern of EBV serology (high VCA, high EA, low EBNA), impaired generation of EBV-specific killer cell (poor regression), lowered NK activity, lowered 4/8 ratio and failure to mount IgG response to phi X174 have been recorded in XLP and carrier females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these are also found in non-XLP congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> as well as acquired immunodeficient states like advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to record XLP-specific defects, impaired help of autologous Ia-stimulated T4 cells or exaggerated suppression by T cells exposed to MA-pulsed macrophages is now being tested (Purtilo, personal communication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fewer V region genes of T receptor may be a possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) by using probes from X chromosome may substantiate the precise genetics of this disease </plain></SENT>
