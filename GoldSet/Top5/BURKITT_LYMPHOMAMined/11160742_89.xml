<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the immediate-early proteins of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are known to modify promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (PML) (ND10) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell, it has been unclear whether lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PML protein is induced by interferon, involved in major histocompatibility complex class I presentation, and necessary for certain types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMO-1 modification of PML is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To examine whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies, we expressed the EBV immediate-early genes BZLF1 (Z) and BRLF1 (R) in EBV-positive cell lines and examined PML localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both Z and R expression resulted in PML dispersion in EBV-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z requires a portion of the transcriptional activation domain of Z but not the DNA-binding function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As was previously reported for the HSV-1 ICP0 and CMV IE1 proteins, Z reduces the amount of SUMO-1-modified PML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that Z itself is SUMO-1 modified (through amino acid 12) and that Z competes with PML for limiting amounts of SUMO-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Z may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO-1 modification </plain></SENT>
