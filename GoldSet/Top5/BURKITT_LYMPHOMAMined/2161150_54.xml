<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using antibodies specific for each EBNA in immunofluorescence microscopy, EBNA-2, -3A, and -3C localized to subnuclear granules which fill much of the nucleus, excluding nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-LP localized to a small number of discrete subnuclear particles, also excluding nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only EBNA-1 associated with metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, in biochemical nuclear fractionation studies, EBNA-1 was the major chromatin-associated EBNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 also differed from the other EBNAs in the extent of its association with the nucleoplasm and in its lack of nuclear matrix association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA-LP, -2, -3A, and -3C were associated with the nuclear matrix, although they were also found in the nucleoplasm and to a lesser extent in the chromatin fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolic 32Pi-labeling of cells followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that EBNA-LP could be resolved into multiple phosphorylated isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBNA-2 was also phosphorylated and many isoforms were detected by isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
