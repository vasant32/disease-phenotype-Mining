<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human cellular analogue of the v-myc oncogene of avian myelocytomatosis virus, strain MC-29, is known to reside on the distal end of human chromosome 8 and has been observed to translocate to chromosome 14 in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a cDNA clone specific for the transcript of the human c-myc gene (H c-myc), we show that the mouse c-myc (M c-myc) gene is contained within NIARD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NIARD-associated chromosome translocations occurred 1.3-2 kilobases (kb) 5' of the mouse c-myc gene where NIARD recombines with the switch region of the C(alpha) immunoglobulin gene in various murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mouse c-myc encoding region within NIARD spanned &lt;2.4 kb of DNA and expressed a low level of a 2.3-kb polyadenylylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in BALB/c spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased (10- to 20-fold) levels of rearranged mouse c-myc transcripts (i.e., approximately 1.8-2.1 kb) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> that have NIARD-associated chromosome translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human c-myc and NIARD probes detected DNA rearrangements of human c-myc in four of seven Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA sequences adjacent to the human c-myc gene recombined with the C(mu) immunoglobulin gene locus on chromosome 14 in several Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of the c-myc oncogene by chromosome translocation implicates its involvement in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
