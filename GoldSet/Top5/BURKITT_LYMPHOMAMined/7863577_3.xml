<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ileal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were located in the Peyer's patches, along with early involvement of regional lymph nodes, and showed a characteristic pattern of follicular invasion leading to diffuse growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Working Formulation, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were classified as diffuse, large, noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was a diffuse, mixed, small to large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> featured numerous intermingled "starry sky" histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells tended to infiltrate into the muscular layer of the ileum in an "Indian file" pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cases also showed transserosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> into the abdomen and leukemic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells showed membrane positivity for alkaline phosphatase and diffuse cytoplasmic staining for acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins were demonstrated in nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> (IgM-lambda in seven, IgG-lambda in one, and IgG-kappa in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the areas of follicular invasion, an attenuated network of follicular dendritic cells was visualized via an antiserum against the beta subunit of S-100 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructurally, strands of dilatated rough endoplasmic reticulum and scattered or clustered dense bodies were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared with feline and human alimentary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the present <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> possessed distinctive features, such as originating in Peyer's patches, transserosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and predominantly large B cell type with IgM-lambda type immunoglobulin expression, although some features were similar </plain></SENT>
