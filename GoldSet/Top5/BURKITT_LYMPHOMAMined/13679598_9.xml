<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The in vivo expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI-A rightward transcripts (BARTs) as well as the putative BART-encoded BARF0 and RK-BARF0 proteins in various EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RT-PCRs specific for the different splice variants of the BARTs and both a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay and an RT-PCR specific for the BARF0 ORF were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abundant transcription of BARTs was found in EBV-associated Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), T-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, post-transplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in situ hybridization (RISH), BARTs were detected within the neoplastic cells of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BARTs encoding RK-BARF0 were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BARTs detected were shown possibly to encode the RPMS1 and BARF0 proteins, based on their splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, BARTs actually harbouring the BARF0 ORF were detected only in specimens containing a relatively large number of EBV-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New monoclonal antibodies against the BARF0 protein were generated that efficiently recognized prokaryotic and eukaryotic recombinant BARF0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the BARF0 protein was not detected in clinical samples, nor in EBV-positive cell lines, even though these were positive for BARTs by RISH and/or BARF0 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in vitro analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using immunoblot analysis, no antibodies against baculovirus-expressed BARF0 protein were detected in the sera of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> patients, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> patients or EBV-positive healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, BARTs containing the BARF0 ORF are expressed in vivo but the BARF0 protein cannot be detected and may be expressed only marginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the BARF0 protein is unlikely to play a role in vivo in EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
