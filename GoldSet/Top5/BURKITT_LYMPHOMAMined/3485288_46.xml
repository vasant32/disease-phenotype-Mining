<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four antigens were detected in EBV-carrying cell lines and in B lymphocytes early after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the transforming B95-8 substrain of virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were not found in uninfected cells, nor could they be demonstrated with sera lacking antibodies to EBV antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four antigens were nuclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each of them varied in size in the different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two antigens with the lowest molecular weight were identified as EBV-determined nuclear antigens (EBNAs) 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two high molecular weight antigens (140-160 kDa and 150-180 kDa, respectively) were detected with 6 of 16 EBV antibody-positive sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These proteins appeared to be antigenically unrelated to each other and to EBNAs 1 and 2 and were designated EBNAs 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Like EBNAs 1 and 2, they bound to double- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
