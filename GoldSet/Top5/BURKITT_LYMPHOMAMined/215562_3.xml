<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differences could be related to an "internal selection" caused by the cytopathic P3HR-1 virus variant, favouring the growth of receptor-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now analyzed the same lines for the expression of a B-lymphocyte-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (gp27/35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A close parallellism was found between the expression of the EBV receptor-complement receptor complex and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, measured by quantitative absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results favour a relationship between gp27/35 and EBV/C3 receptor expression </plain></SENT>
