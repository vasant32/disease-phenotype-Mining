<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also recorded here are our updated procedures for growing stock cultures and protocols to harvest fluids containing biologically active virus which is infectious or transforming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various methods of concentrating biologically active Epstein-Barr virus have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular debris can be removed efficiently and rapidly from culture harvest fluids by clarification through a JCF-Z continuous-flow rotor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficient and reliable virus concentration was achieved by molecular filtration with Millipore Pellicon cassettes, using flow rates to 10 liters/h to produce fivefold concentrates followed by pelletization in a fixed-angle rotor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from recent production lots showed an average infectivity titer for P3HR-1 virus of 10(4.5) early antigen units per ml (100-fold concentrate) and 10(5.7) transforming units per ml (200-fold concentrate) for B95-9 virus lots </plain></SENT>
