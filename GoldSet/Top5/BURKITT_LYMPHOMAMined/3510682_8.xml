<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi>-labeled Daudi lymphoblasts were mixed with bone marrow mononuclear cells in a model system, and removal of Daudi cells was quantitatively assessed with an inverted fluorescent microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment using the biotinylated monoclonal antibody 2H7 reactive with Bp32 antigen (expressed on Daudi cells) followed by passage over avidin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> produced greater than two logs of Daudi cell removal from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An alternative method was tested by treating cells successively with nonbiotinylated monoclonal antibody and biotinylated goat antimouse immunoglobulin followed by passage over avidin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to three logs of Daudi cells could be eliminated from bone marrow with quantitative recovery of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of biotinylated goat antimouse immunoglobulin eliminates the need to prepare a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> conjugate of each individual monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical application of cellular immunoadsorption using the avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> system may prove useful in bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
