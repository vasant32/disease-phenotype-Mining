<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We set out to analyze the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> occurring in East Africa, a region characterized by a high KSHV/HHV-8 seroprevalence rate and endemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, in endemic regions of Africa, KSHV/HHV-8 is predominantly associated with KS, independently of HIV status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the course of this study, other important information came to light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found the presence of KSHV/HHV-8 in 2 cases of lymph nodes partially involved by Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and KS and in 1 case of multicentric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GLNH|AFLH">Castleman disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our immunophenotypic and molecular data seem to suggest 2 different mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are at work in lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On one hand, when B cells show a latent phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with KSHV/HHV-8, after the germinal center reaction, naive B cells become resting memory B cells, similarly to Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when lytic genes such as vIL6 are expressed in naive B cells, they may be driven to differentiate into plasmablasts without undergoing germinal center reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among KSHV/HHV-8-positive cases, in those in which there was also <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the neoplastic cells were negative for KSHV/HHV-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This further confirms that KSHV/HHV-8 is involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> of only certain types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, probably in relation to their precursor infected cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the maturation stage of KSHV/HHV-8-positive B cells as well as the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may well determine the morphological, phenotypic, and clinical characteristics of KSHV/HHV-8-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
