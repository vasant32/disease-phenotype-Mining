<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether aberrant expression promotes B cell transformation, we generated a murine model in which a TCL1 transgene was overexpressed at similar levels in both B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, transgenic mice developed Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>) and diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) with attendant Bcl-6 expression and mutated J(H) gene segments at a very high penetrance beginning at 4 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one mouse developed a T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> at 15 months, consistent with a longer latency for transformation of T cells by TCL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activation of premalignant splenic B cells by means of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement resulted in significantly increased proliferation and augmented AKT-dependent signaling, including increased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transgenic spleen cells also survived longer than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> spleen cells in long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together these data demonstrate that TCL1 is a powerful oncogene that, when overexpressed in both B and T cells, predominantly yields mature B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
