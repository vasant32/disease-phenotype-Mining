<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In chromosome translocations characteristic of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, c-myc genes become juxtaposed to immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) sequences, resulting in aberrant c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocated c-myc alleles that retain the first exon exhibit increased transcription from the normally minor c-myc promoter, P1, and increased transcriptional elongation through inherent pause sites proximal to the major c-myc promoter, P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that a cassette derived from four DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS1234) in the 3'Calpha region of the IgH locus functions as an enhancer-locus control region (LCR) and directs a similar pattern of deregulated expression of linked c-myc genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the HS1234 enhancer-LCR mediates a widespread increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation along linked c-myc genes in Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the increase in acetylation was not restricted to nucleosomes within the promoter region but also was apparent upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites as well as along vector sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">Histone</z:chebi> hyperacetylation of control c-myc genes, which was induced by the deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, mimics the effect of the HS1234 enhancer on expression from the c-myc P2 promoter, but not that from the P1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the HS1234 enhancer stimulates transcription of c-myc by a combination of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas HS1234 activates expression from the P2 promoter through a mechanism that includes increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation, a general increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation is not sufficient to explain the HS1234-mediated activation of transcription from P1 </plain></SENT>
