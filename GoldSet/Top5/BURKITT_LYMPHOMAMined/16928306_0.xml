<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made according to FAB and MIC criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that (1) among 119 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, 22 (18.5%) were <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>-AML1 positive and classified as L2 morphological subtype </plain></SENT>
