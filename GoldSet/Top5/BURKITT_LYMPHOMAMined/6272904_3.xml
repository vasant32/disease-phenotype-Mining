<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatic cell hybridization provides a method to examine control of gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of tissue-specific features in hybrids between human promyelocytes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) and human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (P3HR-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hybrid lines, HP-1 and HP-2, and 18 hybrid clones were established and confirmed by karyotype, isozyme, and surface antigen analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hybrids extinguished the 10 myeloid (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60) features that we examined including myeloid <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, histochemistry, and functions that included response to colony-stimulating factor and ability to differentiate to granulocytes or macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the hybrids synthesized immunoglobulin and expressed Epstein-Barr nuclear, early, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigens similar to the P3HR-1 lymphoid parental line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results are contrasted to the findings when P3HR-1 lymphocytes are fused to human erythroid-myeloid cells (K562) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that phenotypic differences between human myeloid and lymphoid cells in the hematopoietic lineage involve mutually exclusive programs and may possibly be mediated by the activity of diffusible, transacting molecules </plain></SENT>
