<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed day-to-day variations of lymphocyte marker expression by cultured lines and, occasionally, differences between fresh and cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In L3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, a wide range of phenotypes, including pre-B cell and mature monoclonal IgM + IgD positive B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp>, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most often, the cells expressed high-density monoclonal surface IgM without IgD and lacked IgG Fc, complement and Epstein-Barr virus receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blast cells from rare patients featured monoclonal IgG or IgA instead of IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with light chains of the lambda type were more frequent than those with kappa chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal immunoglobulins were found in serum or urine from eight of 20 patients studied </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the study of both fresh and cultured cells, we demonstrated a correlation between variant chromosomal translocations and light-chain types, the cells from patients with a t(2;8) translocation expressing kappa and those with a t(8;22) expressing lambda chains, with one exception Vimentin expression was absent or weak in most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> studied (lines or fresh cells) and in cells from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023003" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TRPS2">Langer-Giedion syndrome</z:e>, in contrast to most other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
