<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Calcium signaling plays an important role in B lymphocyte survival and activation, and is critically dependent on the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>-1,4,5-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">tris</z:chebi>-phosphate-induced release of calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calcium is accumulated in the ER by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPases (SERCA enzymes), and therefore these enzymes play an important role in ER calcium homeostasis and in the control of B of cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can immortalize B cells and contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, in this work the effects of the virus on SERCA-type calcium pump expression and calcium accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of B cells was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium transport ATPase isoforms, the low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-affinity SERCA3, and the high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-affinity SERCA2 enzymes are simultaneously expressed in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Latency type III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with immortalization-competent virus expressing the full set of latency genes selectively decreased the expression of SERCA3 protein, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with immortalization-deficient virus that does not express the EBNA2 or LMP-1 <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes was without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-modulation of SERCA3 expression could be observed upon LMP-1, but not EBNA2 expression in cells carrying inducible transgenes, and LMP-1 expression was associated with enhanced resting cytosolic calcium levels and increased calcium storage in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly to virus-induced B cell immortalisation, SERCA3 expression was also decreased in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells undergoing activation and blastic transformation in germinal centers of lymph node follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data presented in this work indicate that EBV-induced immortalization leads to the remodelling of ER calcium homeostasis of B cells by LMP-1 that copies a previously unknown <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> phenomenon taking place during antigen driven B cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional remodelling of ER calcium homeostasis by down-regulation of SERCA3 expression constitutes a previously unknown mechanism involved in EBV-induced B cell immortalisation </plain></SENT>
