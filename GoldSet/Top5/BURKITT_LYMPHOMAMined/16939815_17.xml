<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are ex vivo expanded cells enriched in CD3(+)CD56(+) natural killer T (NKT) cells with major histocompatibility-unrestricted cytotoxicity against several tumoral targets, except B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We redirected CIK cells cytotoxicity toward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> with a chimeric receptor specific for the CD19 antigen and then explored if modified-CIK cells maintain the same chemotactic properties of freshly isolated NKT cells, whose trafficking machinery reflects their preferential localization into the sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: CIK cells were expanded ex vivo for 21 days and analyzed for expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and chemokine receptors regulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and homing toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-infiltrated tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CIK cells were then transduced with the anti-CD19-zeta-internal ribosomal entry site-green fluorescent protein retroviral vector and characterized for their cytotoxicity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells in a (51)Cr-release assay and for their trafficking properties, including chemotactic activity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and transendothelial migration, and metalloproteases-dependent invasion of Matrigel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similarly to freshly isolated NKT cells, CD49d and CD11a were highly expressed on CIK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CIK cells expressed CXCR4, CCR6, and CCR7 (mean expression 72%, 60%, and 32%, respectively), presenting chemotactic activity toward their respective ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD19 chimeric receptor-modified CIK cells became cytotoxic against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells (mean lysis, 60%) and showed, after exposure to a CXCL12 gradient, high capacity to adhere and transmigrate through endothelial cells and to invade Matrigel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The potential capacity to localize into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-infiltrated tissues of anti-CD19 chimeric receptor-redirected CIK cells, together with their ability to efficiently kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells, suggests that modified-CIK cells represent a valuable tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
