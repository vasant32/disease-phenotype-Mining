<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transformed immunoblasts may grow up as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in immuno-suppressed hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In order to identify cellular protein targets that may be involved in Epstein-Barr virus mediated B-cell transformation, human LCL cDNA library was screened with one of the transformation associated nuclear antigens, EBNA-3 (also called EBNA-3A), using the yeast two-hybrid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clone encoding a fragment of a novel human protein was isolated (clone 538) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction was confirmed using in vitro binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full-length cDNA clone (F538) was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence alignment with known proteins and 3D structure predictions suggest that F538 is a novel human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> kinase/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GFP-F538 fluorescent fusion protein showed a preferentially cytoplasmic distribution but translocated to the nucleus upon co-expression of EBNA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A naturally occurring splice variant of F538, that lacks the C-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase part but maintain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> kinase domain, did not translocate to the nucleus in the presence of EBNA3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibody that was raised against the bacterially produced GST-538 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in EBV negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> but gave a predominantly nuclear staining in EBV positive LCL-s and stable transfected cells expressing EBNA-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that EBNA-3 by direct protein-protein interaction induces the nuclear accumulation of a novel enzyme, that is part of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> salvage pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased intranuclear levels of UK/UPRT may contribute to the metabolic build-up that is needed for blast transformation and rapid proliferation </plain></SENT>
