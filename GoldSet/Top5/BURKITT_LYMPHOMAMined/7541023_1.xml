<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the mechanism of this inhibition in BL41 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>-dependent inhibition is not restricted to the BCR-mediated functions, as evidenced by the failure of the same cells to mobilize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> in response to CD19 cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, calcium response induced by a putative syk activator, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, exhibited only a moderate sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>, demonstrating that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> did not cause general suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the functions leading to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCR cross-linking or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> treatment leads to the induction of almost complete non-responsiveness for the reciprocal stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since BCR cross-linking did not generate non-responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>-treated cells remained responsive to syk activation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, we suppose that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> may inhibit BCR-mediated signal transduction events upstream of syk activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This assumption was supported by additional data, indicating that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> was able to modulate functions of at least 2 different protein tyrosine kinase enzymes involved in BCR-mediated signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> induced rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of lyn and selectively inhibited BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of syk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this paper demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> may provoke cellular desensitization process by alteration of the signal transducer functions of lyn and syk tyrosine kinase enzymes </plain></SENT>
