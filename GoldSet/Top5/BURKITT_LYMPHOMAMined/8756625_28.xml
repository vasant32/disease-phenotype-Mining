<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The S box (also known as at the H, W, or Z box) is the 5'-most element of the conserved upstream sequences in promoters of major histocompatibility complex class II genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important for their B-cell-specific and interferon gamma-inducible expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that the S box represents a duplication of the downstream X box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, RFX, which is composed of the RFX5-p36 heterodimer that binds to the X box, also binds to the S box and its 5'-flanking sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, NF-Y, which binds to the Y box and increases interactions between RFX and the X box, also increases the binding of RFX to the S box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, RFXs bound to S and X boxes interact with each other in a spatially constrained manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we confirmed these protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions by expressing a hybrid RFX5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi> protein in cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RFX binds to S and X boxes and that complex interactions between RFX and NF-Y direct B-cell-specific and interferon gamma-inducible expression or major histocompatibility complex class II genes </plain></SENT>
