<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulatory supernatants derived from B cells also exhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity in costimulator assays with the D10.G4.1 helper T cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments with purified macrophage-derived IL-1 and recombinant IL-1 beta demonstrate that IL-1 stimulates proliferation of the cell lines that respond to the factors from B lymphocyte lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One B cell line, Ramos, an EBV-Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, contrasts with other B cell lines in that it is refractory to the growth enhancing effects of B cell conditioned medium and macrophage-derived IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When EBV was introduced into Ramos cells, growth was enhanced by the factor(s) in B cell conditioned medium (six out of seven lines); growth of EBV-converted Ramos lines (six out of seven lines) also was enhanced by IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of a non-responsive transformed B lymphocyte by EBV induces cellular responsiveness to factor-mediated growth stimulation </plain></SENT>
