<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously described deletions and rearrangements in HR-1 cells have been found at sites of EBV replication in vivo, suggesting that DNA rearrangement may be an integral aspect of EBV biology and pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the structure of linear EBV genomes in subcultures of HR-1 cells using contour-clamped homogenous electric field gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a second pulsed electrophoretic technique to separate intracellular circular EBV plasmids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The standard, linear HR-1 EBV genome was approximately 155 kilobases in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear molecules of less than unit length, presumably defective genomes, were seen in numerous subcultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear intracellular genomes greater than 155 kilobases were also detected, but only linear genomes of 155 kilobases or less were packaged into virions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of circular EBV plasmids also varied greatly among HR-1 subcultures, some of which contained two plasmids of different size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progeny of the unusual circular plasmids could be either standard or nonstandard linear genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No aberrant linear or circular form was detected in a subculture carrying the previously described het fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulsed-gel electrophoresis has provided two additional characteristics of mutant EBVs: abnormal linear and circular genome configurations </plain></SENT>
