<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The translocated c-myc oncogene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (MPC) has been proposed to be expressed at a stage of differentiation at which the gene is normally silent, resulting in a continuous proliferation and an inhibited terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
