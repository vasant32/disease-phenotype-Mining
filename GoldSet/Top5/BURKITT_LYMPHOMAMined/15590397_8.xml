<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: p53 status and CD38 antigen are biological factors influencing response to therapy and clinical course in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests the hypothesis that soluble p53 alone and in association with CD38 can <z:mp ids='MP_0003709'>enucleate</z:mp> B-CLL subsets at worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Wild and mutant forms of p53 protein were evaluated in 197 B-CLL patients at diagnosis or before progression by an immunoenzymatic method in plasma using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD38 expression was analyzed by a multicolor flow cytometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher levels of both soluble p53 (sp53) and CD38 were significantly correlated with intermediate and high Rai stages, with higher beta2-microglobulin and soluble CD23 values, determined at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were both observed in sp53+ and CD38+ patients (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous positivity or negativity for sp53 and CD38 identified two subsets of patients, the former with a worse prognosis and the latter with a better prognosis with regard to PFS (p&lt;0.0001) and OS (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of sp53 and CD38 was retained among the patients within the intermediate Rai risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: sp53 and CD38 together with ZAP-70 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With regard to PFS, ZAP-70, sp53 and CD38 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concerning OS, ZAP-70, CD38 and age (&lt; or &gt; 60 years) were independent prognostic factors whereas sp53 showed only a tendency towards statistical significance </plain></SENT>
