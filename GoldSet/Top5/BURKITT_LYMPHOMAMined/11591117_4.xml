<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 exhibited differential effects on CD23 and CD44 expression and binding to hyaluronan in BL30/B95-8, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), and MK3.31, an Epstein-Barr virus transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human B cell line (B-LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this differential effect show that IL-4 induced phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6 in BL30/B95-8 cells and of JAK3 and STAT6 in MK 3.31 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-13 failed to induce the phosphorylation of JAK kinases or STAT6 proteins in these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inability of BL30/B95-8 cells to respond to IL-13 was attributed to the loss of expression of IL-13R subunits alpha1 and alpha2, a finding confirmed for a number of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines examined </plain></SENT>
