<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the EBNA-1 C-terminal region led to the distinction of two major unrelated EBV strains, termed strain P (prototype) and strain V (variant), and their related subtypes, namely P-ala, P-thr, V-leu, V-val, and V-pro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the LMP-1 gene was performed to assess the frequency of the C-terminus deletion variant, whereas analysis of EBNA-2 and EBNA-3C genes led to the identification of the distribution of the EBV type 1 and type 2 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of EBNA-1 subtypes was assessed in 49 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL, including 37 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-DLCL and 12 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P strain was detected in 45 of 49 cases (91.8%) whereas the V strain was found in 4 of 49 samples (8.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in the distribution of the P and V strains was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-DLCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01), because of the exclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by the P strain of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-DLCL samples analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of LMP-1 deletion variants and of EBV type 1 and type 2 strains in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-DLCL overlapped with that of the general population, and no correlation was found with the evaluated clinicoepidemiological data of patients, that is, disease site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology, CD4(+) cell counts, and HIV transmission route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found that the distribution of the EBV genotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL samples analyzed is similar to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> representation found in control individuals of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations </plain></SENT>
