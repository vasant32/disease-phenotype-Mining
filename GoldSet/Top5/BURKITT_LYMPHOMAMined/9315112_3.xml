<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Contradictory reports regarding the ability of complement receptor type 2 (CR2,CD21) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells to activate complement (C') via the alternative pathway (AP), prompted us to compare the performance of human peripheral blood B cells and the Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Raji (a well characterized AP activator) by using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measured in terms of the membrane deposition of C3 fragments per cell, Raji cells were significantly (6- to 26-fold) more effective as complement activators than were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were also found to express approximately four to five times as many CR2 as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, they distinguished themselves by displaying a greater Ca(2+)-dependent activation, with pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human sera (NHS) as the complement source, and by degrading unprotected C3b fragments from iC3b to C3dg/C3d at a significantly lower rate than the B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> dependency of Raji cell activation was found to be partially a result of classical pathway (CP) triggering by specific antibodies in the NHS, although other triggering mechanisms may also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the influence of these variations between Raji cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells was excluded, by relating deposition of anti-C3d-reactive fragments, during AP activation, to the number of CR2 expressed, the difference in performance between the two cell types was found to be insignificant </plain></SENT>
