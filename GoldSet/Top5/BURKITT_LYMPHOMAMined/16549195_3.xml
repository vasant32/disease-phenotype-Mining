<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) is a serious complication of organ transplantation, with a reported incidence between 0.8% and 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PTLD mainly depends on the transplanted organ, the immunosuppressive drugs, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> serology, and the age of the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyze our patients diagnosed with PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 1040 transplantations, including 931 renal, 14 heart, 55 liver and 40 allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC), 8 patients (7 male, 1 female) were diagnosed with PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had undergone renal, one cardiac, one liver, and one PBSC transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were diagnosed within the first year of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients presented with abdominal disease, one with <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, and one with peripheral lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the World Health Organization classification system, six patients were diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one patient Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301361" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polymorphic PTLD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis, 7 patients showed positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) Ig G and negative Ig M; one patient, positive EBV Ig M and negative CMV Ig G and M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load was extremely high in the plasma of two patients by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of these patient's pathologic tissue revealed positive EBV DNA, which was not detected in six of the other eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This patient was an 8-year-old boy diagnosed with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at 31 months after liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died of disease or complications of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one patient survived after the diagnosis of PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, even with treatment the mortality rate was high among our patients with PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To decrease the incidence of PTLD and related mortality, risk factors must be evaluated in multicenter studies </plain></SENT>
