<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) remains one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because MTX and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20612">5-methyltetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> (5CH3THF) share uptake and metabolic pathways, the efficacy of MTX is likely to depend not only on its metabolism but also on how well <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> is accumulated by lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors' goal was to compare in vitro <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and antifolate uptake in B-lineage lymphoblasts from patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR) and those in whom relapse occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four children with B-lineage ALL were studied at diagnosis (n = 20) or relapse (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblasts obtained by bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> were incubated for 24 hours in vitro with 0.05 microM 5CH3[3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> or 1 microM [3H]MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As of July 1999, 16 patients studied at diagnosis remained in CCR at a median follow-up of 45 months after achieving remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients studied at relapse are in second CCR; the remaining two died from progressive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median uptake of neither [3H]MTX nor 5CH3[3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> differed significantly between the 16 patients in first CCR studied at diagnosis and the 4 patients studied at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the median ratio of [3H]MTX:5CH3[3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> uptake differed significantly for patients who remained in first CCR versus patients studied at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of [3H]MTX in relation to 5CH3[3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> by leukemic lymphoblasts in vitro may correlate positively with treatment outcome in children with B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A larger study of homogeneously treated patients is necessary to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
