<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared the kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) by simultaneous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring with oligonucleotides for the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and the T-cell receptor gamma chain gene (TCR gamma), as well as clone-specific CDR3 sequences in adult patients (aged 17-51 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) who entered a complete hematological remission (CR) after chemotherapy with the German multicenter ALL (GMALL) protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities were one in 10(2-3) for the CDR3- and TCR gamma-PCR and one in 10(5-6) for a two-step, seminested CDR3/clone-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 7/7 patients were CDR3 positive and four were TCR gamma positive in their bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of induction therapy (after 2 months) 4/6 tested positive for CDR3, 2/6 for TCR gamma, and 5/6 for clone-specific rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of consolidation treatment (after 7 months) only 1/7 remained positive for CDR3, 2/7 for TCR gamma, and 5/7 for clone-specific rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After an observation period of 18-36 months, 4/7 patients were still in CR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were PCR negative by the clone-specific method during or after maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died in leukemic relapse; one patient relapsed but is still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three of these patients remained PCR positive throughout the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Clonal evolution</z:e> in the IgH locus was found in one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the molecular response to chemotherapy in adult B-lineage ALL is slow, even in patients without risk factors other than age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, most patients with long-term CR convert to PCR negativity approximately 18 months after the start of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest the existence of early clone-specific PCR negativity in a small proportion of long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of this observation will now have to be confirmed in a larger study </plain></SENT>
