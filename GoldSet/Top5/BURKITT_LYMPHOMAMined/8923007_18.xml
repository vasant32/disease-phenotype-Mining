<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an earlier report we showed that the 5' end of the gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> ATM is within 700 bp of the 5' end of a novel gene E14, and suggested that the CpG island that separates these genes functions as a bidirectional promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now determined the complete amino acid sequence of the E14 protein, defined the exon/intron structure of the gene and estimate that the complete gene is more than 55 kb in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The E14 gene appears to be a housekeeping gene that is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The E14/ATM promoter organisation is conserved in man, monkey and mouse, although the mouse promoter is more compact and appears to lack two of the four putative Sp1 boxes found in the human promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reporter gene constructs showed that the human and mouse E14/ATM promoters were indeed bidirectional, that the ATM side of the human promoter was three times stronger than the E14 side, and that the mouse promoter (in human cells) directed transcription with equal efficiency in both directions, but at a lower level than the human promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a small number of A-T patients for mutations in the promoter region or the E14 coding sequence did not provide evidence to suggest that E14 contributes to the A-T phenotype </plain></SENT>
