<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes from EBV-seropositive but not seronegative healthy donors responded with significant migration inhibition to the 48K subcomponent of the Epstein-Barr virus determined nuclear antigen (EBNA), known to carry the virally determined antigenic specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A concentration of 10 micrograms/ml was still effective while 5 micrograms/ml had no detectable effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA-associated cellular 53K protein had no effect by itself, but it potentiated the effect of 48K, even if the latter was added at the subliminal concentration of 5 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The related 53K protein, isolated from EBV-negative human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, was also effective, whereas the corresponding murine-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated 53K had no potentiating effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunization of mice with an extract of DNA-binding proteins from EBV-carrying Raji cells, known to contain both 48K and 53K, induced a significant macrophage migration inhibition response, to both human 48K and 53K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Murine 53K was ineffective, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human but not murine 53K increased the migration inhibitory activity of subliminal concentrations of 48K in the murine macrophage system as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that human but not murine 53K may reconstitute with 48K (EBNA) to form a highly immunogenic complex </plain></SENT>
