<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal IgM antibody (HB-2), produced against a membrane antigen on the Raji, B cell line, reacted by indirect immunofluorescence with 2 to 40% of lymphoblasts from the B cell lines, Raji, Daudi, SN-1036, and SB but not with other types of cell lines, including pre-B, myeloid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, or T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HB-2 antibody reacted with 10 +/- 3% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood mononuclear cells, and was unreactive with monocytes, granulocytes, platelets, or erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-color immunofluorescence revealed that HB-2 antigen expression was confined to cells bearing surface Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An interesting finding was the fact that 25% of plasmablasts induced by pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> also expressed the HB-2 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, pre-B and plasma cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow did not express the HB-2 antigen either on their membrane surface or in their cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 85 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> revealed that the HB-2 antigen was expressed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but not on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of pre-B, T, myelocytic, or plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that expression of the HB-2 antigen is confined to mature B cells </plain></SENT>
