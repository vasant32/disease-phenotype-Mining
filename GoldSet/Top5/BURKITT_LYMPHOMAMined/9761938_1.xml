<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present communication, the effects of the microwave pretreatment (MWP) and that of the proteinase-K enzymatic predigestion (PKD) on EBER <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> oligonucleotide in situ hybridization (EBER-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) (EBER: Epstein-Barr-Encoded-(Early)-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of two EBV detecting methods, latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) immunohistochemistry and EBER-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that microwave pretreatment enhances the intensity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> signals and preserves significantly better the structure of the tissues compared with enzymatic predigestion </plain></SENT>
