<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis underwent central review </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had advanced disease (stages III and IV, or ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease relapsed in five patients (event-free survival 74%, median follow-up 10.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome abnormalities were identified in 18 patients (95%) including t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) in 12 (63%); t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.2) in 1 (5%); partial duplication of 1q in 7 (37%); and 13q32 abnormalities in 2 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients who had relapses, in addition to the t(8;14)(q24. ;q32), two had abnormalities of 13q32 and two had partial duplication of 1q </plain></SENT>
