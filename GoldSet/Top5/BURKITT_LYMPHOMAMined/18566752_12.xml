<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although ionizing radiation activates multiple cellular factors that vary depending on dose and tissue specificity, the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B appears to be a well-conserved response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells exposed to Gamma-IR which can lead to the inhibition of radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation is an important strategy to abolish radioresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA; 22:6 n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may occur via ligand-dependent transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many reports described that activation of PPAR-gamma can lead to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through NF-kappaB inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we addressed the mechanism that NF-kappaB is a downstream target of DHA and may be involved in the process of radiosensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ramos cells are a highly radiation-resistant and p53-deficient Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of present study showed that cotreatment of Ramos cells with low doses of DHA and Gamma-IR leads to marked phosphorylation of IkappaB and translocation of p65/NF-kappaB to nucleus in parallel with increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of the cells with GW9662, a selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for PPAR-gamma, significantly prevented NF-kappaB activation profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that low concentration of DHA inhibited Gamma-IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB and sensitized Ramos cells to IR-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of Ramos cells with GW9662 abrogated the ability of DHA to inhibit Gamma-IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB and diminished the DHA radiosensitizing effect indicating that PPAR-gamma may act as a mediator of DHA in inhibition of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that low concentration of DHA inhibited Gamma-IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB and sensitized Ramos cells to IR-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of Ramos cells with GW9662 abrogated the ability of DHA to inhibit Gamma-IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB and diminished the DHA radiosensitizing effect indicating that PPAR-gamma may act as a mediator of DHA in inhibition of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
