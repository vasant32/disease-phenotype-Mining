<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by our recent report that immunoreactive human PRL (ir-hPRL) is produced by and required for the continuous growth of sfRamos, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> serum-free cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further support for the hypothesis is provided in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data illustrate that antiserum immunoglobulin fraction G (IgG) to synthetic human GH (NIDDK anti-synth hGH IC-4), but not nonimmune serum IgG, completely inhibited sfRamos proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-synth hGH, but not nonimmune serum, identified several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> in sfRamos spent medium that were not in serum-free control medium, as determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) under reducing conditions and the Western immunoblot procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ir-hGH <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were in the 35- to more than 300-kilodalton (kDa) range, with a 48-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> as a major component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> with electrophoretic properties identical to those of the hGH monomer (22 kDa) was not detected, even with prior incubation of spent medium with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi> and dithiothreitol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pituitary preparations of hPRL and hGH, each with the monomer form as the major component, were neither mitogenic for growth-arrested cells nor did they synergize with spent medium to enhance growth, either alone or in combination, whereas spent medium with immunoreactive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> larger than the monomer form markedly stimulated proliferation of growth-arrested cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that sfRamos mitogenesis is potentially regulated by autocrine secretions with cross-immunoreactivity to two anterior pituitary hormones </plain></SENT>
