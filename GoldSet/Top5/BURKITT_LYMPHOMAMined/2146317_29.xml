<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major subset uses the V gamma 9 and the V delta 2 gene segments and the minor subset the V delta 1 gene segments in its functional TCR rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon in vitro activation, these TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes display MHC-unrestricted lytic activity, against a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells of distinct histologic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that fresh TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes that express a V gamma 9-V delta 2 encoded TCR display a specific proliferative response to Daudi, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cloned V gamma 9-V delta 2 lymphocytes show the capacity to lyse Daudi cells, whereas none of the cloned V gamma 1 TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes shows such specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide diversity at the V-D-J junction of the TCR-V delta 2 gene did not contribute to this Daudi cell specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the MHC-unrestricted cytolytic capacities of the V gamma 9-V delta 2 and the V delta 1 clones using a panel of distinct types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cells showed that on average, the level of MHC unrestricted lysis of V gamma 9-V delta 2 clones against these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells exceeded that of V delta 1 clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines, only the Daudi cells showed such an absolute distinction in susceptibility to lysis by V gamma 9-V delta 2 and V delta 1 clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>V gamma 9-V delta 2 clones that were generated with a stimulator cell other than Daudi did not lyse their stimulator cells but nevertheless showed specific cytolysis of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific proliferation to and cytolysis of Daudi cells of the entire V gamma 9-V delta 2 subpopulation of TCR-gamma delta lymphocytes is reminiscent of a superantigen response </plain></SENT>
