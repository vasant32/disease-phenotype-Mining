<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One P3HR1 <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> convertant and 3 out of 4 B95-8 virus-converted sublines had a high (greater than 40%) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> clonability, like the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 41 parent, and were slightly more tumorigenic than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It showed a more drastic shift towards an LCL-like phenotype than the other convertants as reflected by high HLA class-I and EBV-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 41/95 still contains the 8;14 IgH/myc translocation, carried by the parental line, and maintains the same relatively high steady-state level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein as the highly tumorigenic convertants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the tumorigenicity of BL41/95 has been suppressed by a gene that acts at a level beyond the expression of the activated oncogene, in the same way as the <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertants</z:mp> isolated from ras and SV-40-transformed cultures (Klein, 1987b; Bassin and Noda, 1987) </plain></SENT>
