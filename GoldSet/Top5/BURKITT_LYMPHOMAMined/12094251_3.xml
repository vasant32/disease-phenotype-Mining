<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined Fc receptor expression and function in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic human immature B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fc receptor expression increased with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell maturation: CD32(+) cells composed 8.1% +/- 1.2% (mean +/- s.d.) of the least mature (CD34(+)CD10(+)), 19.2% +/- 5.7% of intermediate (CD34(-)CD10(+)), and 82.4% +/- 5.0% of mature (CD34(-)CD10(-)) bone marrow CD19(+) B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five of 57 primary B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> samples and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cell lines studied expressed Fc receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By RT-PCR and antibody staining, FcgammaRIIA was the Fc receptor predominantly expressed in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FcgammaRIIA ligation in RS4;11 and 380 cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD32, CD19, CBL, SYK, P13-K p85 and SHIP, as well as RasGAP association with tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These signalling events resulted in a marked suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a 7-day exposure to anti-CD32, the recovery of ALL cells cocultured with stroma was reduced to 5.5% +/- 2.8% of control values in 380 cells (n = 14), 19.4% +/- 6.1% (n = 8) in RS4;11, and 4.0% +/- 1.3% (n = 6) in KOPN55bi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD32 ligation also reduced cell recovery in five of seven CD32(+) primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, FcgammaRIIA mediates signals that suppress the growth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
