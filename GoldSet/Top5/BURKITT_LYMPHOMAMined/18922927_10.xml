<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Making use of gene expression analysis and, in particular, expression signatures of cell signaling pathway activation, we now show that several forms of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> can be identified in the Emu-myc mice associated with time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, one form of Emu-myc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with pre-B character is shown to resemble human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whereas others exhibit more differentiated B-cell characteristics and show similarity with human diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the pattern of gene expression, as well as oncogenic pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we show that signatures of oncogenic pathway activity provide further dissection of the spectrum of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, identifying a subset of patients who have very poor prognosis and could benefit from more aggressive or novel therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies provide insight into the complexity of the oncogenic process and a novel strategy for dissecting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
