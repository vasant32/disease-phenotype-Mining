<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under test conditions with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15633">dihydrofolic acid</z:chebi> 0.5 X 10(-5) M, triamterene 7 X 10(-5) M produced total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e>, whereas the metabolites hydroxytriamterene and the <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> of hydroxytriamterene were less effective inhibitors; at their maximum attainable concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase was inhibited by 80% and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultures of the BJAB-B95-8 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line were incubated with various concentrations of triamterene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of their increased specific activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase, the cells were able to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA metabolism, as measured by the ratio of the incorporation rates of 3H-deoxyuridine and 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell growth at 1 X 10(-6) M, and in some cases at 1 X 10(-5) M triamterene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 8 X 10(-5) M triamterene, the strong inhibitory effect caused severe impairment of DNA metabolism and subsequently dissolution of the cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed in relation to the possible toxic side effects of long-term triamterene treatment in patients suffering from alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, who may have impaired metabolism of triamterene and a concomitant severe <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
