<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied antibodies to both EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> in children diagnosed with this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study of HIV-seronegative children (&lt;or=15 years) admitted to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were diagnosed with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and controls with non-malignant conditions or non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920571" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphatic cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interviews were conducted and serological samples collected and, when possible, tested for both EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, residential district, household income and tribe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of cases was 7 years and 61% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, cases were more likely to be reported having received more frequent treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> in the past year (OR = 2.0; p = 0.001) and less likely to be living in a home where <z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">insecticides</z:chebi> were used (OR = 0.2; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in children increased with increasing antibody levels against EBV (p &lt; 0.0001) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings were similar for children residing in districts close to the capital city and in remote areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cases were 5 times more likely than controls to have raised levels of both EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> antibodies (OR = 5.0; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that EBV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of childhood Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
