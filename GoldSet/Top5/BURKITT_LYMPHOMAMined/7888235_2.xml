<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of HTLV-II among Pygmies and other populations of Africa has raised doubts as to whether HTLV-II is primarily a New World virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The large serosurveys conducted in the urban and rural areas of southern Ghana have identified a 1-2% prevalence for HTLV-I/II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To define the HTLV type, we have used a Western blot assay (HTLV-2.3 blot) that allows simultaneous confirmation and differentiation between HTLVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples (n = 139) were chosen on the basis of previous reactivity with either an enzyme immune assay or r21e-spiked WB results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WB 2.3 analysis of these specimens identified 55 (40%) to be HTLV positive, 70 (50%) to be HTLV indeterminant, and 14 (10%) to be HTLV negative for HTLV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HTLV seroindeterminant patterns ranged from both gag and env (14 were r21+, p24+, and/or p19+ [<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were RIPA negative]) to gag only (21 were p24+/p19+, 16 were p19+, and 7 were p24+), and env only (8 were r21+ and 4 were rgp46+) reactivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 HTLV-positive specimens, 41 were typed as HTLV-I, 9 were HTLV-II, and 5 could not be typed (HTLV-I/II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the nine HTLV-II-positive specimens, three were from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and six were from healthy individuals (two pregnant women) with no obvious risk factors for HTLV-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
