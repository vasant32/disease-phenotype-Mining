<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Ly66 produces a short mu chain which lacks 4 kDa in apparent molecular mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study of the corresponding <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> showed it to be 0.3 kb shorter than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mu transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cDNA sequence of the mu transcripts began by a short VH region consisting of the first one-third of a VHIV subgroup gene segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was followed by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mu constant region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This VH region coded for 38 amino acids, thus differing from two truncated VHIV regions previously reported in other Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, which were interrupted at codon +26 by an alternate splicing event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Ly66 variable sequence bore several point mutations and contained two potential N-glycosylation sites </plain></SENT>
