<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired function of the activating and inhibitory Fc gamma R may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the modulation of IgG-Fc gamma R interaction can be a target for the development of treatments for some autoimmune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study addresses the localization and functional characterization of linear sequences in human IgG1 which bind to Fc gamma RII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> with overlapping sequences derived from the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29357,29358,29360,29361,51375,51376">CH2</z:chebi> domain of human IgG1 between P(234) and S(298) were synthesized and used in binding and functional experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to Fc gamma R was assayed in vitro and ex vivo, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> found to interact were functionally tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The shortest effective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was T(256)-P(271), which bound to soluble recombinant Fc gamma RIIb with K(d)=6 x 10(6) M(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The biotinylated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> R(255)-P(271) and T(256)-P(271) complexed by avidin exhibited functional activity; they induced Fc gamma RIIb-mediated inhibition of the BCR-triggered Ca(2+) response of human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, and inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-alpha and IL-6) by the human monocyte cell line MonoMac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that the selected <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> functionally represent the Fc gamma RII-binding part of IgG1 </plain></SENT>
