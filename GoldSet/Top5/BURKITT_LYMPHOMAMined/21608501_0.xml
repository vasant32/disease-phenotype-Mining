<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was carried out in two parts: the first, a retrospective record-based study (2005-2007) consisting of 661 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and the second, a prospective study (June 2008 -October 2009) documenting 19 cases of suspected and confirmed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the retrospective study, two thirds presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> at various sites of which the abdomen was the most common site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-9 year age group predominated with an average peak incidence of 7 years and accounted for 60.0% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a male preponderance with a ratio of male to female of 1.6:1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the prospective study, females predominated with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1 and the mandible was the most common site accounting for 19.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The age group 5-9 years predominated with 68.4% relative frequency </plain></SENT>
