<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine cases of Burkitt's type and 5 case of non-Burkitt's type small, non-cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were retrospectively studied to evaluate their clinical and radiological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Burkitt's group, the median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 9 years old; the male to female ratio was 2:1; and the most frequent presentation was abdominal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features conformed to those of non-endemic (or American) type Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the Burkitt's group, less male-predominance (M:F = 2:3) and cervical mass as the most frequent initial symptom were found in the non-Burkitt's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plain films and computed tomographies were collected to evaluate the encroachment of the disease into various organs or compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant correlation in site of the main mass between these two types; the Burkitt's type prefers extranodal, whereas the non-Burkitt's type prefers nodal, involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic appearance of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was also analyzed and summarized by the following five aspects: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location-predominantly in the abdomen or head/neck region; (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> density-rather homogeneous and slightly less than that of muscle; (3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> margin-often well-localized with distinct contrast to adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue; (4) extranodal predilection- the most frequent pattern of involvement; and (5) bony chang-often mild, despite the size of the mass </plain></SENT>
