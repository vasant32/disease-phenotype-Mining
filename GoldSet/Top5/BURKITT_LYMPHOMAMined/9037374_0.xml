<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neuramide, in Italy, is a prescription drug and contains various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, with molecular weights ranging between 10,000 and 1,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is commonly used in Italy for the clinical therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster</z:e> and other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> herpetic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated its effect on the in vitro transformation activity and transformed status of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), ab herpesvirus closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM), nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antiviral effects of neuramide were evaluated on <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-induced immortalization, transformed status and DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that simultaneous and/or post-treatment of EBV-infected lymphocytes with neuramide, at a concentration of 2 inhibiting units (IU)/ml, blocks EBV-mediated transformation and related events, whereas pretreatment does not show any inhibiting activity against EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuramide was also found to be a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of EBV-transformed B lymphocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms of action of the drug should be investigated more closely and also support the necessity to further purify the active <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, in order to improve its possible in vivo efficacy in EBV-associated diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
