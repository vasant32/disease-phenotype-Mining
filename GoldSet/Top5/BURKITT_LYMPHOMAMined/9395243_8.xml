<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The p16/MTS1/CDKN2 gene on human chromosome band 9p21 encodes two unrelated proteins: p16INK4a, a specific inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CKD4 and CDK6, and the structurally unrelated p19ARF protein that arrests cell growth in G1/S and also in G2/M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By use of polyclonal antibodies, the human p19ARF (hp19ARF) protein has been identified in the nucleus of various cells including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of this protein did not fluctuate throughout the cell cycle and was more elevated in fibroblasts with limited or arrested growth, suggesting that p19ARF accumulated in presenescent or senescent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, hp19ARF was not detected in several hemopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines (mainly of B-type lymphoid origin) that expressed abundant amounts of the p16beta transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the expression of hp19ARF <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein may be uncoupled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it suggests that disruption of a translational mechanism may be involved in the inactivation of hp19ARF </plain></SENT>
