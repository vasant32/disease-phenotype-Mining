<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study asks whether the known genotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within and between endemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (eBLs and sBLs, n = 10 each), and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLLs</z:e>, n-12), is reflected in divergent cytokinetics and related immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was strong evidence that eBL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> grow markedly faster than sBL, as shown by differences in mitotic and apoptotic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>, the median percentage of neoplastic cells immunoreactive for the bcl-2 protein was much higher than that observed in eBL and sBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reverse was true for the median fraction of cells containing c-myc protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eBL and sBL, the median fraction of bcl-6 protein-positive cells reached values above 50 per cent, while cells of 8/12 BLLs did not contain detectable amounts of this protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation indicates that in this respect, eBL and sBL resemble <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> germinal centres of lymphatic tissue much more than do <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of neoplastic cells by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was observed in 9/10 cases of eBL and in 3/10 of sBL, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were associated with distinctly lower apoptotic indices and smaller median percentages of bcl-6-positive cells than EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
