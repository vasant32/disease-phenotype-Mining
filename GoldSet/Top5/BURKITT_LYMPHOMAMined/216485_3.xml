<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differences were due to cell response rather than to reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastoid lines were also more sensitive to [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporated along with bromodeoxyuridine than were the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lines showed excision repair activity as measured by the benzoylated napthoylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi> cellulose method, although there were quantitative differences in the activity of different lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most lymphoblastoid lines synthesize DNA of lower density when incubated in analog-containing medium due to their ability to discriminate against bromodeoxyuridine and to select for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in a mixture </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to produce large quantities of dense radioactive, doubly substituted DNA when incubated in medium with bromodeoxyuridine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> is due to their inability to discriminate between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleosides</z:chebi> and to their resistance to incorporated [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
