<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of these two G-proteins varied substantially (alpha 11/alpha q = 0.25-2.5) between the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In human platelets and in a range of haemopoietically derived human cell lines including U937 (monoblasts), Raji (Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and Jurkat (mature T cell) expression of G11 alpha was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was not due to the inability of the antiserum to identify human G11 alpha as other human cell lines co-expressed both G-proteins </plain></SENT>
