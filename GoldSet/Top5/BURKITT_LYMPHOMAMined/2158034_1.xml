<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the presence of the EBV receptors using radiolabelled EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was determined that similar amounts of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived P3HR-1 or NPC-KT-derived EBV can attach <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived Raji cells, but that only P3HR-1 virus can attach to NPC-KT cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji cells adsorbed with OKB7 became much less susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with P3HR-1 or NPC virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that EBV receptors unrelated to C3d receptor exist </plain></SENT>
