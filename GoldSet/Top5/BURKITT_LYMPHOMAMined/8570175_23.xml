<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, called B-ATF, has been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus stimulated human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-ATF is a 125 amino acid nuclear protein possessing a basic leucine zipper domain that is most similar to the basic leucine zipper of ATF-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolated from a variety of human tissues and established cell lines indicates that the 1.0 kilobase B-ATF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed differentially, with the strongest hybridization detected in lung and in Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficient homodimerization of the B-ATF protein cannot be detected using the yeast two hybrid system or using in vitro binding assays with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-s-transferase-B-ATF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17306">maltose</z:chebi> binding protein-B-ATF fusion proteins produced in E. coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a yeast two hybrid library screen has identified the human oncoprotein JunB as a specific binding partner for B-ATF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi>-s-transferase-B-ATF heterodimerizes efficiently with in vitro translated JunB, c-Jun, and JunD, but only weakly associates with c-Fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that a B-ATF/c-Jun protein complex can interact with DNA containing a consensus binding site for AP-1, suggesting that B-ATF functions as a tissue-specific modulator of the AP-1 transcription complex in human cells </plain></SENT>
