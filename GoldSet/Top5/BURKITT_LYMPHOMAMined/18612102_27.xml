<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was open to patients with an aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with an MKI67 fraction approaching 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to separate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from other aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was characterized by the presence of a cMYC rearrangement as a sole cytogenetic abnormality occurring in patients with a germinal center phenotype with absence of BCL-2 expression and abnormal TP53 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 128 patients were eligible for the study, of whom 58 were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and 70 to have diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 110 clinically fit patients who received dmCODOX-M (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, dose 3 g/m(2)) with or without IVAC according to risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2-year progression-free survival was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51%-77%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 55% (95% CI 42%-66%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, 85% (95% CI 73%-97%) for low risk, and 49% (95% CI 38%-60%) for high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed differences in outcome and other clinical features validate the proposed diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the previous trial LY06 with full-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (6.7 g/m(2)), there was a reduction in toxicity with comparable outcomes </plain></SENT>
