<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the cells with OKB-7 inhibited the binding of C3, whereas pretreatment with HB-5 inhibited the binding of C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the cells coated either with OKB-7 or HB-5 bound high amounts of C3d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated cells showed binding for C3b and weak binding for C3 and C3d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data suggest that Raji cells may express three binding sites for C3, C3b and C3d which can be differently modulated by anti-CR2 MoAbs and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
