<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The configuration of the MYC gene in diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (DLCL) with translocations involving band 8q24 [t(8q24)] has not been systematically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We collected cytogenetic and clinical data on 171 consecutive cases of DLCL, including cleaved, noncleaved, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> types, of which 96 had DNA available and 124 had abnormal karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases with DNA available were evaluated for MYC rearrangement (MYC-R) by Southern hybridization of EcoRI-digested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA using an exon-1 probe, a combination of probe and enzyme known to detect over 85% of breaks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases studied at diagnosis, MYC-R, t(8;14)(q24;q32), or other t(8q24) were not prognostically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 124 cases with karyotypic abnormalities, seropositivity for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus was significantly more common in cases with a t(8q24) (72%) than in cases without it (9%) (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the four cases with an MYC -R, two had a t(8;14), one had a t(7;8;14)(p15;q24;q32), and one had a t(8;?)(q24;?) and a del(8)(q24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the three previous cases with translocations involving 8q24 and 14q32, comigration of the rearranged MYC band with either the J region or the switch-mu region of the Ig heavy chain gene could not be demonstrated, leaving the 14q32 breakpoint undefined at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the remaining 72 cases where both an abnormal karyotype and molecular data were available, 11 had a t(8q24), either t(8;14) or t(8;22)(q24;q11), in the absence of an MYC-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the 8q24 break was presumably located outside of the EcoRI MYC fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 15 cases with a t(8q24) were also screened for point mutations in the PvuII site in the first exon of MYC; two cases that were not MYC-R showed loss of this restriction site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in most DLCL with t(8;14) or other t(8q24), the 8q24 breakpoint lies away from the MYC gene; in a minority of these cases, point mutations in regulatory noncoding regions were detected </plain></SENT>
