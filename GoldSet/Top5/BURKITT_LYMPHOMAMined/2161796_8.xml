<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The open reading frame corresponding to BORF2 and encoding the large subunit of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase has been inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pUC19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 90-kDa protein was produced when the intact plasmid was used as a template for in vitro DNA-directed protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using templates generated by restriction digests within the BORF2 open reading frame, in the same system, truncated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> resulted confirming the identity of the 90-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein was then produced in a heterologous expression system and used in protein immunoblotting to screen for antibodies in sera from nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) or control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 33 NPC sera were positive for antibodies against the large subunit, 13 of these were positive for both IgG and IgA, whilst 7 were positive for IgG only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 15 BL sera and 10 control sera, none were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those observed for other EBV-encoded enzymes, including the DNase which had been used as an early marker for the development of NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results presented here indicate that antibodies against the large subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase could serve as an additional marker for NPC </plain></SENT>
