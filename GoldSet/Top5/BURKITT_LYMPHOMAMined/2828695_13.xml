<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> share other epidemiological characteristics as well, including multiple histological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, higher rates of occurrence in white, urbanized populations and upper social classes, relative infrequency among black populations, low but definite familial occurrence and an early geographically acquired lifetime risk irrespective of later migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both diseases are increasing in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This epidemiological similarity suggests exposure to an infectious agent early in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus is known to be oncogenic and neonatal exposure with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is believed to be associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in African children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High titers of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen also have been reported in a series of studies comparing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular cancer</z:e> is epidemiologically similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and, therefore, might be expected to manifest similar Epstein-Barr virus findings, we performed a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> screen (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A and B viruses) on blood samples from 56 consecutive patients with clinical stage I <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumors</z:mpath> of the testis who had received no active therapy after orchiectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show a high incidence (80 per cent) of previous exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and support the hypothesis of a possible infectious origin for testicular <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
