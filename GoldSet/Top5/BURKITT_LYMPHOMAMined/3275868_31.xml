<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of two such clones revealed a 1,587-base-pair-long open reading frame which predicted the primary amino acid sequence of the c-fgr translational product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homology of this protein with the v-fgr translational product stretched from codons 128 to 516, where 32 differences among 388 codons were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence similarity with human c-src, c-yes, and fyn translational products began at amino acid position 76 of the predicted c-fgr protein and extended nearly to its C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the stretch of 75 amino acids at the N-terminus demonstrated a greatly reduced degree of relatedness to these same proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To verify the deduced amino acid sequence, antibodies were prepared against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> representing amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the predicted c-fgr translational product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies specifically recognized a 55-kilodalton protein expressed in COS-1 cells transfected with a c-fgr cDNA expression plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the same protein was immunoprecipitated from an Epstein-Barr virus-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line which expressed c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but not in its uninfected fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-negative counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings identified the 55-kilodalton protein as the product of the human fgr protooncogene </plain></SENT>
