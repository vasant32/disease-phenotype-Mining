<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the reciprocal translocation t(6;7) associated with the spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> of the Louvain rat (RIC) leads to the juxtaposition of myc to the IgH cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10 of 14 tumors investigated the breakpoints on the myc carrying chromosome were clustered in a 1.5 kb region 5' of the intact gene, proximal to the myc promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe the effect of the translocation on myc transcription in the RIC system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Run-on analysis showed transcriptional attenuation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat myc gene, similar to the situation in mice and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The attenuation was almost completely abrogated in the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytomas</z:e> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> failed to reveal any structural changes within exon 1, as found by others in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that the transcriptional initiation of myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is changed in the RICs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In an established line of rat fibroblasts (Rat-2), the more distal myc promoter (P2) is the preferred site of initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In RIC, however, only 30% of transcripts were initiated from P2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that 40% of the transcripts were initiated from P1 and 30% from a novel promoter, designated P1a, located between P1 and P2 </plain></SENT>
