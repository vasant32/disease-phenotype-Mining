<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper an anti-CD74 antibody (Ab), LL1, was covalently attached to the surface of sterically stabilized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> drug-carriers (emulsions and liposomes) by use of a <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-based heterobifunctional coupling agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Target cells internalize LL1 very fast and that was found to be true for the LL1-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> drug-carrier complexes as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a 24 h in vitro incubation with the target Raji B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells about 30% of the added complexes were associated with the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding value for drug-carrier without targeting ligand was near 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Displacement experiments showed that free LL1 competed well with LL1-complexes indicating preserved immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-target cells showed only unspecific association of LL1-complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dioleoylated derivative of the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drug 3',5'-O-dioleoyl-FUdR (FUdR) (FUdR-dO) loaded into LL1-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> drug-carriers showed good cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) cytotoxicity tests against neoplastic B-cells gave IC30 values of 0.45, 1.25, 5.30 and 7.30 microM for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> FUdR-dO in LL1-emulsions, LL1-liposomes, emulsions and liposomes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The value for the parent drug FUdR was calculated to 4.35 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the light of the extensive and specific delivery of LL1-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> drug-carriers to B-cells and the selective cytotoxicity of the incorporated drug, we infer that the complexes may be useful in the selective elimination of circulating malignant B-cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
