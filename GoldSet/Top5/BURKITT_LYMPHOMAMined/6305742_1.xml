<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of lysozyme, neuraminidase and fourteen other glycosidases was investigated in the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Namalva, Raji and Daudi derived from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the lymphoblastoid cell line Robinson from Epstein-Barr virus transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High activity of beta-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-D-glucosaminidase was found in three of the cell lines, which also showed fairly high activities of beta-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-D-galactosaminidase, alpha-D-mannosidase and beta-D-mannosidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Daudi the highest glycosidase activity was found for beta-D-mannosidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuraminidase and lysozyme were not detected in any of the four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cell lines showed characteristic enzyme patterns and enzyme ratios which may be used for the identification of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When calculated on a protein basis no statistically significant change in glycosidase activities of the cells could be recorded during interferon production </plain></SENT>
