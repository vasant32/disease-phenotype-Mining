<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: During the recent period from 1989 to 1995, a total number of 406 cases of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of large intestine were treated at Department of Surgery, Hospital del S.A.S de Jerez de la Frontera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 5 cases of primary colorectal Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, constituting 1.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients were carefully reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical pathology specimens were retrospectively reexamined to confirm the diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry staining methods were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dawson, Cornes and Morson criteria were used to distinguish primary colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, a modification of the Ann-Arbor system for gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> proposed by Musshoff and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schmidt</z:e>-Vollmer was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 2 males and 3 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 12 to 73 years, with an average age of 31 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cecum was the site of the lesions in 4 patients and the other was located in the sigmoid colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> abdomen in three cases, undiagnosed abdominal mass in one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in the other one were the clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inmunohistochemical studies showed B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> in 4 and non-B non-T Ki-1-positive phenotype in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy was administered following resection in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was not suspected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was always present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The cecum is the commonest site of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Both of our two patients presented with perforated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were associated with a poor short term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to unify the staging system and the histologic classifications enabling a comparison of several studies </plain></SENT>
