<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three distinctive groups of patients were identified on the basis of the analysis of blast cells for surface immunoglobulin (SIg), sheep erythrocyte (sE) rosette formation, and complement receptors, The seven group I patients had monoclonal IgM on their blast cells, morphologic features of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, abdominal masses, and very short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 13 group II patients had receptors for sE, complement, or both on their blast cells, mediastinal or nodal masses, and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distinction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> based on the presence of bone marrow involvement at diagnosis is not prognostically useful in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blast cells of group II patients could not be morphologically distinguished from those of the group III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 53 groups III patients had SIG, sE, and complement negative blast cells and could be further subdivided on the basis of while blood cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nine group IIIA patients (greater than 100.0 X 10(9)/liter) had in general short survival, while most of the 44 group IIIB patients (less than than 100.0 X 10(9)/liter) have remained in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive surface markers, mass lesions, male sex, and age of diagnosis less than 2 years of greater than or equal to 10 years appear to be interrelated factors indicating poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated while blood cell count is a prognostic indicator independent of surface marker analysis or presence of mass lesions </plain></SENT>
