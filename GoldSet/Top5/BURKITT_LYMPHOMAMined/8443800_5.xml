<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Matrigel, a solubilized attachment matrix shown to aid growth of anchorage dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, was studied in heterotransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Material for xenografting was derived from 5 patient bone marrow aspirates and 5 cell lines previously established and maintained by intraocular inoculation in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specimens were injected by 3 methods: intraocular (n = 397); s.c. in medium (n = 78); and s.c. in medium supplemented by Matrigel (n = 69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With intraocular injection, 6 of 10 cell sources grew with respective ingraftment rates of 29-76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the conventional s.c. method, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> resulted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of Matrigel produced s.c. ingraftment from 8 of 10 cell sources (ingraftment rate, 50-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotype, histopathology, and karyotype of the cells derived after Matrigel dependent ingraftment correlated with the cells of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Matrigel enables establishment and maintenance of early B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cell growth in a s.c. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
