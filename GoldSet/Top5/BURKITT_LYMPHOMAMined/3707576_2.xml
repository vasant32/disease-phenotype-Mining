<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its biological activity is assigned to the ligand's ability to chelate iron as indicated by the disappearance of its antimitotic properties on iron chelate preformation or on O-methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ligand is shown to have pronounced effects on cell cycle kinetics introducing a G1/S phase block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When treated cells are washed free of the ligand with fresh media they cascade into a high S phase in 5 hrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, after exposure of L1210 cells to vibriobactin (10 microM) for 5 hrs followed by removal of the drug, cells display different doubling times relative to untreated controls, with lower bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation and no apparent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as shown by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects on cell kinetics are consistent with inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, vibriobactin is also shown to be active with a human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Daudi) </plain></SENT>
