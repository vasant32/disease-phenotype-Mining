<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Activation Induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> Deaminase (AID) targets the immunoglobulin genes of activated B cells, where it converts <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> to induce mutagenesis and recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While essential for immunoglobulin gene diversification, AID misregulation can result in genomic instability and oncogenic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is classically illustrated in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which is characterized by AID-induced mutation and reciprocal translocation of the c-MYC oncogene with the IgH loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Originally thought to be B cell-specific, AID now appears to be misexpressed in several epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, raising the specter that AID may also participate in non-B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mutagenic potential of AID argues for the existence of cellular regulators capable of repressing inappropriate AID expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRs) have this capacity, and we have examined the publically available human AID EST dataset for miR complementarities to the human AID 3'UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have evaluated the capacity of two candidate miRs to repress human AID expression in MCF-7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have discovered moderate miR-155 and pronounced miR-93 complementary target sites encoded within the human AID <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays indicate that both miR-93 and miR-155 can interact with the 3'UTR of AID to block expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, over-expression of either miR in MCF-7 cells reduces endogenous AID protein, but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly indicative of AID translational regulation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of either miR in MCF-7 cells increases AID protein levels without concurrent increases in AID <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings demonstrate that miR-93 and miR-155 constitutively suppress AID translation in MCF-7 cells, suggesting widespread roles for these miRs in preventing genome <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminations, mutagenesis, and oncogenic transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, our characterization of an obscured miR-93 target site located within the AID 3'UTR supports the recent suggestion that many miR regulations have been overlooked due to the prevalence of truncated 3'UTR annotations </plain></SENT>
