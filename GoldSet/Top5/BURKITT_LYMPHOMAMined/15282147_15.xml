<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To correlate cell surface markers with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, an antibody microarray prepared by covalently immobilizing antibodies onto a cellulose membrane and subsequent immunocytochemical staining were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The direct binding assay of a lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line on the microarray showed that the immobilized antibody served to capture cells expressing the specific antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The density of bound cells increased linearly with an increasing content of antigen-expressing cells in suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method was further applied to the analysis of surface antigens expressed on neural stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A binding assay was performed with neural cells obtained from the neurosphere culture of the rat fetal striatum on a microarray spotted with eight kinds of antibodies and four different proteins, followed by immunocytochemical staining of cells bound to the microarray using antibodies to the intracellular markers of immature (nestin and vimentin) and mature (beta-tubulin III and glial fibrillary acidic protein) neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, the phenotype of bound cells could be correlated to surface antigen expression, which illustrated the potential of the solid-phase cytometry developed here for the identification of surface markers </plain></SENT>
