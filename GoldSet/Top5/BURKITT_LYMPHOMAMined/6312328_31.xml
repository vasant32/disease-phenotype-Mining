<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e> (WT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>, a chromosomal deletion occurs germinally or somatically and has been considered an important step in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One class of potential cellular transforming genes comprises the cellular homologues of the transforming genes of highly oncogenic retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A remarkable concordance between the chromosomal location of human cellular oncogenes and the breakpoints involved in acquired chromosomal translocations is becoming apparent in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>: the oncogenes c-mos, c-myc and c-abl are located at the breakpoints that occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus when the oncogene c-Ha-ras1 was localized to the short arm of human chromosome 11 (refs 6-8; region 11p11 leads to p15 and not 11p13 as stated in ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5), it was proposed as a possible aetiological agent in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>-WT association (AWTA) that results from a deletion of 11p13 (although a transforming gene recently isolated from a WT cell line (G401) was shown not to be homologous to either c-Ha-ras or c-Ki-ras9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have now looked for deletion or rearrangement of c-Ha-ras1 in the DNA from four subjects with del(11p13)-associated predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumour</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000119'>genitourinary abnormalities</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report here that in no case is c-Ha-ras1 deleted, and we have further refined its location to 11p15.1 leads to 11p15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of enzyme studies and direct gene dosage determination for c-Ha-ras1 and beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> in neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues from one patient, we conclude that deletion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of 11p cannot account for the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
