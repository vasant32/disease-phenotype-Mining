<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>Acute renal failure</z:hpo> (ARF) was investigated to determine the prevalence of ARF clinical types, etiology, comorbidities, and outcome in Nigerian children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive cases of ARF admitted from March, 1994 through February, 2003 were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information were obtained concerning the following: age, gender, body surface area, early (within 48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ARF) or late (&gt;48 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ARF) presentation, admission duration, etiology, comorbidities, urine volume/day, dialysis need, reasons for considering dialysis, laboratory investigations, and outcome in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic reports of percutaneous renal and surgical biopsies, as well as autopsy specimens, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 78 boys and 45 girls (M:F, 1.73:1); mean age was 6.28 +/- 4.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A portion of patients presented early (46.3%), while 53.7% presented late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oliguric (63.41%), anuric (20.33%), and nonoliguric (16.26%) ARF were the clinical types seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dialysis requirement was significantly higher in oliguric (P &lt; 0.005) and anuric (P &lt; 0.005) than nonoliguric ARF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary and secondary etiologies accounted for 29% and 71% of ARF cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (47.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> (27.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (16.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> (5.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004729'>acute tubulointerstitial nephritis</z:hpo> (2.8%) were primary etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024535" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Plasmodium falciparum malaria</z:e> (42.53%), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> (28.73%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> (11.49%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003587'>obstructive uropathy</z:mp> (8.05%) were major secondary etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Financial constraints on the part of parents of patients, as well as inadequate and/or lack of dialysis equipment, were major inhibitions to effective management of the patients; in fact, 6 patients took voluntary discharge due to inability to afford the cost of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality risk factors were late presentation [odds ratio (OR) 3.5, P &lt; 0.001], dialysis eligibility (OR 3.8, P &lt; 0.001), nondialysis (OR 23.1, P= 0.00004), primary etiology (OR 2.6, P &lt; 0.025), and presence of &gt; or =2 comorbidities (OR 2.9, P &lt; 0.025); overall mortality rate was 46.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that many of the causes of ARF in our patients are preventable; it should be possible to reduce morbidity due to ARF through purposive preventive measures </plain></SENT>
