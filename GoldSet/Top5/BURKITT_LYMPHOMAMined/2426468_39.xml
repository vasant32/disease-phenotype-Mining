<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 3.0-kilobase-pair Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA segment necessary for lymphocyte immortalization encodes at least part of a nuclear protein (EBNA2) which is characteristically expressed in latently infected, immortalized cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 1.5-kilobase open reading frame within this DNA segment has now been inserted into a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (MuLV)-derived expression vector (pZIP-NEO-SV(X)1) which provides for transcription of heterologous DNA but not for translational start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the recombinant DNA into NIH 3T3 cells resulted in expression of a full-sized EBNA2 which localized to the cell nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant new evidence is thereby provided that this 1.5 kilobase open reading frame includes a translational start site and encodes the entire EBNA2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the recombinant DNA into a helper cell line (psi am22b) providing amphotropic MuLV-packaging functions resulted in the release of a recombinant MuLV carrying the EBNA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This recombinant virus can infect rodent cells and convert them to stable EBNA2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rat-1 cells infected with the MuLV EBNA2 recombinant expressed EBNA2 and grew more rapidly in medium supplemented with 1 or 0.5% fetal calf serum than did Rat-1 cells infected with MuLV vector lacking EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Rat-1 cells expressing EBNA2 remained contact inhibited, anchorage dependent, and nontumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Different EBV isolates have one of at least two EBNA2 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite divergence between the two alleles, a human serum recognized the prototype EBNA2 allele (EBNA2A) as well as the variant EBNA2B allele characteristic of some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> EBV isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EBNA2B allele was also expressed from the MuLV-derived vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reproducible expression of EBNA2A or EBNA2B from these recombinant vectors will facilitate analysis of the EBNA2A and EBNA2B phenotypes </plain></SENT>
