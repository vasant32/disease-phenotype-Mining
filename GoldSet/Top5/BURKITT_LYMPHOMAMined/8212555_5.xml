<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The regulatory mechanisms which control latency and reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether DNA methylation is involved, we examined the BamHI-H divergent promoter, which also encompasses the origin for lytic replication (oriLyt) of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The divergent promoter was highly methylated in the stringently latent HH514cl16 cell line and largely unmethylated in the semipermissive FF41-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression vectors in which the divergent promoter directed transcription of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro methylation and transient transfections, we found an inverse correlation between the number of sites methylated and level of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of inhibition were observed when the methylated promoter was activated by BZLF1 or BRLF1 and in lymphoid or epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of two CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the BRLF1 binding sites of the divergent promoter was determined by site-directed mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that site-specific methylation of these CpGs was not solely responsible for inhibition of expression by methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation also reduced DNA replication mediated by oriLyt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that hypermethylation of the divergent promoter and oriLyt may suppress transcription and lytic replication of EBV </plain></SENT>
