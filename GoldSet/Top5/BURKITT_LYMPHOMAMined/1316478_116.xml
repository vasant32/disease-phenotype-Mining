<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six known promoters for latent gene expression and eight known gene products were identified in in vitro-immortalized lymphocytes and in the cell lines established spontaneously from seropositive adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in uncultured B cells from four seropositive adults was the same as that which occurred in spontaneously established EBV-positive B-cell lines from the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minimum of 17 polymerase chain reaction targets was required to circumscribe the known latent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the C promoter for the EBNA genes was detected in B-cell <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from three of the four subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcripts initiated from the alternative W promoter for EBNA expression were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spliced transcripts detected in the B cells contained only the C2-to-W1 alternative splice, which was nonproductive for EBNA4 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the other EBNA open reading frames were detected spliced onto the 3' ends of the C promoter-initiated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spliced <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the TP gene was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of the TP gene was restricted to TP1 promoter-initiated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, as no TP2 promoter-initiated transcripts were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from the LMP gene was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The F promoter which is active in the restricted expression latency that occurs in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was not detected being expressed in peripheral blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This pattern of latent gene expression is unique to uncultured B cells, indicating that there are profound differences between <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent states in vitro and in situ and suggesting a central role for the TP gene in the latency of EBV </plain></SENT>
