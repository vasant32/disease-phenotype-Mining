<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IFN arrests the growth of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> derived cell line Daudi cells in the G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G1-to-S progression is controlled by positive and negative regulatory genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effects of IFN on G1-controlling genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), MO15/Cdk7, and cyclins E and H was studied to assess positive regulators, while p15Ink4B, p16Ink4, p18, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 were assessed as negative regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cdks 2, 4, 6 and cyclin E were markedly down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MO15/Cdk7 expression showed little change, but its regulatory subunit (cyclin H) was down-regulated like cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of p15Ink4B and p16Ink4 was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>p18 was induced until 48 h and its expression returned to the initial level at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, p21Cip1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression remained at the baseline level throughout IFN treatment, while the expression of p27Kip1 increased at 48 and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that IFN changes the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> of G1-controlling genes towards the suppression of G1-to-S transition </plain></SENT>
