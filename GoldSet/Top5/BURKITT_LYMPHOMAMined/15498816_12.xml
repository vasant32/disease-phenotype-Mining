<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) is expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and effector memory alphabeta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gammadelta T cells represent an unconventional lymphocyte population that shares characteristics of NK cells and T cells and links innate and adaptive immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells comprise the majority of peripheral human gammadelta T cells and respond to the microbial metabolite (E)-4-hydroxy-3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-but-2-enyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (HMB-PP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that KLRG1 is expressed in a significant proportion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in cord blood and in the majority of peripheral Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells from adult donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KLRG1+ Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells displayed an effector memory phenotype, as KLRG1 was expressed mainly in Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells lacking CD27, CD45RA, CD62L, and CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike alphabeta T cells, where possession of KLRG1 identified effector memory cells with impaired proliferative capacity, KLRG1+ Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells were able to proliferate vigorously upon stimulation with HMB-PP in the presence of interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, KLRG1 ligation on Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells by antibodies did not inhibit HMB-PP-induced proliferation and cytokine production nor cytolysis of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
