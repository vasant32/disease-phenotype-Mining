<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The explanation for this prognostic significance is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied whether DNA ploidy was related to cellular resistance to 12 drugs, assessed with the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-thiazol-tetrazolium assay, in samples of 74 children with common (CD10+ precursor B-cell) ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had hyperdiploid ALL cells and 58 patients had nonhyperdiploid ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperdiploid ALL cells were more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> (median, 9.0-fold; P = .000003), to thioguanine (1.4-fold; P = .023), to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (1.8-fold; P = .016), and to I-asparaginase (19.5-fold; P = .022) than were nonhyperdiploid ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these two ploidy groups did not differ significantly in resistance to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36373">vindesine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi>, and teniposide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of S-phase cells was higher (P = .05) in the hyperdiploid ALL samples (median, 8.5%) than in the nonhyperdiploid ALL samples (median, 5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the percentage of cells in S-phase was not significantly related to in vitro drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the favorable prognosis associated with DNA hyperdiploidy in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> may be explained by a relative sensitivity of hyperdiploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolites</z:chebi>, especially to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and to I-asparaginase </plain></SENT>
