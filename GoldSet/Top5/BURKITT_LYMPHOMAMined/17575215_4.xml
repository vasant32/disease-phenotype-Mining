<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, are important regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological effects of BMPs on malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, however, remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation of the BMP-6 gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated BMP-6 promoter methylation and its gene expression in various histologic types of 90 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of BMP-6 promoter hypermethylation on clinical outcome was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BMP-6 was epigenetically inactivated in subsets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The silencing occurred with high frequency in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in association with aberrant BMP-6 promoter methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The methylation was observed in 60% (21 of 35) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cases and 100% (7 of 7) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> cell lines, and in 83% (5 of 6) of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and 86% (12 of 14) of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other histologic types of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied had little or no detectable methylation (1 of 49; 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of BMP-6 promoter hypermethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> statistically correlated with a decrease in disease-free survival (P = 0.014) and overall survival (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the methylation profile was an independent prognostic factor in predicting disease-free survival (P = 0.022) and overall survival (P = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BMP-6 promoter was hypermethylated more often in aggressive types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and the hypermethylation is likely to be related to the histologic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BMP-6 promoter methylation may be a potential new biomarker of risk prediction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
