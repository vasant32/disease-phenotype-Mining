<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta ligands interact with a complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases and they transmit their signals to the nucleus via a family of Smad proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of over 20 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines has been compiled including those that are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative, those that carry EBV with a restricted pattern of EBV latent gene expression (group I) and those that express the full range of latent EBV genes (group III), together with selected EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the EBV-negative and group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or a G(1) arrest in response to TGF-beta1 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, group III cell lines and LCLs were completely refractory to these effects of TGF-beta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the cell lines expressed the TGF-beta pathway Smads and the TGF-beta type I receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lack of responsiveness to TGF-beta1 appears to correlate with a down-regulation of TGF-beta type II receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies of EBV-converted and stably transfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines demonstrated that the EBV gene LMP-1 is neither necessary nor sufficient to block the TGF-beta1 response </plain></SENT>
