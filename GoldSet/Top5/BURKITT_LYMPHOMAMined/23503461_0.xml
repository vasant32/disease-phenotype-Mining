<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these activities ensure the virus is successful, they also make the virus oncogenic, particularly when infected people are immunosuppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show, strikingly, that one set of EBV's microRNAs (miRNAs) both sustain Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells in the absence of other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogenes and promote the transformation of primary B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
