<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the cells with neuraminidase increased the labeled sialoprotein by severalfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A nunber of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were effective in decreasing the amount of sialoprotein assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> was the most effective inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="16695">UMP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> were also inhibitory, but to a lesser degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> derivatives were similarly inhibitory, but generally less active than their monophosphate counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> were the least effective of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> tested; cCMP and cAMP showed a small degree of activity, whereas cUMP and cGMP were without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies indicated that a number of noncyclic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> can influence the activity of the sialyl transferase system </plain></SENT>
