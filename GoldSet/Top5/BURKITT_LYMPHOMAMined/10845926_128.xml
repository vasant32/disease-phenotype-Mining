<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chimeric anti-CD20 MAb rituximab has recently become a treatment of choice for low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FL) with a response rate of about 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have investigated the mechanism of action of rituximab on 4 FL and 1 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, 3 fresh FL samples and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab efficiently blocks the proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells, but not that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not detect significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the cell lines in response to rituximab alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines were targets of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, human complement-mediated lysis was highly variable between cell lines, ranging from 100% lysis to complete resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the role of the complement inhibitors CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59 showed that CD55, and to a lesser extent CD59, are important regulators of complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) in FL cell lines as well as in fresh cases of FL: Blocking CD55 and/or CD59 function with specific antibodies significantly increased CDC in FL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CDC and ADCC are major mechanisms of action of rituximab on B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> susceptibility of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to complement may be at least in part responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the response of different patients to rituximab in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we suggest that the relative levels of CD55 and CD59 may become useful markers to predict the clinical response </plain></SENT>
