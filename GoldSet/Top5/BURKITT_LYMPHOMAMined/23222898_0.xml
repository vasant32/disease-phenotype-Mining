<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (PTLD) present a major cause of mortality and morbidity after solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the factors associated with the development of early- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> PTLD in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the medical history, laboratory parameters, and pathology of 127 children with PTLD who were registered in the German multicenter pediatric PTLD registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected retrospectively from 1991 to 2003 and prospectively from 2004 onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared early (&lt;1 year) and late (&gt;1 year) PTLD using survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time to PTLD was 3.00 (95% confidence interval, 2.12-3.26) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients developed PTLD within the first year after transplantation (early PTLD) and 85 patients developed PTLD after 1 year (late PTLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early PTLD development was associated with younger age (P=0.0016), extranodal disease (P=0.019), graft organ involvement (P=0.0065), and immunosuppressive regimens including tacrolimus (P=0.001) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> (P=0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most early PTLD patients experienced graft rejection before PTLD diagnosis (P=0.0081) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early PTLD was often of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> histology (P=0.024) and tended to be Epstein-Barr virus positive (P=0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P=0.0047) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (P=0.016) were only observed in late PTLDs, which are more likely to present with nodal disease (P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and event-free survival were not significantly different between early and late PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early and late childhood PTLD have distinct characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whereas early PTLD appears mainly as an Epstein-Barr virus-driven disease especially favored by insufficient immunosurveillance, late PTLD often resembles <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with distinct pathogenetic alterations and nodal appearance </plain></SENT>
