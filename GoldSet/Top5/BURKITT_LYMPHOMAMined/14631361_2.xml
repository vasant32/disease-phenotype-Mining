<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTLDs of T-cell lineage are rare, mostly reported after renal transplantation and show less frequent association with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> after transplantation (NK-cell PTLDs) are very rare; only five cases are reported so far in the English literature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> developed after renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of EBV-associated, extranodal NK-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of nasal type, involving the breast in a cardiac allograft recipient 5 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells are positive for CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, CD7, CD43, CD56, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-1 and p53; and negative for surface CD3 and CD57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of T-cell receptor beta and gamma genes fails to show clonal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV studies show clonal episomal integration of EBV and latency II pattern (EBER-1+, LMP-1+, EBNA-1+, EBNA-2-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NK-cell PTLDs are rare complications that arise relatively late after solid organ transplantation, show strong association with EBV, and can follow an aggressive clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, we present the first reported case of NK-cell PTLD after cardiac transplantation and the unifying clinical and diagnostic features of NK-cell PTLDs occurring after solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
