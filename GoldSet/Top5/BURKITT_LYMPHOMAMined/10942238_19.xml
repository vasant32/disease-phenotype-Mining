<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherent quantitating problems are the main drawbacks of traditional PCR technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These limitations have been overcome by the recently developed real-time quantitative PCR (RQ PCR) technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, clinical application of the few published RQ PCR assays targeting immune gene rearrangements is hampered by the expensive and time-consuming need for individual hybridization probes for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new RQ PCR strategy targeting clonally rearranged IgH sequences that solves this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method uses only two different JH hybridization probes and four downstream JH primers homologous to consensus germline JH gene segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination with an allele-specific upstream (ASO) primer the consensus JH probes and primers allow quantitation of about 90% of possible IgH rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a series of 22 B-lineage ALL the new assay allowed the detection of one to 10 blasts in a background of 10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To prove the clinical utility we quantified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in 23 follow-up samples of six ALL patients with the new assay in comparison with a published RQ PCR technique that used individually designed primer/probe sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed that the sensitivity of the new RQ PCR assay was slightly higher for four of the six cases and about 100-fold higher for one case, enabling detection of an increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> level as an indicator of subsequent relapse 44 weeks earlier compared to the ASO probe assay in this particular patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest, that the novel RQ PCR assay is a rapid, technically simple, reliable, and sensitive alternative to traditional quantification assays and simplifies current approaches of monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
