<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latent EBV DNA in established cell lines, is mainly present as free covalently closed circles but <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA sequences with properties of integrated DNA also seem to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have extended the studies on the physical state of the EB <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA sequences in the cell line Raji which appear at a lower density than that for free EB <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA during fractionation on CsCl density gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such material a novel EcoRI EBV DNA fragment is present, which hybridizes to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences homologous to EcoRI A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This fragment is not present in free covalently closed circular EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When this EcoRI fragment is further analysed with HindIII a smaller fragment than expected, which contains BamHI W sequences, is detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of this HindIII fragment and its characteristics as a joint, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-host chromosome fragment will be discussed </plain></SENT>
