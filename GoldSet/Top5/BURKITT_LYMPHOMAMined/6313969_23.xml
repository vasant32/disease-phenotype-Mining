<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The two regions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome carrying partially homologous clusters of short tandem repeats (DSL and DSR [duplicated sequences, left and right, respectively] ) are transcribed into polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> upon spontaneous or chemical induction of the lytic virus cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Raji, an Epstein-Barr virus genome carrying a nonproducer cell line, transcription of DSL and DSR is only observed upon induction of an abortive life cycle of the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the nonproducer cell line Raji, the polyadenylated transcripts of DSL and DSR are about 2,500 and 2,700 bases, respectively, in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four different spontaneous Epstein-Barr virus producer lines, M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>, CC34-5, QIMR-WIL, and B95-8, differ in the length of their DSL and/or DSR regions by different numbers of tandem repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The size of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> corresponds in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to the size of the respective cluster of repeats, indicating that a large part of each <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species is colinearly transcribed from the entire tandem repeat arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the DSL and the DSR <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> have the same polarity proceeding from right to left on the Epstein-Barr virus genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence analysis of the DSR repeat revealed that translation of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> would be possible in three open reading frames within the repeat cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short homologies to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus IR-TR sequences and to immunoglobulin switch region sequences (IgH-S) are discussed </plain></SENT>
