<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work established CD30 as a member of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily whose ligand (CD30L) has also been cloned and expressed; CD30L is active as membrane-bound type II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, CD30L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was studied in a panel of 102 continuous human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and was found only in four Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one Burkit-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and one non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The product of CD30L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed as a membrane protein on the surface of these malignant B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these cell lines with soluble CD27L, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> or staphylococcus aureus Cowan antigen resulted in the enhancement of cell surface CD30L protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD30L <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unstimulated peripheral blood (PB) monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, or T-cells, but was detected in primary granulocytes; exposure to activating reagents induced and upregulated CD30L transcription in these different PB populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While CD40 and CD30L surface protein expression on PB monocytes could be enhanced or induced by treatment with gamma-interferon, these cells remained negative for CD30, both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, PB monocyte-derived macrophages and granulocytes remained negative for CD30 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, regardless of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only activated T-cells expressed CD30 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and surface protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD30L-transfected cells and cells constitutively expressing CD30L delivered a similar stimulus for proliferation of the CD30+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>)-derived cell line HDLM-2, but inhibited proliferation of the CD30+ large cell anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line KARPAS-299 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide strong evidence for the involvement in growth regulation of recombinant and natural CD30L through its interaction with the CD30 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that the CD30L-CD30 interaction has potent biological activity and might play a critical role in the immune response and pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and some NHL, in particular Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
