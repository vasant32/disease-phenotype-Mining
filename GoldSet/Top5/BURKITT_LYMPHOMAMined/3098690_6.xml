<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established 3 new EBV-negative cell lines, designated Sc-1, Ri-1 and Ci-1, from patients with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized them by cytogenetics and by study of surface membrane antigens with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) expression and Ig heavy- and light-chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 lines had a 14q+ abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ri-1 also had translocations involving chromosomes 2, 8 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ci-1 also had abnormalities involving chromosomes 2, 8 and 22 and its karyotype was 46, XX, t(2;8), t(14;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The t(2;8) had the same breakpoints as those reported in some cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied a classical Ph1-positive cell line previously established by Pegoraro et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(1983) and designated BV173 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of these 4 lines based on Ig expression and marker studies correlated well with their respective genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results are in keeping with the notion that leukaemic cell populations are clonal expansions of cells "frozen" at a particular stage in their differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, BV173 cells are at an early stage of B-cell differentiation, Ri-1 and Ci-1 cells are at intermediate stages and Sc-1 cells are at a relatively late stage in the B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
