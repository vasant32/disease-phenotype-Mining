<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As in in vivo, the mutations are largely nucleotide substitutions with the pattern of substitutions revealing a component of the human hypermutation program that is preferentially targeted to G/C residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The substitutions frequently create stop codons with IgM-loss variants also being generated by V domain-specific deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in transfectants expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, many IgM-loss variants additionally arise through short nontemplated nucleotide insertions into the V (but not C) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, antibody hypermutation is likely accompanied by DNA strand breaks scattered within the mutation domain </plain></SENT>
