<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IUDR treatment induced the formation of early antigen (EA), virus capsid antigen (VCA) and virus DNA replication in D98/Raji and D98/HR-1 cells whereas only EA was induced in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HR-1 clone No. 9 did not respond to IUDR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of transcription of virus genomes in these cell lines without IUDR treatment was uniform with 20--25% of virus DNA transcribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IUDR treatment enhanced the transcription of virus DNA to 50% in D98/Raji, D98/HR-1 and Raji cells but no enhancement of virus genome transcription was observed in HR-1 clone No. 9 The amount of virus <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the cells calculated from DNA-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridization kinetics was found to be proportional to the number of virus genomes per cell indicating that every copy of virus DNA in these cells is actively transcribed </plain></SENT>
