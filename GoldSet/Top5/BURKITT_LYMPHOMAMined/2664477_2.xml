<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that 125I-labeled Daudi cells had reduced amounts (approximately 1/20th) of immunoprecipitable binding (alpha) subunit [mol wt (Mr), 130,000] of the receptor and a relatively abundant 210,000 Mr form not seen in IM-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transmembranous (beta) subunit (Mr, 90,000) of the receptor, although not detected by 125I surface labeling, could be phosphorylated and, together with the 210,000 Mr form, exhibited the same 2-fold stimulation of phosphorylation by insulin as that in IM-9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Northern blot hybridization revealed a decrease in Daudi cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four major species of insulin receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Raji cell, another Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, also exhibited reduced protein and genetic expression of the insulin receptor, indicating that reduced insulin receptor expression may be representative of other Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
