<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that rituximab has a significant radiosensitizing effect on Raji cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether calcium signals participate in rituximab- and radiation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Raji cells, confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to detect kinetic changes in intracellular free calcium concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell survival, the rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Raji cells and the kinetics of γ-H2AX foci induction and loss were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>X-irradiation of Raji cells induced an initial increase of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium, followed by a decrease in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rituximab enhanced both the amplitude and the duration of intracellular calcium signals in the irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> significantly inhibited radiation- or radiation/rituximab combination treatment-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> and BAPTA/AM conferred no survival advantage on the irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although no significant difference was seen after 1h, the treatment of cells with a combination of irradiation and rituxiamb caused an increase of γ-H2AX foci when compared with irradiated cells after 8h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30740">EGTA</z:chebi> and BAPTA/AM suppressed the number of γ-H2AX foci induced by either radiation or radiation combined with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that rituximab increases the level of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i in irradiated Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The entry of calcium from the extracellular space plays an essential role in [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i-dependent radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> inhibited the formation of γ-H2AX foci, which are thought to prevent the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/Mg(2+)-dependent endonucleases and subsequent DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> most likely modulate only particular features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and fail to change the fates of cells that are already committed to die </plain></SENT>
