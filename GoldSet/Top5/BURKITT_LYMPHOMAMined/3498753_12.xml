<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With two new monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry, we defined three subpopulations among B cells expressing binding sites for peanut agglutinin (i.e., B cells of the germinal center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On monoclonal antibody (5B5) binds globotriaosyl <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The B lymphocytes binding 5B5 have binding sites for peanut agglutinin on the surface and express only small amounts of sIgD and sIgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When tested against a panel of B cell lines, only Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were 5B5+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the 5B5+ cells have larger average sizes and a large fraction of proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other monoclonal antibody (HK23) binds a 90,000 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes binding HK23 are 5B5- and include T cells and a subpopulation of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to 5B5+ cells, the HK23+ and peanut agglutinin positive B cells express a large amount of sIgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two subpopulations of germinal centers are distinct from the germinal center B cell subpopulation expressing the CD23 (Blast-2) antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CD23+ B cells are 5B5- and express an intermediate level of HK23 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, CD23+ B cells are highly variable in number, whereas the proportions of HK23+ and 5B5+ cells are relatively stable </plain></SENT>
