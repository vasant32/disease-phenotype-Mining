<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Respective patterns were characterized for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (HU)-promoted loss of EBV genomes from EBV-infected epithelioid cell lines derived from the noncancerous portion of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epithelioid cell lines GT38 and PN were less sensitivity to HU than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines Akata, Raji, and Daudi in terms of cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On passage in medium with 50 microM HU, the fraction of EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive cells was reduced substantially in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, but only slightly in the epithelioid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was reduced in Akata, Raji, and Daudi cells upon passage in 50 microM HU by 95%, 70%, and 50%, respectively, but by only 10% in GT38 cells, in which EBV DNA reduction was enhanced at increased concentrations of HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that EBV genome is more easily lost from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines than from epithelioid cell lines upon culturing in HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that the elimination of EBV could be therapeutically effective in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> by HU </plain></SENT>
