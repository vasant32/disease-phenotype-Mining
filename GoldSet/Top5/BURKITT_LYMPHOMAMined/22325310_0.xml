<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In Africa, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are widely represented by pediatric Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Abidjan, cytology performed after needle biopsy may be an examination of choice for pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> because of its low cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the value of this cytological examination in comparison with MYC rearrangement assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cytological examination was performed after needle biopsy of masses suspected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reliability of this cytological examination was assessed versus a cytogenetic technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe targeting locus 8q24 (MYC) which is recurrently rearranged in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 8 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main locations of the suspicious masses were maxillofacial and abdominal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty cytological examinations identified cytological aspects of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among these cases, the cytogenetic technique identified 24 cytogenetic rearrangements compatible with a translocation involving MYC as described in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six cytological examinations identified cytological aspects of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without MYC translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two cytological examinations were not compatible with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MYC status was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two cytological examinations were technically not contributive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cytological examination showed good performance, notably with excellent sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cytological examinations compatible with a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> without MYC translocation (6/30=20.0%) could be explained by the absence of translocation involving locus 8q24 (MYC) in some endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
