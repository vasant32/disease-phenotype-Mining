<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article describes the case of a 9-year-old child who presented with a huge <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involving the right shoulder with osteolytic and sclerotic lesions in the scapula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathological findings were suggestive of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the immunohistochemical findings discard a lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the child also presented a cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, the fact that Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is generally extranodal, the marked swelling of the shoulder, and the extensive involvement of the bone strongly argue that this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had its origin in the scapula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates the importance of including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving bones in children </plain></SENT>
