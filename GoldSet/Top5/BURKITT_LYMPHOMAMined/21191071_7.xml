<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human gammaherpesvirus EBV, causative agent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> and several <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, encodes proteins that subvert immune responses, notably those mediated by T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less is known about EBV interference with innate immunity, more specifically at the level of TLR-mediated pathogen recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> dsDNA sensor TLR9 is expressed on B cells, a natural target of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that EBV particles trigger innate immune signaling pathways through TLR9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using an in vitro system for productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, it has now been possible to compare the expression of TLRs by EBV(-) and EBV(+) human B cells during the latent and lytic phases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several TLRs were found to be differentially expressed either in latently EBV-infected cells or after induction of the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, TLR9 expression was profoundly decreased at both the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein levels during productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified the EBV lytic-phase protein BGLF5 as a protein that contributes to downregulating TLR9 levels through <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reducing the levels of a pattern-recognition receptor capable of sensing the presence of EBV provides a mechanism by which the virus could obstruct host innate antiviral responses </plain></SENT>
