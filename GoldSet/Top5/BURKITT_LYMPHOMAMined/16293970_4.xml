<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasostatin transfected cells were subcutaneously inoculated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, CA46, colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line, SW480, as well as endothelial cells PAE and SVEC4 were used for evaluating the function of vasostatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that vasostatin transfer caused enhanced malignant behavior of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumor</z:mpath> cell line, BON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, spreading and cellular invasion were also enhanced in vasostatin-expressing BON cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> suppressor genes including p53, nm23, Rb and vinculin were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cell cycle regulatory protein, p27kip1, and cell differentiation-related protein kinase, PKR, were also significantly down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression of NKG2D ligands, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and MICB, were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mice implanted with vasostatin-expressing BON cells showed an earlier and faster <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-proliferative effects of vasostatin could not be proven in other cells except in PAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that vasostatin does probably not have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> inhibitory effect by itself, but rather modulates processes which are necessary for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, one should be very careful when using vasostatin as an anti-tumoral agent in clinical trials, at least for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_366'>neuroendocrine tumors</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
