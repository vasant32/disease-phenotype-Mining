<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each autopsy was classified according to the systems of Rappaport and Lukes-Collins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with the initial diagnosis were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial histologic diagnoses of the autopsied population were similar in distribution to other published series of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 cases which initially demonstrated nodular patterns of growth, the following distribution was found at autopsy: 25%, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 6%, nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 32%, diffuse histiocytic (large cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DHL); 21%, diffuse undifferentiated (non-Burkitt's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DUL); and 16%, the remaining diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 136 patients with initial diagnosis of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the following distributions were observed at autopsy: 20%, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 0%, nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 31%, diffuse histiocytic (large cell) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 12%, diffuse undifferentiated (non-Burkitt's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 9%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e>; 14%, diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; and 14%, the remaining diffuse morphologic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-four cases which were initially diagnosed as follicular center cell type within the Lukes-Collins classification gave the following distribution at autopsy: 21%, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; 25%, small noncleaved type; 17%, large noncleaved type; 23%, non-follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (17% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> B); and the remaining 13% were distributed among the other follicular center cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This autopsy review demonstrates the rarity of nodular (follicular) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> at autopsy, and the predominance of the diffuse histiocytic or "transformed" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides a comparison of the rate of histologic progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the same patient population at autopsy with a previously published study of progression during life </plain></SENT>
