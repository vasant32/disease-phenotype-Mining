<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signals were stored in list mode by which a five-dimensional space was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells--differentiated into: 1) erythrocytes, 2) reticulocytes, 3) nucleated erythroid cells, 4) platelets, 5) lymphocytes, 6) monocytes, 7) neutrophils, 8) eosinophils, and 9) immature leukocytes--had to meet unique criteria with regard to their characteristics in the created five-dimensional space in order to be classified in a specific cell category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forward and orthogonal light-scattering signals were matched with three fluorescence variables to obtain discrimination without necessitating erythrocyte lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52293">Thiazole orange</z:chebi> (binding predominantly to <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) and LDS-751 (principally detecting DNA) were used to differentiate erythrocytes, platelets, reticulocytes, and nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody, CD45, conjugated with phycoerythrin, was used to aid in discriminating between lineages of nucleated cells </plain></SENT>
