<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It regulates a variety of cellular activities, including proliferation, development, migration and differentiation known to be modulated by a series of complex signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies have addressed the mechanistic action of Nm23-H1 in the context of these cellular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the downstream pathways modulated by Nm23-H1, we expressed Nm23-H1 in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> derived B-cell line BJAB and performed pathway specific microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genes with significant changes in expression patterns were clustered in groups which are responsible for regulating cell cycle, p53 activities and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a general reduction of cell cycle regulatory proteins including cyclins and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (anti proliferation), and upregulation of apoptotic genes which included caspase 3, 9 and Bcl-x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nm23-H1 was also found to upregulate p53 and downregulate p21 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of these genes were validated by real time PCR and results from promoter assays indicated that Nm23-H1 expression downregulated cyclin D1 in a dose responsive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, we show that Nm23-H1 forms a complex with the cellular transcription factor AP1 to modulate cyclin D1 expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BJAB cells expressing Nm23-H1 showed reduced proliferation rate and were susceptible to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> which may in part be due to a direct interaction between Nm23-H1 and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Nm23-H1 may have a role in the regulation of cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human B-cells </plain></SENT>
