<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To address the problem of historically poor results in the treatment of children with advanced-stage Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B cell (SIg+) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), an intensive chemotherapy regimen was devised using the most effective single agents in high-dose short courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment commenced with a fractionated schedule of intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (300 mg/m2 every 12 hours for six doses) followed immediately by Adriamycin (50 mg/m2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (1.5 mg/m2) with combined intrathecal (IT) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predictably, this treatment produced virtually complete disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately on hematologic recovery, IV high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (1,000 mg/m2 over 24 hours) followed by IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (400 mg/m2 over the next 48 hours) was administered with leucovorin rescue and repeated IT treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment sequence described above is repeated four times, with the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> doubled in succeeding courses, up to 3,200 mg/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire planned therapy required approximately 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since 1981, we treated a total of 29 children with this approach, 19 of whom had massive unresectable intraabdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to initial extent of disease, 17 were classified as stage III, four as stage IV non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), and eight as B cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 12 patients with stage IV NHL or B cell ALL had initial involvement of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of 29 patients (93%) attained a complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 17 stage III NHL patients remain disease free, for periods ranging from 3+ months to 4 1/2+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actuarial estimate of the proportion of stage III patients remaining disease free at 2 years is 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results in patients with initial involvement of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and/or marrow are much less favorable, with only two of ten patients who attained remission apparently being cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition to stage, the initial serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level emerged as a prognostic indicator, higher levels (over 1,000 IU/L) being associated with the worst prognosis (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Major toxicity consisted of severe hematopoietic suppression and febrile episodes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this treatment is highly effective for advanced-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumors</z:e> in children free of initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
