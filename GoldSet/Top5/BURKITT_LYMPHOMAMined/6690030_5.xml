<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This monoclonal IgM was coupled to either ricin A chain or gelonin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two different immunotoxins obtained retained the apparent immunological specificity of 38-13 IgM, as shown by flow cytofluorometry analysis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Ramos cells and the apparently irrelevant Epstein-Barr virus-containing lymphoblastoid Priess cells were used as targets in in vitro assays of the cytotoxic properties of the two immunotoxins by measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated ricin A chain, gelonin, and 38-13 IgM exhibited very low intrinsic cytotoxicity on both target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>38-13 ricin A chain and 38-13 gelonin conjugates exerted toxic effects on both target cells which were about 6000-fold and 3000-fold higher than uncoupled ricin A chain and gelonin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of these conjugates almost reached that of intact ricin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Ramos <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, the kinetics of action of the 38-13 ricin A chain conjugate was almost as fast as that of intact ricin, because 50% protein synthesis inhibition was reached after 3 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the kinetics of action in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Priess was much slower (50% protein synthesis inhibition after 10 hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An obviously irrelevant immunotoxin (anti-trinitrophenol IgM-ricin A chain) had no significant cytotoxic effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Ramos and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Priess cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An excess of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4139">D-galactose</z:chebi> was shown previously to inhibit the 38-13 IgM from binding to the reactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen bearing a terminal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An excess of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4139">D-galactose</z:chebi> (0.1 M) inhibited the cytotoxic effect of the two 38-13 immunotoxins, whereas it did not prevent the cytotoxic effect of the anti-trinitrophenol immunotoxin on the same trinitrophenol labeled target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the cytotoxic effect observed with 38-13 immunotoxins on non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> Priess cells was mediated through their binding to a very low number of antigenic sites undetectable by conventional immunological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The main characteristics of 38-13 immunotoxins appear to be their fast kinetics of action and the very low number of antigenic sites required for the expression of their toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These properties could be related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> nature of the reacting antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Such <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigens would represent valuable targets for therapeutic use of immunotoxins </plain></SENT>
