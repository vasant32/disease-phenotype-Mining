<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Formation of this adduct in isolated DNA and in cells was studied with a modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-postlabeling procedure including HPLC separation, nuclease P1 enrichment, two-dimensional TLC of adducted nucleotide bisphosphates on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53231">PEI</z:chebi>-cellulose, and quantification of adduct spots by liquid scintillation counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adduct formation with the more reactive crotonaldehyde was included for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synthesized adducted dG-3'-phosphates served as external standards for identification and quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In calf thymus DNA, hexenal (0.2 mM) shows a time dependent formation of adducts, yielding 1.55 pmol/mumol of DNA at 5 h incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With crotonaldehyde (0.2 mM) the adduct rate was about 10-fold higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hexenal also generated 1,N2-propano-dG adducts in the human lymphoblastoid Namalva cell line (0.2 mM, 1 h, 86 fmol/mumol of DNA) and in primary rat colon mucosa cells (0.4 mM, 30 min, 50 fmol/mumol of DNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In primary colon mucosa cells from rats and humans, hexenal and crotonaldehyde (0.4 mM, 30 min) induced DNA damage, detected by single cell microgel electrophoresis (comet assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary rat gastric mucosa cells, hexenal was only weakly active, inducing detectable DNA damage in 20% of cells at 0.8 mM concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, primary mucosa cells from rat esophagus were as sensitive as colon cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After single oral application of hexenal to rats (up to 320 mg/kg body wt) DNA damage was not detectable in gastrointestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hexenal in selected flavored foods revealed concentrations up to 14 ppm (0.14 mM) that are comparable to its natural occurrence in some fruits and vegetables (up to 30 ppm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the concentration range selected for the toxicological studies described here clearly is relevant: Hexenal, at concentrations found in food, exerts genotoxic effects in cells from rat and human gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
