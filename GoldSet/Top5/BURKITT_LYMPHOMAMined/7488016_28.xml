<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of G-protein coupled chemokine receptors and turned out to be identical to the recently described receptor EBI1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed that BLR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be highly stimulated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>- and anti-CD3-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BLR2-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> could be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Epstein-Barr virus positive B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that transcription of the BLR2 gene could be specifically induced in Epstein-Barr virus negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 41 cells via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-mediated activation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2, a key regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular genes in immortalized B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest an involvement of BLR2 in the regulation of migration in activated lymphocytes and in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
