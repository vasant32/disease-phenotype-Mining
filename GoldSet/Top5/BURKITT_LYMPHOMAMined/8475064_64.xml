<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The B-cell surface molecule CD22, when cross-linked, modulates signaling through the surface IgM (sIgM)-B-cell receptor (BCR) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the basis of this interaction between CD22 and the human sIgM complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After lysis of B cells or B-cell lines in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi>, CD22 coimmunoprecipitated a kinase activity that in vitro-phosphorylated two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of 150 and 130 kDa on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti-serum specific for a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of CD22, we found these proteins to be CD22 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the phosphorylated 150-kDa CD22 was found in the sIgM-BCR complex maintained by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27729">digitonin</z:chebi>, along with Ig alpha/mb-1, Ig beta/B29, and a 75-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> precipitated by an antiserum specific to protein-tyrosine kinase PTK72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD22 is likely to be an important signaling partner in the sIgM-BCR complex since it is very rapidly and strikingly phosphorylated after sIgM is cross-linked and since it contains the antigen recognition homology I (ARHI) motif, present in other antigen receptor molecules </plain></SENT>
