<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess possible alterations of c-myc transcriptional control in murine B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we have investigated the pattern of DNaseI hypersensitive sites in the gene's putative regulatory region and within the gene in a variety of genomic contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of such sites were found in several cell types, but none of these was detectable in a gene which was shown to be transcriptionally silent by the criterion of elongation of nascent transcripts in isolated nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results differ from those of a previous study, in which a DNaseI-hypersensitive site approximately 2 kb upstream of the gene was proposed to be associated with negative regulation of c-myc transcription in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis of DNA sequences presented here reveals that this region is highly homologous between mouse and human, suggesting that these upstream hypersensitive sites do not reflect species-specific regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also present data indicating that this hypersensitive site distinguishes the c-myc alleles in translocation-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>plasma cell tumors</z:mp> which lack c-myc rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we report the existence of hypersensitive sites within the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these appears to be associated with cryptic promoters that are employed only when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> promoters are lost as a consequence of chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in the context of c-myc translocation and gene breakage and with respect to possible stage-specific regulation of the gene's transcriptional competence </plain></SENT>
