<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cysteine, typically present in its oxidized form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi> in the extracellular space, is regarded as the rate-limiting substrate for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">Cystine</z:chebi> is transported into cells by the highly specific amino-acid antiporter system xc- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells display limited uptake capacity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>, and are thus prone to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we stably expressed the substrate-specific subunit of system xc-, xCT, in HH514 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>xCT-overexpressing cells became highly resistant to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, particularly upon GSH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous predictions, the increase of intracellular cysteine did not affect the cellular GSH pool, but concomitantly boosted extracellular cysteine concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though cells were depleted of bulk GSH, xCT overexpression maintained cellular integrity by protecting against <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, a very early event in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that system xc- protects against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> not by elevating intracellular GSH levels, but rather creates a reducing extracellular environment by driving a highly efficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>/cysteine redox cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi>/cysteine redox cycle by itself must be viewed as a discrete major regulator of cell survival </plain></SENT>
