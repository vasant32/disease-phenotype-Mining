<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of CAT-8015, a second-generation recombinant immunotoxin composed of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked affinity matured V(H) and V(L) chains of the mouse anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody RFB4 fused to PE38, to the parental compound CAT-3888 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biological activity of CAT-8015 was examined in vitro using B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines and in vivo in a JD38-based s.c. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model in NCr athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics and interspecies scaling of CAT-8015 were evaluated in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential toxicity of CAT-8015 was assessed in monkeys in a toxicologic study and compared with CAT-3888 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IC50 values of CAT-8015 in vitro using the EHEB, MEC1, Daudi, CA46, and JD38 cell lines ranged from 0.3 to 8.6 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic studies with CAT-8015 were conducted in mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The t1/2 was calculated to be 0.42, 0.61, and 0.79 hours and the Vss was 1.37, 5.57, and 140.3 mL in mouse, rat, and monkey, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, when JD38 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing animals were treated with CAT-8015 at doses &gt; or =75 microg/kg at 48-hour intervals for a total of three doses, a rapid reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume and in some cases complete remission in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comparative toxicologic study showed comparable clinical and anatomic pathology changes for CAT-8015 and CAT-3888 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAT-8015 is a CD22-targeting immunotoxin that, in preclinical studies, has greatly improved efficacy compared with CAT-3888 </plain></SENT>
