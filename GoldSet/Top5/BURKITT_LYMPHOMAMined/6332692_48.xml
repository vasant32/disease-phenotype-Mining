<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two distinct antigen systems (L26 and L27) specifically expressed in human B lymphocytes were identified using TB2-2B3 (2B3) and T3-5B3 (5B3) monoclonal antibodies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas L26 antigen defined by 2B3 were rarely expressed on the surface of B cells but abundant in the cytoplasm, 127 antigens detected by 5B3 was clearly expressed on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two antigens appeared to be restricted in their expression to B cells, as they were found in most B cells but not other cell types including thymocytes, T cells, monocytes and granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional studies demonstrated that L27 was more easily lost from B cells after activation with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> than was L26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, plasma cell <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma cells, was devoid of both L26 and L27, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> of B cell type expressed L26 but not L27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two antigens co-existed in the same B cell lines including Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell lines, B cell type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>) cell line, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines, but pre-B and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> cell lines were entirely negative for both L26 and L27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation studies showed that L26 consisted of at least two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> with molecular weights of 30K and 33K daltons, which were clearly distinct from HLA-DR antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antigen L27 is presently under study </plain></SENT>
