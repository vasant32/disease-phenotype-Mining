<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In lymphoblastoid cell lines, six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, -LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP1, 2A, 2B), and two nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) are expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This form of latency, termed latency III, is also encountered in some posttransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In EBV-positive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, the EBERs, EBNA1, and the LMPs are expressed (latency II), whereas in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) only the EBERs and EBNA1 have been detected (latency I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of EBV proteins in 17 cases of EBV-positive endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> by immunohistology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of LMP1 was seen in variable proportions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in two cases and EBNA2 was detected in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in three other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the BZLF1 trans-activator protein was expressed in a few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in 6 cases, indicating entry into the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A phenotypic drift from latency I to latency III has been observed previously in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in vivo and indicate that the operational definition of EBV latencies is not easily applied to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
