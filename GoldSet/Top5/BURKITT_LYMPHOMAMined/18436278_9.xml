<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in Uganda are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of B-cell derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The field of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> immunophenotype has rapidly progressed because of the increasing availability of markers applicable to routine sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the latter have allowed the identification of distinctive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities in the developed countries, such approach has not yet been used in Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-nine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from the Department of Pathology of Makerere University were used for tissue micro-array (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) construction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four-micrometer-thick sections were cut from <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and Giemsa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were also used for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunohistochemistry, lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were classified as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) (95 cases), diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (19 cases), mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (4 cases), and B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, a homogeneous phenotype (CD10(+), Bcl-6(+), Bcl-2(-), MUM1/IRF4-, and Ki-67 approximately 100%) and a stable Epstein-Barr virus integration were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A distinctive and unusual feature was the frequent plasma cellular differentiation, along with the positivity for CD30 and CD138 (recorded in 35 and 43 cases, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to our findings, most non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in Uganda are endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> followed by diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rest consist of rare but clinically important entities such as mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The availability of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi> and immunohistochemistry has enabled us to precisely categorize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that have so far been diagnosed in Uganda as "high-grade/aggressive" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> on the basis of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
