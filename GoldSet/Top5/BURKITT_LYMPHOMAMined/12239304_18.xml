<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this system, detailed kinetic studies of promoter activity are possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously reported promoter elements upstream of -221 from the transcription start and the ZIIR sequence had little effect on the Zp promoter, but the ZI and ZIIIA elements were essential for early activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ZIIIB element mediates autoactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the ZV repressor sequence greatly increased the induction of the promoter but did not make it constitutively active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Zp transcription in response to BCR cross-linking declined after a few hours; this decline was reduced and delayed by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi>, indicating that <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication or a late <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene can play a role in the switch off of the Zp promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late expression of the LMP1 protein may account for this </plain></SENT>
