<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human Class I HLA antigens (HLA-A,B,C) were isolated by immune precipitation from cells labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>, [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine or 125I (by lactoperoxidase-catalysed cell-surface iodination) and were analysed using both one- and two-dimensional electrophoretic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and in human peripheral blood lymphocytes the electrophoretic mobility of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled HLA-A,B,C heavy chains consistently differed from that of molecules labelled by other means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled heavy chains appeared to be larger and to possess a more acidic pI than did heavy chains labelled with [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine or 125I, or identified by Coomassie Blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates, under conditions where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled antigens were shown to be dephosphorylated, did not affect the mobilities of the [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>]methionine-labelled heavy chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On glycosidase treatment, the positions of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-labelled heavy chains were affected by neuraminidase but not by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results imply that phosphorylated HLA-A,B,C antigens comprise only a small proportion (relative to the total cellular HLA-A,B,C antigens) of the biosynthetically mature molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possible significance of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
