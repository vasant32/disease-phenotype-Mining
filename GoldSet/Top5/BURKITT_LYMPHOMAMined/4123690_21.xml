<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study establishes that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-related <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumors</z:e> is a 70S component encapsulated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-instructed DNA polymerase in a particle possessing a density characteristic of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, the DNA synthesized by the Burkitt particles hybridizes specifically to the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of Rauscher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, four features characteristic of a known oncogenic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> agent are also exhibited by particles found with a high (87%) frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> particle and the Epstein-Barr virus and their etiological roles remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, relevant to these issues is the finding reported here that the presence of Epstein-Barr virus information in nonneoplastic cells does not lead to the production of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> particles that have been detected now in three different human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's disease </plain></SENT>
