<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition (= anticellular) activity of differently pretreated HIF preparations was determined by the reduction of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-TDR) uptake in a microassay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated that the degree of anticellular activity is directly proportional to the antiviral activity of different HIF preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These preparations were obtained from peripheral leukocytes (lHIF) or diploid fibroblasts (fHIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together with gel chromatography results, and the sensitivity of the anticellular activity to tryptic digestion and heat inactivation, these results suggest that the anticellularly active substance is a protein which is very similar to, or identical with, interferon </plain></SENT>
