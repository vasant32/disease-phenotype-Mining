<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A quantitative semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detecting the clone-specific rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was developed to improve sensitivity and specificity of amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, one leukemic cell could be detected in a background of 10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients investigated were in complete remission at the end of induction therapy as evaluated by morphologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (73%) had no detectable residual leukemic cells using the sensitive semi-nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (27%) were PCR positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three had a low level (&lt;2 x 10(-5) leukemic cells per bone marrow cell), while four patients had a high level (&gt;2 x 10(5)) of detectable residual leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with low or undetectable levels of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> remained in complete remission at a median of 63 months from diagnosis (range 40-80 months), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with a high level of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> subsequently relapsed at a median of 21 months from diagnosis (range 13-37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient groups with undetectable or low, and high level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> did not differ significantly in other clinical or genetic features with prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> at the end of the intensive induction therapy period is predictive of outcome in childhood B lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If confirmed by large prospective studies, the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> might be useful in stratifying patients into high and low risk categories </plain></SENT>
