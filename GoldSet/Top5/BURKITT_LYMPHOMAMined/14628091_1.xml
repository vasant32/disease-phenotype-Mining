<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to report on the dose homogeneity in total body irradiated patients undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), and carcinogenic risk in surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1987 and 2001, 105 patients received hyperfractionated (6 fractions in 3 days) 12 Gy Total Body Irradiation (TBI) in our institution with lateral opposed fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had measurements with thermoluminiscence dosimetry (TLD100) placed on seven bilateral body sites in vivo, controlled by the randophantom measurements to verify reasonable dose homogeneity achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comorbid effects in the whole TBI conditioning group with at least three months post BMT follow-up were noted and surviving patients who had a minimum 5-year and maximum 14-year follow-up (median 7.8 years) have been evaluated for carcinogenic radiation risk on the basis of tissue weighting factors as defined by ICRP 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reasonable dose homogeneity by lateral opposed beam TBI has been obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 105 patients in whom lateral TLD100 measurement means were within +5% of the planned doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calculated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> risk factor was 11.34% for males and 12.40% for females, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second-cancer</z:e> has been detected whilst radiation-induced 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> and 10 interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> comorbidities were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose homogenization can be well achieved for hyperfractionated lateral-beam TBI with acceptable comorbidities and estimated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second-cancer</z:e> risk is significant but relatively low compared to the risk from the clinical indications for TBI </plain></SENT>
