<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent characterization of the 5'-flanking region of IL-10 led to the identification of the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of B cells with EBV induces IL-10 production which may contribute to EBV-induced transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present report, IL-10 promoter elements involved in the constitutive expression of IL-10 in EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AT-rich region between -54/-66 from the transcriptional start site was found to be important for IL-10-promoter activity in BL36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A point mutation at position -60 (T/A) was associated with over 90% reduction of luciferase activity in the cell lines BL36 and BL74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conversion of A/T at position -57 led to enhanced promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition the AT-rich region could serve as an enhancer for the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> basic promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In BJAB cells (EBV-negative), sequences between -205/-139 rather than the AT-rich region were involved in IL-10 promoter regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This underlines the importance of the AT-rich region for EBV-associated IL-10 promoter regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results further the understanding of how the IL-10 gene could be regulated in B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
