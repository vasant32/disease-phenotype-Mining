<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case of primary gastric Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is described in a child presenting as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo>, including the direct monitoring of the disease response by sequential endoscopic biopsy and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 9-year-old boy who presented with gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> caused by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial imaging investigations were non-diagnostic but gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed massive involvement of the gastric mucosa with a primary Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His subsequent clinical progress and disease response were monitored directly by endoscopy and he remains in clinical remission 4 years after initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report of primary Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> presenting as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical course and progress of the patient were monitored by sequential endoscopic biopsy, histology and molecular analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
