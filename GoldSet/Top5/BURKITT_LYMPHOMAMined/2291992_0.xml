<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method was developed to avoid non-specific killing by complement or toxin or batch-to-batch variability and provides a 3 log reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in a model of B lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low density bone marrow mononuclear cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 degrees C with anti CD10 (ALB2 Immunotech) and/or anti CD19 (Bg4) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and then mixed with low density <z:chebi fb="80" ids="53550">polypropylene</z:chebi> beads precoated with a rat antimouse MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 h at 4 degrees C the beads with target cells were decanted; the depleted marrow was collected through a microfilter and cryoperserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After immunodepletion the recovery of nucleated cells was 75% with a median of 0.75 x 10(8) cells/kg (range 0.3-3.6) and the recovery of hematopoietic progenitors was 83% with a median of 2.9 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> 16 mg/kg and melphalan 140 mg/m2 for three patients, fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) following melphalan 140 mg/m2 for nine patients, TBI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 120 mg/m2 for two patients and TBI associated with melphalan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
