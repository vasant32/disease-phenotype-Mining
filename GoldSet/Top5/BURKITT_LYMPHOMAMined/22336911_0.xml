<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the antitumor effects of plitidepsin alone and in combination with rituximab and investigated the effects of each drug and the combination on the cell cycle and mechanism of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several Diffuse Large Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) lines and Burkitt cell lines were tested for sensitivity to plitidepsin and rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DLCL and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines were inhibited by plitidepsin in nanomolar concentrations, while rituximab sensitivity varied among different cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ramos and the RL cell lines proved sensitive to rituximab and were used to test the effects of each of the two drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two agents exhibited synergism at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For in vivo studies, irradiated athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice were engrafted with the Ramos <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were ~0.5 cm in diameter, and toxic and therapeutic effects were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the in vivo study, additive effects of the combined two drugs, was demonstrated without an increase in host toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The in vitro synergy and the in vivo additive antitumor effects without an increase in host toxicity with two relatively non-marrow suppressive agents encourages further development of this combination for treatment of aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
