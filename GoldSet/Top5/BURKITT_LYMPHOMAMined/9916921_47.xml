<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD10 is expressed in a high percentage of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the antigen is not lineage specific, CD10 expression is widely used to define subgroups within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and is a useful tool for detecting the presence of leukemic blasts in the bloodstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently available monoclonal antibodies to CD10 have been found to be effective only in fresh-frozen tissue and for techniques such as flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have used a recombinant protein corresponding to the whole of CD10 to generate a monoclonal antibody that is effective in paraffin-embedded tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used this antibody to assay for the presence of CD10 on a range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong staining was seen in lymphoid germinal centers, renal tubules, glomeruli, syncytiotrophoblast, hepatic parenchymal canaliculi, B-lineage ALL, follicle center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a proportion of cases of large-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that this antibody will be of value in the characterization of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, in particular the differential diagnosis of small-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and subtyping of lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, as well as the investigation of the significance of expression of CD10 in other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological tissues </plain></SENT>
