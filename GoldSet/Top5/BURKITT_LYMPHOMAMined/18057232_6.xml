<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The function of LMP2B is largely unknown, whereas LMP2A blocks B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling transduction and induction of lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, thereby promoting B-cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfection experiments on LMP2B in EBV-negative B cells and the silencing of LMP2B in EBV-harboring Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Akata cells suggest that LMP2B interferes with the function of LMP2A, but the role of LMP2B in the presence of functional EBV has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, LMP2B, LMP2A, or both were overexpressed in EBV-harboring Akata cells to study the function of LMP2B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of LMP2B increased the magnitude of EBV switching from its latent to its lytic form upon BCR cross-linking, as indicated by a more-enhanced upregulation and expression of EBV lytic genes and significantly increased production of transforming EBV compared to Akata vector control cells or LMP2A-overexpressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LMP2B lowered the degree of BCR cross-linking required to induce lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, LMP2B colocalized with LMP2A as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence and restored calcium mobilization upon BCR cross-linking, a signaling process inhibited by LMP2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggest that LMP2B negatively regulates the function of LMP2A in preventing the switch from latent to lytic EBV replication </plain></SENT>
