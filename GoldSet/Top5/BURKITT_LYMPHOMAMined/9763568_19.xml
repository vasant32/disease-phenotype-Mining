<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Group I Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines (L3055, Elijah, Louckes, BL2, and BL29) retaining the original biopsy phenotype were found to undergo prolonged phenotypic, functional, and molecular change on short-term exposure to soluble recombinant CD40L trimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to, extent of, and duration of change appeared to reflect passage number in that the earliest passaged lines, L3055 and BL29, were generally the most susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Culture of group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines with CD40L resulted in significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> (without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>) that, for L3055 cells, was sustained for 7 to 9 days after 72 hours of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by the formation of large homotypic aggregates together with gross changes in individual cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and a concomitant upregulation of CD54 (ICAM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the five group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines exhibited rapid downregulation of the hallmark CD77 surface antigen, which, for L3055 cells, was maintained for at least 12 days after 72 hours of incubation with CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of BL2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were induced to express CD40 homodimers on CD40-stimulation, whereas only monomers were detected in unstimulated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments using CD40-transfected Rat-1 fibroblasts showed that the ability to signal for dimer formation required Thr234 of CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For L3055 and BL29 cells, an initial 72 hours of exposure to CD40L resulted in the maintenance of homodimers for up to 14 and 10 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a close correlation between the induction and duration of CD40 homodimers and the appearance of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For L3055 cells, which are sensitive to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-induction on BCR-engagement, exposure to CD40L for 72 hours was found to provide considerable protection from anti-IgM, which was still significant to 20 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The implications of such sustained effects on relatively short-term exposure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> B cells to CD40L are discussed </plain></SENT>
