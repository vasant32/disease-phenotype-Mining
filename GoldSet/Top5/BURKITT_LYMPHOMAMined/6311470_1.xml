<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report we analysed the cellular membrane changes that were related to the development of sensitivity to NK activity in Raji cells with metabolic inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NK sensitivity does not develop in P3HR-1 superinfected Raji cells that are cultured in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> and drops to half the amount usually detected in superinfected cells that are grown with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48001">protein synthesis inhibitor</z:chebi> cyclohexamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiments with cyclohexamide blocks removed after 24 h, the target cell sensitivity to NK returns to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control Raji cells cultured with the same inhibitors for up to 72 h do not develop any sensitivity to NK cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the development of sensitivity to NK destruction in Raji cells following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> is due to the addition to the cell membrane of a virally promoted molecule(s) that requires active <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
