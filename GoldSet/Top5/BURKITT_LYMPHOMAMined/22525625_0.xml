<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three distinct clinical forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> are recognized: endemic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is a rapidly growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: We described and analyzed our experience with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) diagnosis, treatment and outcome, during ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study; clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> between 1st January 1998 and 31st December 2008 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following data were collected: age at admission, gender, clinical presentation, and time elapsed from initial complaints until diagnosis, disease localization, treatment and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the time period 21 children were admitted (19 boys), seven (33.3%) of which were diagnosed in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was seven years with a mean delay to diagnosis of 20,8 days (range 2-125 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of primitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was the abdomen (13), followed by tonsils (three), orbit (one), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> (two), tongue (one) and nasopharynx (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients in our study were presenting with a painfull abdominal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was established through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> biopsy in 17 children, three by paracentesis or toracocentesis and one case was diagnosed only by genetic tests to the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic tests were positive in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the Murphy classification, there were three stage II, 12 stage III and six stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>; 29% and 19% had bone marrow and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One child relapsed and was successfully treated with RituximabÂ® and autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
