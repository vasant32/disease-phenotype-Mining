<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lymphokine, macrophage activation factor (MAF), is defined functionally as the factor that activates mouse macrophages to kill syngeneic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The source of MAF in this study is the Namalwa cell line, a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, that produces MAF as a constitutive product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial procedure in MAF characterization has been chromatography on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 6B-C1 column with the denaturating solvent, 6 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> HCl, pH 8.0, in order to reduce the copurification of MAF activity with serum proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Namalwa cells incubated in RPMI 1640 with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) produce MAF in the molecular weight ranges of 70,000 +/- 7000, 25,000 +/- 25000, 12,500 +/- 1250 and less than 10,000; while Namalwa cells, incubated in 10% FCS, produce activity at 12,500 daltons and below </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MAF active fraction from 10% FCS supernatant was reincubated in 10% FCS for 24 hr, and on rechromatography the MAF activity appears from 70,000 to 12,500 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reincubation in 6 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> moves the MAF activity to the column void volume (greater than 100,000 daltons) and to 70,000 daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in molecular size of MAF suggests that MAF consits of a small basic molecular unit (less than 10,000 daltons) which associates in larger molecular forms upon incubation at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
