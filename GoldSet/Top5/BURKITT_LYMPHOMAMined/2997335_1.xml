<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IFN-alpha (Le)-induced antiviral activity was slightly enhanced in cells treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> treatment alone did not show any antiviral effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed titer (OT) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in cells treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> together with IFN-alpha (Le) compared with the control without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> on IFN-alpha (Le)-induced cell growth inhibition was studied on Daudi (a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) and on G361 (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth of these cells was slightly suppressed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When cells were treated with IFN-alpha (Le)/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi>, the cell growth inhibition rates were significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than the rates obtained with IFN-alpha (Le) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> can enhance the antiviral as well as the antiproliferative activities of IFN-alpha (Le) in "in vitro" studies </plain></SENT>
