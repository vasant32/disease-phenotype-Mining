<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T cell targeting immunotherapy is now considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), and local recruitment of antileukemic T cells to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> microcompartment will then be essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This process is probably influenced by both intravascular as well as extravascular levels of T cell chemotactic chemokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that native human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells usually showed constitutive secretion of the chemotactic chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5, whereas CCL17 was only released for a subset of patients and at relatively low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coculture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells with nonleukemic stromal cells (i.e., fibroblasts, osteoblasts) increased CXCL10 and CCL17 levels whereas CCL5 levels were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a wide variation between patients in both CXCL10 and CCL5 levels persisted even in the presence of the stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutralization of CXCL10 and CCL5 inhibited T cell migration in the presence of native human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serum CCL17 and CXCL10 levels varied between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients and were determined by disease status (both chemokines) as well as patient age, chemotherapy and complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (only CCL17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, extravascular as well as intravascular levels of T cell chemotactic chemokines show a considerable variation between patients that may be important for T cell recruitment and the effects of antileukemic T cell reactivity in local <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> compartments </plain></SENT>
