<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This treatment was followed by increases in the percentage of early antigen (in both Raji and P3HR-1 cells) and virus capsid antigen-positive cells (in P3HR-1 cells) and increases of approximately 20-fold in the average number of EBV DNA equivalents in superinfected Raji cells and in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>-induced P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the content of EBNA in these cells dropped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was revealed by a decrease in both the complement-fixing antigen content and in the proportion of EBNA-positive cells as determined by anti-complement immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the positive correlation found previously between the content of EBNA and the number of EBV genome equivalents per cell in proliferating lymphoblastoid cultures does not seem to apply to the situation in either superinfected Raji cells or in P3HR-1 cells induced by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
