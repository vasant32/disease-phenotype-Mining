<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) in adults has been the subject of numerous case-control and cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposures in children diagnosed with NHL have been lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group conducted a study comparing 268 children who developed NHL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with bulk disease with a group of matched, randomly selected regional population controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The telephone interviews of both the case and control mothers included selected questions regarding occupational and home exposures to pesticides around the time of the index pregnancy and exposure of the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association was found between risk of NHL and increased frequency of reported <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use in the home (odds ratio [OR] = 7.3 for use most days; trend P = 0.05), professional exterminations within the home (OR = 3.0; P = 0.002), and postnatal exposure (OR = 2.4; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated risks were found for T-cell and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>; for lymphoblastic, large cell, and Burkitt <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp>; and in both young (age &lt; 6 years) and older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increased risk of NHL with occupational exposure to pesticides (OR = 1.7) that was not significant overall, but that was significant for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (OR = 9.6; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study provide further evidence linking <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure to the risk of NHL, but the authors were unable to implicate any specific agent </plain></SENT>
