<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 4-drug regimen (regimen 1, modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, Oncorin [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> [COMP] ) was compared with a 10-drug regimen (regimen 2, modified LSA2-L2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the Rappaport classification, the review pathologist diagnosed the 213 evaluable tissue specimens as follows: lymphoblastic (LC), 73; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt's tumor</z:e> (BT), 40; "undifferentiated" non-Burkitt's type (NB), 67; large cell or "histiocytic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (HI), 29; and other types (OT), 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concurrence in classification between the review and institutional pathologists was poor when using the above four categories; however, concurrence was 88% between the review pathologist and other hematopathologists, and 99% when classifying the specimens as lymphoblastic or nonlymphoblastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients with nonlocalized disease, this randomized controlled study demonstrated a new important correlation of histopathology with the effectiveness of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When analyzed without stratification into lymphoblastic and nonlymphoblastic types, the two regimens showed identical relapse free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) curves for patients with nonlocalized involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when patients were stratified according to histologic classification, regimen 2 was superior to regimen 1 for patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, achieving 74% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> at 30 months compared to 31% for regimen 1 (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, those with nonlymphoblastic types (BT, NB, HI) treated with regimen 1 had a 58% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> at 30 months compared to 32% for those treated on regimen 2 (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that proper, routine histopathologic classification of NHL is the best criterion for choice of therapy in children with nonlocalized involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a result of this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with nonlocalized disease, diagnosed after August 1980, were no longer randomized but were assigned to the appropriate treatment regimen based on prospective review of histopathology </plain></SENT>
