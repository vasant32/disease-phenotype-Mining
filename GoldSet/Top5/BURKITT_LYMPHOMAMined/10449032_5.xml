<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The panel included 15 nodal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, nine mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PARP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in control tissues and corresponded with the amount of PARP protein, as assessed by immunoblot analysis in six samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of PARP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was positively correlated with that of p53 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of PARP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3, suggesting that PARP expression levels are independent of the proliferation rate of neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this setting, the strong correlation between PARP and p53 suggests that the high expression of PARP may be associated with ongoing DNA damage in high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
