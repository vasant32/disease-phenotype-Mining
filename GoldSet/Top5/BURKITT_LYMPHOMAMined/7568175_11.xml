<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that the membrane-associated CD19-Lyn receptor-enzyme complex plays a pivotal role for survival and clonogenicity of immature B-cell precursors from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients, but its significance for mature B-lineage lymphoid cells (e.g., B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD19-associated Lyn kinase can be selectively targeted and inhibited with B43-Gen, a CD19 receptor-specific immunoconjugate containing the naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> (Gen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now present experimental evidence that targeting the membrane-associated CD19-Lyn complex in vitro with B43-Gen triggers rapid apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in highly radiation-resistant p53-Bax- Ramos-BT B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 protein without affecting the Bcl-2 expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic potential of this membrane-directed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction strategy was examined in a scid mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> of radiation-resistant high-grade human B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, in vivo treatment of scid mice challenged with an invariably fatal number of Ramos-BT cells with B43-Gen at a dose level &lt; 1/10 the maximum tolerated dose resulted in 70% long-term event-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results provide unprecedented evidence that the membrane-associated anti-apoptotic CD19-Lyn complex may be at least as important as Bcl-2/Bax ratio for survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
