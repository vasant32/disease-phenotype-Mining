<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA has been detected in several human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of HHV-6-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, from which a cell line, designated Katata, has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Katata cells had an immature B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> with an L3 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and carried a t(8;14)(q24;q32) chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HHV-6 DNA sequences were detected in both the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and Katata cell line by polymerase chain reaction using three sets of primers that target different regions of HHV-6 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of HHV-6 DNA in Katata cells was also shown by Southern blot hybridization with the BamHI fragment of HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the virus is in a latent state, since (1) virion-associated protein was not expressed in Katata cells, (2) transcriptional level of the immediate-early gene was very low, and (3) no <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles were observed by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Katata cells were highly tumorigenic in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells also contained HHV-6 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have successfully obtained several clonal lines by allowing the cells to form colonies in soft <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and by the limiting dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HHV-6 DNA was detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 clones analyzed, suggesting that virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Katata cells are infected with HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a case of HHV-6+ Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in the absence of Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there has been no report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines that are persistently and nonproductively infected with HHV-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Katata Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, therefore, would provide a useful tool for studies of the mechanisms of HHV-6 latency and reactivation </plain></SENT>
