<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice are increasingly used as hosts for the adoptive transfer of human lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human antibody responses can be obtained in these xenogeneic chimeras, but information about the functionality of the human T cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice is limited and controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies using human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) injected intraperitoneally (IP) into <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice (hu-PBL-<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice) have shown that human T cells from these chimeras are anergic and have a defective signaling via the T-cell receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, their antigenic repertoire is limited to xenoreactive clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the functionality of human T cell in a recently described chimeric model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this system, BALB/c mice are conditioned by irradiation and then transplanted with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> bone marrow, followed by IP injection of human PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our experiments demonstrated that human T cells, recovered from these hu-PBL-BALB mice within 1 month posttransplant, proliferated and expressed activation markers upon stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A vigorous antiallogeneic human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response could be generated in these mice by immunizing them with irradiated allogeneic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti-human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HIV-1) Net-specific human CTLs could be generated in vivo from naive lymphocytes by immunization of mouse-human chimeras with a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e>-nef virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This model may be used to evaluate potential immunomodulatory drugs or cytokines, and could provide a relevant model for testing HIV vaccines, for production of antiviral T-cell clones for adoptive therapy, and for studying human T-cell responses in vivo </plain></SENT>
