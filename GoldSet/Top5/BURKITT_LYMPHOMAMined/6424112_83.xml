<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied somatic cell hybrids between mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and JI Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carrying a t(2;8) chromosome translocation for the expression of human kappa chains. and for the presence and rearrangements of the human c-myc oncogene and kappa chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the c-myc oncogene is unrearranged and remains on the 8q+ chromosome of JI cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two rearranged C kappa genes were detected: the expressed allele on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 2 and the excluded kappa allele that was translocated from chromosome 2 to the involved chromosome 8 (8q+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of V kappa and C kappa genes in hybrid clones retaining different human chromosomes indicated that C kappa is distal to V kappa on 2p and that the breakpoint in this Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is within the region carrying V kappa genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High levels of transcripts of the c-myc gene were found when it resided on the 8q+ chromosome but not on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 8, demonstrating that translocation of a kappa locus to region distal to the c-myc oncogene enhances c-myc transcription </plain></SENT>
