<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous experiments using gene transfer of plasmids with heterologous promoters identified an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene (BZLF1) whose product (ZEBRA) switches the virus from a latent to a replicative state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now studied expression of ZEBRA in lymphoid cells harboring either standard virus or a mixture of standard and defective (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> [het]) viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high-titer rabbit antiserum to a TrpE-BZLF1 fusion protein was used to identify ZEBRA expressed from standard and het EBV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These ZEBRA proteins could be distinguished from each other on the basis of their electrophoretic mobilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ZEBRA could not be detected in cells latently infected with standard EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, within 6 h after induction of replication by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>, ZEBRA appeared and persisted long thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of ZEBRA was insensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> or acycloguanosine, behavior characteristic of an early replicative protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ZEBRA was constitutively expressed in cells containing both defective and standard EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ZEBRA was made predominantly from the het genome but also from the standard genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control of BZLF1 expression appears to occur at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No BZLF1-specific transcript was detected in cells containing only standard latent EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BZLF1 transcripts could be detected in these cells if virus replication was induced by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cells bearing both standard and het genomes did not require addition of an exogenous inducing agent to transcribe the BZLF1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The experiments suggest that regulation of transcription of the BZLF1 gene is a pivotal event in the control of EBV replication </plain></SENT>
