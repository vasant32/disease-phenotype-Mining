<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gamma-herpesvirus, EBV, is reliably found in a latent state in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single EBV gene product, Epstein-Barr nuclear Ag 1 (EBNA1), is expressed at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms prevent immune recognition of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, including a block in EBNA1 presentation to CD8(+) killer T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, no EBV-specific immune response has yet been found to target Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now find that EBNA1-specific, Th1 CD4(+) cytotoxic T cells recognize Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) T cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of EBNA1 are predominantly found in the C-terminal, episome-binding domain of EBNA1, and approximately 0.5% of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells are specific for EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, adaptive immunity can be directed against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and perhaps this role for CD4(+) Th1 cells extends to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that escape MHC class I presentation </plain></SENT>
