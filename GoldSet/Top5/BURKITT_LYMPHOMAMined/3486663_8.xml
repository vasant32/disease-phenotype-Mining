<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were evaluated with this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LI induction by these sera increased in proportion to their antiviral activity on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these sera did not induce LI; they showed no antiviral activity on the MDBK cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically and serologically, their donors were in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two sera induced the formation of LI that exceeded the maximum frequencies obtained with 3 alpha-interferon preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These sera had the greatest antiviral activities, and their donors had the greatest disease activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antisera to alpha-interferons prevented the induction of LI with the pure and homogeneous recombinant human leukocyte interferon, IFLrA, and SLE sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these results provide evidence that the alpha-interferon endogenous to SLE patients has a great ability to induce LI, and the SLE serum induction of LI corresponds well to the patient's disease activity </plain></SENT>
