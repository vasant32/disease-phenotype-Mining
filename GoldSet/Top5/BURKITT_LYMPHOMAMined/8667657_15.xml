<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite its rarity by routine karyotypic analysis, cryptic t(12;21)(p12-13;q22) translocation leading to <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 fusion has been recognized as the most frequent genetic rearrangement in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) in two recent studies, one from France and the other from the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To estimate the frequency of this abnormality in the Chinese population, we studied 41 children with ALL and 17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in two medical centers in Taiwan, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of this analysis demonstrated a 17% frequency of this translocation in the ALL population overall and 19% in patients with B-lineage ALL, similar to previous findings in Caucasian children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> had <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 fusion transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to its association with the B-lineage immunophenotype, <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 was also correlated with a low presenting leukocyte count and favorable age (1-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings, combined with earlier reports, indicate that <z:chebi fb="18" ids="30182">TEL</z:chebi>/AML1 fusion is the most frequent genetic abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, regardless of race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of t(12;21)-positive ALL may identify a subgroup of patients who do not require intensive treatment for cure </plain></SENT>
