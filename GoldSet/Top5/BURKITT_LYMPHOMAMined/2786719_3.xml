<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Northern and Western blot analyses clearly showed the expression, both at the transcriptional and translational level, of the LTA4 hydrolase gene in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, expression of the 5-lipoxygenase gene was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the genes coding for the two enzymes required for biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, 5-lipoxygenase and LTA4 hydrolase, were differentially expressed in the Raji cells </plain></SENT>
