<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred twenty-seven eligible patients with standard-risk early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> were registered onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred sixteen patients attained a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 114 patients were randomized to a different regimen and were the subject of a separate report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six hundred two patients were randomized to receive one the following regimens: intermediate-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (IDMTX) with leucovorin rescue on weeks 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22 (regimen A); regimen A plus asparaginase (ASP) administered intramuscularly (i.m.) weekly for 24 weeks (regimen B); or regimen A plus a 24-hour infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (AraC) with each IDMTX (regimen C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After consolidation, patients were placed on maintenance therapy through week 156 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regimens A and C were opened in February 1986, and regimen B in May 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons are based on concurrently randomized patients (May 1987 to January 1991 between regimens A and B, and February 1986 to January 1991 between regimens A and C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year continuous CR (CCR) rates were not significantly different: A versus B, 78.1% (3.9 +/- SE) versus 83.3% +/- 3.5% and A versus C, 79.4% +/- 3.2% versus 83.5% +/- 2.9%; P by one-sided log-rank tests were .27 and .34, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant treatment differences were not found with regard to sex, rate of testicular and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> relapse, or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During consolidation, regimen C had significantly more <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (P = .0032) and days spent in the hospital (P &lt; .001) compared with regimen A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We were unable to show a statistical advantage of adding either ASP or AraC to IDMTX in terms of improvement in event-free survival (EFS) </plain></SENT>
