<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 52 children with newly diagnosed ALL, BCL-2 expression in leukemic lymphoblasts ranged widely, from 4,464 to 59,753 molecules of equivalent soluble <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi> per cell (MESF), as determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- SD) level of MESF in 43 cases of B-lineage ALL (19,410 +/- 11,834) was higher than that detected in CD10+ B-lymphoid progenitors from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (450 +/- 314; P &lt; .001), and CD19+ peripheral blood B lymphocytes (7,617 +/- 1,731; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of BCL-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> cases (17,909 +/- 18,691) were also generally higher than those found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD1a+ thymocytes (1,762 +/- 670), or in peripheral blood T lymphocytes (9,687 +/- 3,019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although higher levels of BCL-2 corresponded to higher leukemic cell recoveries after culture in serum-free medium, they did not correlate with higher cell recoveries after culture on stromal layers, or with in vitro resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, 6-thioguanine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, teniposide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BCL-2 protein levels did not correlate with presenting clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, however, lower-than-median MESF values were significantly associated with the presence of chromosomal translocations (P = .010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases with the Philadelphia chromosome, a known high-risk feature, had low levels of BCL-2 expression (P = .022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of BCL-2 were not associated with poorer responses to therapy among 33 uniformly treated patients, and were not observed in three patients studied at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased BCL-2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> appears to enhance the ability of lymphoblasts to survive without essential trophic factors, and is inversely related to the presence of chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it does not reflect increased disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> or resistance to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
