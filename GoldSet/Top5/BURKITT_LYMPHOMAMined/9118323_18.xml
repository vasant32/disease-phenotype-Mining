<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the isolation and localization of RLCR1, a rat G-protein-coupled receptor, which is the homologue (94% amino acid identity) of the bovine receptor (LCR1) isolated from a locus coeruleus cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequence of the RLCR1 encodes a protein of 347 amino acids and yields a hydropathicity profile characteristic of receptors with seven putative transmembrane regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure of the receptor protein encoded by RLCR1 is most similar to that of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 2 (43% identical) and C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> corresponding to the cDNA was detected in various rat tissues including spleen, liver, heart, and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization analysis shows that RLCR1 is distributed both in neurons and glia in the adult rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of RLCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are highest in the ependymal layer as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that RLCR1 is also expressed at lower levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding that LCR1 is expressed in the adult indicates that this receptor influences neuronal function at times after maturation of the brain </plain></SENT>
