<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were mostly females, with a median age of 59 yr, presenting a rapidly growing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005994'>nodular goiter</z:hpo> with or without cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, without symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for 81% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto thyroiditis</z:hpo> was observed in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six different subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were observed: 13 of 26 (50%) had diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 6 (23%) mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 3 (12%) had follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2 (7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, 1 (4%) had small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and 1 (4%) had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients presented a compressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005987'>multinodular goiter</z:hpo>, cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> (66%), disseminated disease (50%), and poor performance status, with a poor prognosis (5-yr survival at 44%) despite a treatment based on a multidrug regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> arose in patients with previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677607" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hashimoto disease</z:e>, was localized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1, and was biologically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> and a high level of serum antithyroid antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With total thyroidectomy, prognosis was good (5-yr survival at 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not find any routine clinical or biological parameters that could predict the evolution from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> to MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we confirmed the histological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of TL corresponding to different clinical presentations and different prognoses </plain></SENT>
