<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> (MPCs) carry an Ig/myc translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any one of the three Ig loci may participate, while the myc contribution has been limited to c-myc, excluding other members of the myc gene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same is true for the other two known Ig/myc translocation-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the Ig/myc juxtaposition plays a decisive, rate limiting role in the genesis of the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, acting through the constitutive activation of myc that makes it refractory to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the molecular analysis of a unique t(6;12)(CI;B) translocation that we previously identified in an exceptional MPC that expressed N-myc but not c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We now show that the translocation led to the juxtaposition of N-myc and Ig kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first case of an Ig/myc-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> that involves N-myc rather than c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the translocation may already have occurred at the pro- or pre-B cell stage at which N-myc is open for transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to this interpretation, constitutive activation of N-myc would suppress the expression of c-myc, but would not interfere with the differentiation of the pro-B cell into a fully mature plasma cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its tumorigenic influence would become manifest only at the time when the cell would normally be programmed to leave the cycling compartment, in connection with its terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
