<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 3 out of 15 cell lines were capable of inducing IFN in the mixed leukocyte/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell reaction (MLTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>K562, a pluripotent stem cell line and DUTKO-I, a hybrid between K562 and Daudi (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) induced high levels of antiviral activity (ranging from 50-440 units IFN/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PUTKO-I, a hybrid between K562 and P3HR-I (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) induced very low levels of IFN (10 units/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This antiviral activity was produced by HLA-DR + adherent cells as revealed by different cell separation techniques, and shared well-known properties of IFN gamma (isoelectric point, inactivation by anti-human IFN gamma antibodies; species-restricted protection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MLTR-induced IFN induction could be blocked by enzyme treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, but was still present when glutaraldehyde-fixed cells were used for induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the cells by flow cytometry for expression of glycophorin A (GpA) revealed that expression of GpA correlated with the ability to induce antiviral activity in MLTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, isolated GpA could be used as a stimulant as well and the response to either K562 cells or soluble GpA was enhanced up to ten-fold by the addition of a GpA-specific monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
