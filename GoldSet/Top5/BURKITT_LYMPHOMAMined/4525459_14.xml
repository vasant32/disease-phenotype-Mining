<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From previous studies, lymphocyte DNA from human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and DNA from involved tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> contain sequences that are absent from their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These sequences are related to those found in particulate elements associated with these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> and possessing biochemical properties characteristic of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar observations have been made of unique sequences related to those of the feline virus RD-114 and found in spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_350'>mastocytomas</z:mpath> in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we extend these results to the classical murine model of virus-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Splenic DNA from BALB/c mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> induced by Rauscher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (RLV) possess some RLV-related sequences that do not exist in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BALB/c DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific sequences were absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other mouse strains examined, including AKR, a strain with a high incidence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DNA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> noninfected mouse strains possesses considerable homology with the RLV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Temperature denaturation studies indicate, however, that although the RLV-related sequences found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice are similar to each other, they are not exactly homologous with RLV sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RLV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in BALB/c results in the insertion of RLV sequences into cellular DNA that itself possesses only partial homology with the RLV genome </plain></SENT>
