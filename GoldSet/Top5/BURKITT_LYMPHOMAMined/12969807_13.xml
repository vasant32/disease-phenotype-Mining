<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chromosome translocations resulting in gene overexpression are commonly associated with lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor (TCR) loci are abnormally located in the vicinity of the entire coding sequences of genes which exert an influence on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maturation and differentiation program of lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A patient who presented with a B-cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> had a t(6;14)(p22;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and molecular findings confirmed the involvement of IgH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular cloning of the breakpoint revealed that this was located near the coding sequence of the Id4 gene, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) inhibitor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alu-repeated sequences at the 6p22 end flanked a short stretch of 10 bases shared by the 6p22 and 14q32 ends, suggesting that a deletion or a looping-Alu mediated mispairing mechanism may lead to this chromosome translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the Id4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was abnormally overexpressed in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the two smaller Id4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> products were detected (1.6 and 1.1 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of Id4 protein was also assayed in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marked overexpression was found in two cases of T-cell prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and in four B-cell lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> including one case with the t(8;14) and another case with a p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The Id4 gene may behave as an oncogene in some human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, perhaps through its capacity to sequester specific B-cell transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A genetic recombination between Alu-repeated sequences may not be the exclusive mechanism of generating pathogenic chromosomal translocations </plain></SENT>
