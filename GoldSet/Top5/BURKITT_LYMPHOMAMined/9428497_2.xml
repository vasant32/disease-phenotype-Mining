<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) immunotherapy is limited by microvascular endothelial cell (EC)-targeted injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction between rIL-2-activated lymphoid cells and EC is a possible mechanism of this systemic toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33706">beta-amino acid</z:chebi>, is known to have several physiologic actions, including the modulation of calcium homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> on rIL-2-activated, lymphocyte-mediated EC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell cytotoxicity and to investigate the mechanisms of its action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-2-activated cytotoxicity, mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, against susceptible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines and against EC (fresh EC and an EC cell line) in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> on lymphocyte [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i were assessed by flow cytometry, and the effects of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> on granzyme activity were assessed by spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors' findings indicated that the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> significantly reduced rIL-2-activated EC cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer cells, without reducing antitumor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">Taurine</z:chebi> was also shown to reduce significantly EC lysis mediated by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, while also significantly increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrated the importance of calcium in the role played by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> in lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and found that LAK [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]i following conjugation to EC was enhanced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also found that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> enhanced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent granzyme exocytosis from LAK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> may play a dual role in rIL-2 immunotherapy, due to its ability to reduce the vascular injury associated with this therapy while enhancing its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
