<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Titers of antibody to the capsid antigens larger than or equal to 10 were found in 84 percent of children aged two to five years, and the prevalence increased with age to nearly 100 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a positive but variable correlation of the prevalence of anti-capsid antigen reactivity with low socioeconomic status and crowding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An overrepresentation of high titers of antibody to capsid antigens was present in individuals with a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean titers of antibody to capsid antigens were highest in early childhood, lowest in adolescence and young adulthood, and high in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Females in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups and tonsillectomized children showed a higher geometric mean titer than their male and nontonsillectomized counterparts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to the early antigen complex were found rarely (8.2 percent) and only in sera with relatively high titers of antibody to capsid antigens </plain></SENT>
