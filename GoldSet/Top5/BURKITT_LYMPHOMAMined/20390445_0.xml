<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: As previous results were inconsistent, we assessed the association between maternal use of antibiotics during pregnancy or 3 months before conception and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> in the offspring in a large case-control study in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This population-based study on potential risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> was conducted by the German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Registry (GCCR) and included a total of 1,867 registered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases aged 0-14, diagnosed between October 1992 and September 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,057 controls were randomly drawn from population registries, matched by age, gender, and region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression models for frequency-matched datasets were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive statistically significant associations with self-reported maternal antibiotic use were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> (based on 59 mothers exposed to antibiotics, OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.06-2.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (18 exposed, OR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.83-5.62), and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (three exposed, OR = 5.89; 95% CI: 1.47-23.69), but not other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some support for the hypothesis that maternal use of antibiotics increases the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although recall bias is a concern, it is unlikely that this fully explains the observed effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, the observed associations might be related to the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
