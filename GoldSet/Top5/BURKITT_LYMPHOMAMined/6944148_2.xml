<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group is small but quite representative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>60% of the patients had a clonal abnormality: a Philadelphia chromosome and chromosome #7 abnormalities were seen in one patient; a marked hypodiploid clone (32 chromosomes) and its duplicate was seen in another; hyperploidy of 49 chromosomes (+4 +17 +21) was seen in a third patient, and 3 patients were found to have a 6q-abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients had an L3, Burkitt-type of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A translocation t(8;14) has frequently been found in this type of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings confirm the nonrandomness of particular cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL and the possibility of the existence of different aberrations in apparently identical clinical entities </plain></SENT>
