<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By means of anti-BrdU monoclonal antibodies and [3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>] incorporation a reduced proliferation rate was shown both through a combination of TNF alpha with either IL-1 alpha or IFN alpha and, above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, through simultaneous treatment with the three cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the degree of differentiation was evaluated via morphological criteria and detection of Fc receptors (FcR) and appeared higher after treatment with the three cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence of the increased sensitivity of this cell line to this combined treatment supporting the existence of a synergistic interaction in inducing the antiproliferative and differentiative effects </plain></SENT>
