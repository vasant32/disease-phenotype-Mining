<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies with the mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> MOPC 315 (IgA, lambda 2) cell line, using <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> mutants that had deleted the productive alpha heavy (H)-chain gene, had shown that the excluded alpha constant-region (C alpha) allele in these cells is transcriptionally active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports from several laboratories have demonstrated that in many BALB/c mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp>, including MOPC 315, the DNA segment encoding the c-myc oncogene is translocated to a C alpha allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> coding strand of DNA for the c-myc gene is on the opposite strand from the immunoglobulin gene in this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now investigated the relationship between the c-myc translocation and transcriptional activity of excluded C alpha alleles in IgA- and IgG-producing mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that c-myc-C alpha recombination events correlate with demethylation and transcription of C alpha genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several novel C alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species are produced, which are transcribed from the immunoglobulin-gene sense strand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The larger C alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> appear to contain c-myc sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus the anti-sense strand of the c-myc gene provides a promoter for transcription of the C alpha gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that in other transformed cells with a c-myc-immunoglobulin gene translocation, including many Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, activation of the adjacent immunoglobulin gene would occur </plain></SENT>
