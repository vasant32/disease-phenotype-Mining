<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) can be generated from the bone marrow of most patients with B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If these antileukemia CTL are to be used for adoptive immunotherapy, they must have the capability to circulate, migrate through endothelium, home to the bone marrow, and, most importantly, lyse the leukemic cells in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-permissive bone marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that such antileukemia T-cell lines are overwhelmingly CD8(+) and exhibit an activated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a transendothelial chemotaxis assay with human endothelial cells, we observed that these T cells can be recruited and transmigrate through vascular and bone marrow endothelium and that these transmigrated cells preserve their capacity to lyse leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these antileukemia T-cell lines are capable of adhering to autologous stromal cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, autologous antileukemia CTL specifically lyse leukemic cells even in the presence of autologous marrow stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these antileukemia T-cell lines do not lyse autologous stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the capacity to generate anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific T-cell lines coupled with the present findings that such cells can migrate, adhere, and function in the presence of the marrow microenvironment enable the development of clinical studies of adoptive transfer of antileukemia CTL for the treatment of ALL </plain></SENT>
