<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The radiographic evaluation of 18 children with American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 (67Ga) scintigraphy, done in 12 children, was interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in only three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other nine children, 67Ga scans demonstrated more sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involvement than any other method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment abdominal computed tomography and sonography were valuable for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo>, density and size of the liver and spleen, renal involvement, and the presence of lymphomatous soft-tissue masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sonography was less accurate at localizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> deposits, but more sensitive to small amounts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any of these methods is an effective way of following response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it appears that sequential 67Ga scintigraphy may have significant prognostic value, as those children whose scintigrams reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 6 months have survived </plain></SENT>
