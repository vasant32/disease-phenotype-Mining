<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Dok1 is an adaptor tyrosine kinase substrate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding Dok1 maps to human chromosome 2p13, which is frequently rearranged in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported a frameshift mutation of this gene and the down-regulation of its expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have determined the expression levels of Dok1 in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines, lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative (XLP-LCL), or from control healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also screened for Dok1 gene mutations by heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dok1 expression was down-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and XLP-LCL cell lines in comparison to the control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No Dok1 mutation or polymorphism was found in the coding region of Dok1 in the three types of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of four nucleotide changes in Dok1 gene, T(90172)C (intron 1), C(89487)T and (89433)InsCTCT (intron 2), and A(87714)G (3' UTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T(90172)C and (89433)InsCTCT that were detected in about 7% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 9% of XLP-LCL and 4% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples may represent a common polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C(89487)T and A(87714)G changes were detected in 9 and 6% of analyzed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, respectively, but never in the control and XLP-LCL cells, indicating that these nucleotide substitution occurred during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the C(89487)T variant is associated with a significantly lower level of Dok1 expression compared to the control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A positive association was also found between the presence of EBV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and the Dok1 genetic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data show that Dok1 expression and structure are affected in a subset of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, suggesting its possible role in this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
