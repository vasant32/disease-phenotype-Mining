<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a detailed protocol for a modular and generally applicable scheme to select aptamers that target the subpopulations of cells in which you are interested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fluorescence-activated cell-sorting device is used to simultaneously differentiate and separate those subpopulations of cells having bound and unbound aptamers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are fewer false positives when using this approach in comparison with other cell-selection approaches in which unspecific binding of nucleic acids to cells with reduced membrane integrity or their unselective uptake by dead cells occurs more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protocol provides a state-of-the-art approach for identifying aptamers that selectively target virtually any cell type under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As an example, we provide the step-by-step protocol targeting CD19(+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, starting from the pre-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential amplification) measurements to establish suitable SELEX conditions and ending at completion of the SELEX procedure, which reveals the enriched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> library </plain></SENT>
