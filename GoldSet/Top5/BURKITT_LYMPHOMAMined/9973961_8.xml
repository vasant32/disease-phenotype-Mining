<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency, pathologic findings, and clinical course of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with 19p13 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients with t(1;19) (q23;p13) and one patient with t(17;19)(q21;p13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with ALL, were identified over an 8-year period from among 183 adult ALL patients (2.7%); t(1;19) was observed in 2.2% and t(17;19) in 0.5% of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The seven patients (four females and three males) ranged from 18 to 59 years of age (median 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had a precursor-B cell immunophenotype, and a distinctive expression of surface markers (CD10, CD19, TdT, and HLA-Dr positive, usually negative for CD20, CD34, and negative for myeloid-associated antigens CD13, CD14, and CD33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blast cells in one case expressed CD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with combination chemotherapy and three patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had early (range 6-20 months) relapses, and died due to progressive disease 7-29 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar to pediatric patients, adults with 19p13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> usually do not respond to intensive therapy and have short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis of this group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> patients highlights the importance of detecting 19p13 translocations by cytogenetic analysis or molecular studies </plain></SENT>
