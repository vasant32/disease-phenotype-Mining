<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase analysis by immunoprecipitation, under denaturing conditions, reveals a half-life of 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is due to turnover in the plasma membrane with cleavage of the protein, resulting in a 25,000-molecular-weight (p25) fragment derived from the carboxy-terminal portion of LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This fragment is rich in proline and acidic amino acids and sheds into the cytoplasm, where it appears to accumulate, being present in a six- to sevenfold molar excess over p63/LMP in immunoprecipitation analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>p25 is, like p63/LMP, also phosphorylated (pp25) on serine and threonine residues, in the same ratio and to approximately the same extent as the intact p63/LMP molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amino acid sequence analysis and carboxy-terminal labeling suggest that p25 is derived through a single cleavage adjacent to the sequence LGAPGGGPDNGPQDPD </plain></SENT>
