<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed 1185 allogeneic transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported to the EBMT registry between 1982 and 1998 and compared the results with those of 14687 autologous procedures performed over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving allogeneic transplants were subdivided according to histology: low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) 231 patients; intermediate-grade NHL 147 patients; high-grade NHL 255 patients; lymphoblastic NHL 314 patients; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 71 patients; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> 167 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients received allogeneic transplants as their first transplant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actuarial overall survival (OS) at 4 years from transplantation was: low-grade NHL 51.1%; intermediate-grade NHL 38.3%; high-grade NHL 41.2%; lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 42.0% years; Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 37.1%; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> 24.7% years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These outcomes are relatively poor because of the high procedure-related mortality associated with these procedures, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (51.7% actuarial procedure-related mortality at 4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> apart from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, status at transplantation significantly affected outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A matched analysis was performed: for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, OS was better for autologous than for allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse rate was better in the allogeneic group for low-, intermediate- and high-grade, and lymphoblastic NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was equivalent for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and worse in the allogeneic group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic transplantation appears to be superior to autologous procedures in terms of producing a lower relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of allogeneic procedures must however be reduced before this translates into an improvement in OS </plain></SENT>
