<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations with rates of 10(-5)--10(-3) per base pair per generation, about 10(6)-fold above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, are targeted primarily at V-region hot spots by unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have measured <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of DNA polymerases iota, eta, and zeta by using cultured Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells exhibit 5-10-fold increases in heavy-chain V-region mutations targeted only predominantly to RGYW (R = A or G, Y = C or T, W = T or A) hot spots if costimulated with T cells and IgM crosslinking, the presumed in vivo requirements for SHM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An approximately 4-fold increase pol iota <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> occurs within 12 h when cocultured with T cells and surface IgM crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction of pols eta and zeta occur with T cells, IgM crosslinking, or both stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fidelity of pol iota was measured at RGYW hot- and non-hot-spot sequences situated at nicks, gaps, and double-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pol iota formed T x G mispairs at a frequency of 10(-2), consistent with SHM-generated C to T transitions, with a 3-fold increased error rate in hot- vs. non-hot-spot sequences for the single-nucleotide overhang </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The T cell and IgM crosslinking-dependent induction of pol iota at 12 h may indicate an SHM "triggering" event has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, pols iota, eta, and zeta are present under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions, suggesting that their presence is not sufficient to generate mutations because both T cell and IgM stimuli are required for SHM induction </plain></SENT>
