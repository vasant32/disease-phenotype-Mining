<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, short and intensive chemotherapy appears to have improved disease outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore reviewed the results of four successive Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group trials conducted on 470 children with disseminated Burkitt's and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the patients studied, the median age was 8 years (0-21 years), the male:female ratio was 4:1, 58% had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; or = 500 IU/l, 23% had M2 or M3 bone marrow (BM), and 12% demonstrated central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, the 4-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients &gt; or = 15-years-old compared with &lt; 15-year-old was 34 +/- 7 versus 59 +/- 2% (P &lt; 0.05), the 4-year EFS of M2/M3 compared with M1 BM was 38 +/- 5 versus 63 +/- 3% (P &lt; 0.001), and the 4-year EFS with LDH &gt; or = 500 IU/l compared with LDH &lt; 500 IU/l was 49 +/- 3 versus 71 +/- 4% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients treated on the most recent protocol, which was short and more intensive, had a significantly improved survival compared with those on previous trials (4-year EFS 80 +/- 6 versus 54 +/- 2%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the outcome for childhood Burkitt's and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> has recently improved with the use of short and intensive B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-directed therapy </plain></SENT>
