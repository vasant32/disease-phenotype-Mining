<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sera tested showed substantial increase of the anti-MA activity in the retained fraction, resulting in a significantly increased mean titer, EBV neutralizing activity did not change at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> after identical treatment or changed only in a random fashion, resulting in stable mean titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that anti-MA and neutralizing antibodies are directed against at least partly different antigens on the virus </plain></SENT>
