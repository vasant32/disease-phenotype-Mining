<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immobilized metal-ion affinity partitioning (IMAP) is shown to be useful as a preliminary screening test and for the separation of different cell populations based upon recognition of the differences in the proteins on cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of using IMAP to segregate a spectrum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cells (red blood cells, lymphocytes and fibroblasts) from their counterpart pathological cells has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clear segregation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sickle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> red blood cells (RBC), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> (Plasmodium vivax) infected RBCs was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the partition differences were found to depend on the nature and the concentrations of metal used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and those from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> showed differences in their partition pattern as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts when <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IDA-M(II) was added to the phase system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum differences between the three cell populations were observed in the presence of 10% <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IDA-Ni(II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji and Namalwa cell lines) were shown to partition differently in the presence of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IDA-M(II) in the phase system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes could be distinguished from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three phases (top, interface and bottom), in the presence of 10% <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-IDA-Ni(II) in the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences in the partition behavior could mainly be attributed to the density, surface exposure and micro-environment of histidine residues of cell membrane-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data, along with those obtained for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological human cells show that IMAP could be a simple and versatile tool for the segregation and study of cells </plain></SENT>
