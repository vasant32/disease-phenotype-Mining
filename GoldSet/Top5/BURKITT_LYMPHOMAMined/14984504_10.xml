<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether intracellular signal transduction molecules can be used as immunohistological markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic human leucocytes in routine tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We obtained selective labelling of white cells for eight such molecules (the 'linker' molecules SLP-76 and BLNK, the Src family kinases Lyn, Fyn, Syk and Hck, and the phospholipases PLC-gamma1 and PLC-gamma2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to SLP-76 and PLC-gamma1 selectively labelled T cells, and antibodies to BLNK, Lyn, Fyn, Syk and PLC-gamma2 labelled B cells (although Fyn immunostaining was restricted to mantle zone B cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to the Syk and Hck kinases labelled probable thymocyte precursors at the periphery of the thymic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to lymphoid cells, several other leucocyte types were immunostained (e.g. SLP-76, Lyn, Syk and Hck were found in megakaryocytes, myeloid cells and/or macrophages, and PLC-gamma2 was detected in arterial endothelium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SLP-76 and PLC-gamma1 were found in most T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> studied, and some B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were also positive for PLC-gamma1 (e.g. diffuse large cell and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The five B cell-associated markers were found in most B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, although some diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were negative (e.g. for Lyn) and anti-Fyn tended not to stain small B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observation that a range of leucocyte signalling molecules can be detected in routine biopsies offers new possibilities for studying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic human white cells in diagnostic tissue samples </plain></SENT>
