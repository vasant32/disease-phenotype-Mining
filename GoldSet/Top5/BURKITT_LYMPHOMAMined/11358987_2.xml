<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which EBV-LMP-1 promotes the expression of IFN-gamma has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that murine interleukin (IL)-18 was consistently expressed in regressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e> but was either expressed at low levels or absent from progressively growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 were only rarely expressed in regressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In splenocyte cultures, EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cells and LMP-1-transfected Burkitt cells promoted the expression of IL-18 but not the expression of IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence for IL-18 expression in response to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency protein and suggest that IL-18 may play an important role as an endogenous inducer of IFN-gamma expression, thereby contributing to <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
