<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been previously observed that the exact localization of the breakpoints at chromosome 8q24 can vary significantly from patient to patient, scattering over a distance of more than 300 kb upstream of c-myc and about 300 kb downstream of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To generate probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that detect most c-myc translocations, we screened a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes by colony hybridization, using three markers surrounding the c-myc gene as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained 10 YAC clones ranging in size between 500 and 200 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two nonchimeric clones were used for FISH on several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and patient samples with different breakpoints at 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the YAC clones detected translocations scattered along approximately 200 kb in both metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, rapidity, and feasibility in nondividing cells render FISH an important diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the use of large DNA fragments such as YACs greatly simplifies the detection of translocations with widely scattered breakpoints such as these seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
