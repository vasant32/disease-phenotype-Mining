<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human B-cell lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (LCL) or from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) were compared for their sensitivity to natural (NK) and interferon (IFN)-activated (IAK) cytotoxicity, mediated by effector cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four cases, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and an LCL line were derived from the same donor and had been kept in culture for the same period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> series included both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying and EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter were compared with their own EBV-converted, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)- and EBV-DNA-positive sublines, established by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with two different <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> substrains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines from the same donor were lysed with equal efficiency by both NK and IAK effectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the NK sensitivity and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse tumorigenicity of different EBV-converted Ramos sublines, or the expression of differentiation markers such as insulin receptor, surface IgD, and the B2 surface antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, EBV-converted sublines of BJAB differed in their NK sensitivity, in spite of closely similar expression of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK-sensitive Ramos and BJAB sublines induced a stronger proliferative response upon confrontation with allogeneic lymphocytes than their NK-resistant counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the target cell may play an active role in triggering the lytic interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between this property and any of the other parameters studied </plain></SENT>
