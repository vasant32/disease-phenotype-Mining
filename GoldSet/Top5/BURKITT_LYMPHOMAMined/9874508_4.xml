<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known for its ability to accumulate in inflammatory lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intracellular distribution and the uptake mechanism of Ga-67 remains a subject of discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we studied the mechanism of Ga-67 uptake in 4 human lymphoid cell lines: 38658, Jurkat, DG75 and U715 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results have pointed out the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of Ga-67 uptake among these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry analysis, we reported the expression of transferrin-receptor (TfR) in each lymphoid cell line, and found a positive correlation between TfR density and the Ga-67 uptake (r = 0.99) in lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-TfR monoclonal antibody (MoAb) blocked significantly the Ga-67 uptake in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymphoid cell lines indicating the Ga-67 uptake as a TfR-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mechanism has been saturated with different cold <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total inhibition of Ga-67 uptake was obtained at a 10(-4) M cold <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To conclude, we have shown that the Ga-67 uptake is TfR-dependent in lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> penetrates in lymphoid cells by an active mechanism which can be saturated </plain></SENT>
