<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong links between this agent and the chain of events causing two human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, have long been evident (reviewed in ref </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of this, and because of the very high incidence of nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in certain large populations, it was suggested in 1976 that a vaccine should be developed against EB virus to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and thereby reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> incidence amongst those at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The virus-determined membrane antigen (MA) was proposed as immunogen because it was known to elicit naturally occurring virus-neutralizing antibodies in man and because analogous antigens had been shown to act as effective experimental vaccines for preventing the herpesvirus-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Marek's disease</z:e> in chickens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progress has been achieved in defining, quantifying and preparing MA molecules, and in enhancing their immunogenicity; a sensitive assay for antibodies to MA has been elaborated </plain></SENT>
