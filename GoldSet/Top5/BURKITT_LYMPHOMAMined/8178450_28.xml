<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported earlier that variable expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded membrane protein LMP 1 in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and the host-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell-phenotype</z:mp>-dependent activity of the BCR2 promoter (one of the possible initiator sites for transcripts of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens) in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines can be related to the methylation status of the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of the BNLF 1 and BCR2 promoter, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that clones of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Mutu that differ in expression of LMP 1 also show a differential methylation pattern of the LMP 1 regulatory sequences: this region is hypomethylated in an LMP 1 expressing (group III) clone but methylated in a group I clone that does not express LMP 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We introduced in vitro methylated reporter plasmids carrying BNLF 1 and BCR2 enhancer-promoter sequences into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line Raji and found that overall methylation of 5'-CG-3' sequences by the Spiroplasma methylase Sssl significantly reduced their activity compared to unmethylated or mock-methylated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation of 5-CCGG-3' sequences by Hpall methyltransferase gave similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, methylation of 5'GCGC-3' sequences by Hhall methyltransferase gave similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, methylation of 5'-GCGC-3' sequences by Hpal methyltransferase resulted only in a moderate reduction of BNLF 1 enhancer-promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the notion that methylation at discrete sites within control regions of latent, growth-transformation associated EBV genes may contribute to silencing their expression </plain></SENT>
