<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This band corresponds to a 300-350-kDa DNA-PK found previously in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the 300-kDa phosphoprotein, the band of a highly phosphorylated 58-kDa protein was detected by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>/PAGE of partially purified DNA-PK preparations after the phosphorylation reaction in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phosphoprotein was specifically immunoprecipitated by phosphoprotein nor detectable activities of other kinases, phosphorylated recombinant c-Myc proteins in the presence of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The c-Myc phosphorylation by DNA-PK was markedly stimulated by relaxed, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, but neither by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> nor by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphopeptide mapping and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26051">phosphoamino acid</z:chebi> analysis indicated that DNA-PK phosphorylates c-Myc in vitro at several serine residues </plain></SENT>
