<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been postulated that inactivated beta1-integrins are involved in the disordered growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found that TNIIIA2, a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> derived from tenascin-C, strongly activates beta1-integrins through binding with syndecan-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that Ramos Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can survive and grow in suspension but undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when kept adhering to fibronectin by stimulation with TNIIIA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other integrin activators, Mg(2+) and TS2/16 (an integrin-activating antibody), were also capable of inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inactivation of ERK1/2 and Akt and the subsequent activation of Bad were involved in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results using other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cell lines expressing different levels of fibronectin receptors (VLA-4 and VLA-5) showed that potentiated and sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to fibronectin via VLA-4 causally induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> also in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cells in addition to Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because TNIIIA2 requires syndecan-4 as a membrane receptor for activation of beta1-integrins, it induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> preferentially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic tumor</z:e> cells, which expressed both VLA-4 and syndecan-4 as membrane receptors mediating the effects of fibronectin and TNIIIA2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, which poorly expressed syndecan-4, were almost insusceptible to TNIIIA2-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TNIIIA2-related matricryptic site of TN-C could contribute, once exposed, to preventing prolonged survival of hematopoietic malignant progenitors through potentiated and sustained activation of VLA-4 </plain></SENT>
