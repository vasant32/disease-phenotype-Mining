<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histopathological diagnosis was checked using common paraffin material, and a basic clinicopathological correlations was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the Burkitt type was characterized by a diffuse type of growth with striking cellular cohesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the cytological aspect it was uniform with minimal differences in cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of macrophages forming a "starry-sky" phenomenon was constant in the bioptic material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is, however, not specific for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In necroptic material macrophages were often absent and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells was altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the differential diagnosis it is necessary to differentiate in particular malignant lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and monomorphous centroblastomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The malignant of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> type was localized in the majority of patients in the abdominal cavity, less frequently on the neck and in Waldeyer's ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mediastinum was not primarily affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients survive for 16-52 months after termination of oncological therapy without a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients died from generalization of the process, or from complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight of those who died had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> in the abdominal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the bioptic diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 3.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As to the primary localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> and some other clinical and pathological data, various authors differ--these differences are discussed in relation to possible variations in the distribution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> under different geographical conditions </plain></SENT>
