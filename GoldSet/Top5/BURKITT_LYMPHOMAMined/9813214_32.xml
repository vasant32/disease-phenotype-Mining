<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a serine-to-alanine mutation of Z residue 186 (within the basic DNA binding domain) was shown to inhibit the ability of Z to induce lytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in latently infected cells, although the Z(S186A) mutant could still bind several known ZREs and activated an early EBV promoter (BMRF1) in transient reporter gene assays (Francis, A </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We now show that a specific deficiency in the ability to bind to ZRE elements in the immediate-early BRLF1 promoter may account for the inability of Z(S186A) to activate BRLF1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ability of Z(S186A) to induce early BMRF1 and BHRF1 gene expression is rescued by cotransfection with a BRLF1 expression vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the Z(S186A)/BRLF1 (R) combination cannot induce full lytic replication, suggesting that Z(S186A) may also be deficient in a replication-specific function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in the context of the intact <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, both Z and R expression are required for activation of early gene transcription in latently infected cells </plain></SENT>
