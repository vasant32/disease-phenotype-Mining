<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a useful marker for lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow and thymus and for lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To simplify and enhance the detection and phenotypic analysis of these cells, we sought to develop monoclonal antibodies to this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain antibodies that bind a variety of mammalian TdTs, mice were immunized with bovine TdT and the hybridoma secretions were screened by immunofluorescence assays on cultured TdT-positive and negative human lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four monoclonal antibodies which bound specifically to TdT-positive lymphoblasts were characterized in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four antibodies immunoprecipitated the native 60 kd TdT molecule from extracts of TdT-positive human lymphoblasts and bound specifically in immunoblot assays to the 43.8 and 11 kd proteolytic fragments of bovine thymus TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the antibodies bound to related or distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on bovine TdT, we measured the displacement of radiolabeled antibody from the immobilized enzyme by an excess of unlabeled heterologous antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed that three of the antibodies competed for the same determinant on bovine TdT, while one antibody reacted with a distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, however, partially inhibited the enzymatic activity of bovine TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specificity for TdT was tested by immunofluorescence and competition radioimmunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these assays, the antibodies did not stain a variety of known TdT-negative human hematopoietic cells and cell lines. both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic, nor were the antibodies displaced from purified bovine TdT by extracts of these TdT-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed the cross-reactivity of the antibodies with human and bovine TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To assess cross-reactivity with TdT from other species, extracts of rabbit, mouse, and rat thymus were prepared and shown to specifically displace the antibodies from bovine TdT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, these antibodies bound to TdT derived from at least five mammalian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these antibodies could be used to detect small subpopulations of TdT-positive cells, mixtures of TdT-positive and negative cells were prepared and stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> conjugates of the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When assayed by flow cytometry, a population of 1% TdT-positive cells was easily detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these monoclonal antibodies should be useful for the enumeration and analysis of TdT-positive cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic hematopoietic tissues from several mammalian sources, including man </plain></SENT>
