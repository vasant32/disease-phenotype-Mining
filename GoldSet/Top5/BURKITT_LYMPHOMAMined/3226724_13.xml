<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To learn about the sequence determinants controlling their turnover, we have studied naturally occurring and artificially constructed c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> rearranged in 5' or 3' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first conclusion is that sequences necessary for rapid c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> turnover are localized in their 3' untranslated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second conclusion is that stabilization of truncated c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> does not result from deletion of the non-coding first exon but rather from its replacement by intronic and/or exogenous sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This latter conclusion rests on two lines of evidence: (i) deleting the 5' rearranged sequences from the relatively stable MOPC 315 RNA restores its complete instability (pSV c-myc 1); (ii) reciprocally, appending intron 1 sequences 5' to otherwise unstable germline c-myc exons 2 and 3 have a dramatic stabilizing effect (pIM 0) </plain></SENT>
