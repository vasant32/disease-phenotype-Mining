<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) was artificially expressed by a constitutive expression vector, the Cp EBNA promoter remained inactive and accordingly the latency III program was not induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, expression of LMP2A and activity of the Fp lytic promoter were activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this Fp activity, the rate of spontaneous activation of the EBV replicative cycle was increased significantly, suggesting the possibility that EBNA2 can induce EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of anti-IgG-induced activation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication was reduced in Akata cells expressing EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To obtain more direct evidence for EBNA2-induced activation of the EBV replicative cycle, this protein was next expressed by a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulated expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBNA2 was undetectable with low doses (&lt;0.5 microgram/ml) of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>, while its expression was rapidly induced after removal of the antibiotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This induced expression of EBNA2 was immediately followed by expression of EBV replicative cycle proteins in up to 50% of the cells, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an unexpected potential of EBNA2 to disrupt EBV latency and to activate <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication </plain></SENT>
