<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The integrin VLA-4 is preferentially expressed by B cell precursors and mediates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of B cell precursors to bone marrow derived fibroblasts (BM-FB), which express a VLA-4 counter/receptor, VCAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional importance of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> interaction is suggested by the inhibition by anti-VLA-4 antibody of in vitro proliferation of B cell progenitor colonies grown with a BM-FB adherent layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> requirements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus neoplastic human B cell precursors, quantitative expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins by primary human B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) cells was studied by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCP-ALL cells expressed VLA-4 and VLA-5 at similar levels as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immature B cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, particularly CD44, were overexpressed by the leukemic cells relative to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell precursors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of BCP-ALL cells to BM-FB was inhibited by antibodies to VLA-4 and VCAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the ordered program of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> protein expression and functional activation during B cell development is at least partially intact in BCP-ALL cells, and may play a role in tissue localization and growth of the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The focal pattern of spreading of adherent BCP-ALL cell lines on individual cells in the BM-FB adherent layer suggests functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the bone marrow microenvironment that may be essential in regulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic lymphopoiesis </plain></SENT>
