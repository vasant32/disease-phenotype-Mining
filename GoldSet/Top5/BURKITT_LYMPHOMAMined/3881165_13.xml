<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cell lines were established from 15 patients with diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DHL) of the intermediate grade, diffuse large cell (class G), and high-grade, large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (class H) types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunologic studies indicated that 11 of the 15 DHL cell lines were B cell in origin, 2 were histiocytic, and 2 were null cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies revealed 1 hypodiploid, 11 hyperdiploid, and 3 near-tetraploid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosome #7 was trisomic in 3 lines, chromosomes #12 in 4 lines, and chromosome #13 in 3 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome #2 was monosomic in 3 lines, chromosome #8 was monosomic in 5 lines, chromosome #14 in 4 lines, and chromosome #22 in 6 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is of special interest, as chromosomes #2, #8, #14, and #22 are clearly concerned with rearrangements in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and immunoglobulin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common rearrangement in the DHL cell lines involved chromosome #14 at band 14q32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the pattern of translocation in DHL is between chromosome #14 and usually chromosome #11 or chromosome #18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 14;18 translocation is not restricted to patients with low-grade follicular, small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, as has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 14q+ chromosome is characteristic of lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is due, invariably, to a translocation with the breakpoint in band 14q32, which is the locus of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that in each translocation, for example, chromosomes #11 or #18, an oncogene may be transposed onto chromosome #14, and that each 14q+ translocation in DHL represents an event that transposes an oncogene from another chromosome to chromosome #14 </plain></SENT>
