<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases were processed for electron microscopy and analyzed by using computerized image analysis techniques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dissimilarities (p less than 0.05) included the means of nuclear perimeter, SD of nuclear perimeter, nuclear area, SD of nuclear area, cellular area, SD of cellular area, cytoplasmic area, SD of cytoplasmic area, SD of form factor, and nucleolar frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiparameter analysis clearly separated these 18 patients into two distinct groups and confirms that the subtleties used in the histologic classification of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes are meaningful </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> case was of a pre-pre-B phenotype and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> case was of pre-B phenotype </plain></SENT>
