<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD54 is a cell surface adhesive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, which is expressed in most cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interaction between CD54 and its ligands is involved in several cellular events including activation, proliferation, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and also cell-to-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that cross-linking of CD54 on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Raji and Ramos, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated that cross-linking of CD54 on Raji and Ramos using immobilized anti-CD54 mAb (clone 6.5B5) leads to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD54-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> took place in association with an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a loss of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential and also the activation of caspases 3 and 9, resulting in the degradation of the proteolytic poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of each N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">cystein</z:chebi> and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (a broad caspase inhibitor) blocked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of CD54 immediately induced expression of fasL, which was inhibited by pretreatment of N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">cystein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NOK-1 (antagonistic anti-fasL), ZB4 (antagonistic anti-fas), and N-benzyloxycarbonyl<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">-Ile</z:chebi>-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethylketon (caspase 8 inhibitor) effectively rescued cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via adjacent fas-fasL interaction but did not block ROS generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it is concluded that engagement of CD54 on B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines by anti-CD54 mAb may trigger fasL expression through ROS generation and may subsequently induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in adjacent fas-fasL interaction </plain></SENT>
