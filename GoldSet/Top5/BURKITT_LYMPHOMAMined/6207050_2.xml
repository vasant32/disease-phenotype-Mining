<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although sequential immunoprecipitations appeared to demonstrate molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of transferrin receptors, since the Tü15-reactive species were fully included in the Tü67-positive population, but not vice versa, the possible association of Tü15-reactive molecules with transferrin receptor is also discussed </plain></SENT>
