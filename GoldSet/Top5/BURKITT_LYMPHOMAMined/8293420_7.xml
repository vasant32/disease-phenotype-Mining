<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mouse monoclonal anti-BAL antibody induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line within 2 days of incubation, after being crosslinked by a secondary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody specifically recognized a 37 kDa membrane protein that was expressed on a wide spectrum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cells, but induced programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in only very few of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have followed the initial kinetics of the antibody-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line KM-3, by microcalorimetric measurements in conjunction with determination of the cellular proliferation rate and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase in metabolic activity was observed already after incubating the cells for 20 min with crosslinked anti-BAL antibody, which was several hours before significant growth inhibition and DNA fragmentation were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data show for the first time that the initiation phase of antibody-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is an active, energy-dependent process and not merely an effect of receptor blocking </plain></SENT>
