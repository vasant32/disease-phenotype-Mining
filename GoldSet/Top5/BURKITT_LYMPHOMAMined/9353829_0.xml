<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was found in 7 of 25 (28%), a higher proportion than in two previous studies of mainly adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diploid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed S-phase fractions (SPFs) similar to those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the NHL cases <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> was found in 12 of 40 (30%) with no significant association with site, stage, histopathology, immunophenotype, or prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPFs were highest in abdominal and chest primary sites but were not related to stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had the highest SPFs relative to lymphoblastic (P &lt; .01) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516391" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">centroblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher SPFs were found in B cell than in T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for SPFs within each NHL subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was worse at 5 years for those with high SPFs compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SPFs (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA analysis may be useful in the evaluation of children with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to define its role as an independent prognostic variable </plain></SENT>
