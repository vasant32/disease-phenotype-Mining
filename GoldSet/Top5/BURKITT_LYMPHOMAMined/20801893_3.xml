<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-Myc oncoprotein is overexpressed in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and is essential for maintaining the proliferation of transformed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To function as a transcription factor, c-Myc must dimerize with Max via the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein (bHLH-ZIP) domains in each protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The small molecule 7-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-N-(2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35447">phenylphenyl</z:chebi>)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> (10074-G5) binds to and distorts the bHLH-ZIP domain of c-Myc, thereby inhibiting c-Myc/Max heterodimer formation and inhibiting its transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of 10074-G5 in human xenograft-bearing mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, 10074-G5 inhibited the growth of Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and disrupted c-Myc/Max dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>10074-G5 had no effect on the growth of Daudi xenografts in C.B-17 <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice that were treated with 20 mg/kg 10074-G5 intravenously for 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of c-Myc/Max dimerization in Daudi xenografts was not seen 2 or 24 h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of 10074-G5 in various matrices were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV, and metabolites of 10074-G5 were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma half-life of 10074-G5 in mice treated with 20 mg/kg i.v. was 37 min, and peak plasma concentration was 58 Î¼M, which was 10-fold higher than peak <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of antitumor activity probably was caused by the rapid metabolism of 10074-G5 to inactive metabolites, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> concentrations of 10074-G5 insufficient to inhibit c-Myc/Max dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our identification of 10074-G5 metabolites in mice will help design new, more metabolically stable small-molecule inhibitors of c-Myc </plain></SENT>
