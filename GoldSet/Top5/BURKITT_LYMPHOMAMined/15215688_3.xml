<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize the genotypes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) isolate present in North Africa, viruses were isolated from B-lymphoblastoid cell lines established from the saliva of both Algerian Nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) patients and EBV-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, Algerian Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and NPC biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By nucleotide sequence analysis, we showed that there were two specific missense mutations in an 89 bp region of EBNA2 gene at position 49390-49479 of the EBV genome: a mutation at 49449 (C--&gt;A) and another mutation at 49444 (T--&gt;C), changing their amino acid sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first mutation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell lines established from the saliva and 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, as well as the W91 cell line, while the second mutation was found in EBV isolates from NPC biopsies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and the M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi> isolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A PCR-RFLP analysis on the BamHI DNA fragment H showed that the Hl-H2-polymorphism was specifically associated with M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>-like mutation, while H-polymorphism was linked with W91-like mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter was not identified in NPC biopsies, but was found rather in saliva from NPC patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The M-<z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>-like mutation, on the other hand, was found in 100% of NPC biopsies and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that EBV with H1-H2-polymorphism is tightly implicated in NPC development in North Africa rather than EBV with H-polymorphism </plain></SENT>
