<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 15 ; 12 translocations found in most murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> and the analogous 8 ; 14 translocation in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> involve scissions of murine chromosome 15 (human chromosome 8) near the 5' end of the c-myc gene and subsequent fusion near an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The less well characterized 'variant' translocations found in about 15% of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> also involve the myc-bearing chromosome band, but exchange occurs with a chromosome bearing an immunoglobulin light-chain locus--in mice, the kappa-chain locus bearing chromosome 6 (refs 3-5) and, in man, chromosome 2 (or 22), at the same band at which the kappa (or lambda) locus lies (reviewed in ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt variant translocations involve scissions 3' of c-myc; one 8 ; 22 translocation placed the C lambda locus just 3' of c-myc, but usually the chromosome 8 breakpoint is a greater, but unknown, distance away from c-myc, more than 20 kilobases (kb) in one 8 ; 2 translocation involving the C kappa gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the murine 6 ; 15 translocations, although a C kappa gene cloned from one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (PC7183) is linked, via chromosome 12 sequences, to an unidentified region of chromosome 15 (ref </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We describe here the chromosome fusion region from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> ABPC4, which displays the typical reciprocal 6;15 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We find that the chromosome 6 breakpoint is near C kappa but, unlike those in the heavy-chain locus, not at a position where immunoglobulin genes normally recombine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the chromosome 15 sequences involved in the ABPC4 translocation are not derived from the vicinity of c-myc </plain></SENT>
