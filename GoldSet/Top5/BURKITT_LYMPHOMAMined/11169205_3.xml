<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to study the feasibility of the ex vivo expansion of gamma delta T cells from healthy individuals, and to determine their functional capacity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selectively expanded the peripheral gamma delta T cells of five donors against a <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line, XG-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under optimal conditions, the resulting bulk cultures comprised about 82% of the gamma delta T cells, more than 90% of which showed the T-cell receptor (TCR)-V gamma 9 delta 2 rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These gamma delta T-cell cultures exhibited TCR-gamma delta dependent cytotoxicity against different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines including Molt-4, BJAB, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoid cell lines (LCL), and the nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) cell lines, CNE2 and 915, in addition to the stimulator XG-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By competitive cytotoxicity assays, the gamma delta T cells demonstrated recognition of at least three distinct target specificities expressed by Molt-4, CNE2 and LCL, respectively, which were related to that expressed by the stimulator XG-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the specificity expressed by XG-7 and Molt-4 was further shown to require the participation of heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity expressed by CNE2 and 915 was preferentially recognized by the CD56 subset of gamma delta T cells, which could be sustained in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that gamma delta T-cell immunity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lines may be acquired in response to other types of tissue injury and, hence, implicates a role for their use in the prevention and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
