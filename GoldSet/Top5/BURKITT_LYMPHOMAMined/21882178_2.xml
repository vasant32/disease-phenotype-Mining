<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no established standard therapy for these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors assessed MYC status and correlated it with treatment response and outcome in a group of 52 patients with unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with either a standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> regimen (R-CHOP [rituximab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>-related therapy]) or more intensive regimens, such as R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab plus hyperfractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> alternating with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimens were selected by the treating clinicians based on the overall clinical and pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty (58%) unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> had MYC abnormalities (MYC(+) ) including 27 with rearrangement, 2 with amplification, and 1 with both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MYC(+) and MYC(-) groups were similar in their age distribution and International Prognostic Index scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival of patients with MYC(+) unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated initially with R-CHOP was significantly worse than patients treated with R-hyper-CVAD (P = .0358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for the MYC(-) unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group, some patients responded to R-CHOP, and others were refractory to R-hyper-CVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MYC aberrations are common in unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of MYC aberrations identifies a patient subset that requires more aggressive therapy than R-CHOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MYC(-) unclassifiable B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients responded variably to either R-CHOP or aggressive therapy, and the latter showed no survival advantage </plain></SENT>
