<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of disease was compared to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of childhood so that the most valuable modalities could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a rapidly growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in the child, making it essential to suggest the diagnosis as quickly as possible so that biopsy and treatment can be instigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary area of involvement was abdominal (15 of 19), gastrointestinal, intraperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp>, hepatic and pancreatic without retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>Pleural effusions</z:hpo> were common without hilar and mediastinal <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>adenopathy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of childhood where mediastinal and hilar disease in the chest and retroperitoneal node involvement in the abdomen are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus sonography is an excellent imaging modality, easily identifying the extent of the disease and so suggesting the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
