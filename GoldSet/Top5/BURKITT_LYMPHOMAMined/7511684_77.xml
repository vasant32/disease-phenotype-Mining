<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An influence of such responses on virus evolution was first suggested by our finding that EBV isolates from the highly HLA A11-positive Papua New Guinea (PNG) population carried a lys-thr mutation at residue 424 of the nuclear antigen EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA4) that destroyed the immunodominant target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> for A11-restricted CTL recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we turn to a much larger population, Southern Chinese, where the A11 allele is again present in over 50% of the individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of 23 EBV isolates analyzed from this population were also mutated in the EBNA4 416-424 epitope, the mutations selectively involving one of the two anchor residues in positions 2 (417 val-leu) or 9 (424 lys-asp, -arg or -thr) that are critical for A11-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the Chinese isolates and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 PNG isolates also carried mutations affecting positions 1 and 2 of the next most immunodominant A11-restricted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, EBNA4 residues 399-408 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes clearly affected antigenicity since A11-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) carrying these mutant EBV strains were not recognized by A11-restricted CTLs raised against the prototype B95.8 virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Chinese donors naturally infected with these mutant viruses did not mount detectable A11-restricted CTL responses on in vitro stimulation with autologous LCL cells carrying either the B95.8 or their endogenous EBV strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two different highly A11-positive populations, therefore, immune pressure appears to have selected for resident EBV strains lacking immunodominant A11-restricted CTL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
