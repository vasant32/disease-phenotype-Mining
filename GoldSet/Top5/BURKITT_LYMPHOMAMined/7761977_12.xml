<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Daudi, a lymphoblastoid B cell line derived from an African Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> does not express HLA-A,B,C antigens at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although HLA-A,B,C heavy chains are made normally they do not assemble into functional molecules because beta 2-microglobulin is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous serological analysis of somatic cell hybrids indicated that the HLA haplotypes of Daudi encoded HLA-A1, A10(A26), B17, and B16(38) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the application of molecular methods: ARMS-PCR, cDNA cloning and sequencing, immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis, to define the class I genotype of the Daudi cell line which is HLA-A*0102, A*6601, B*5801, B*5802, Cw*0302 and Cw*0602 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the B38 antigen, which is not a product of the alleles defined, the genotype is consistent with the serological description </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two previously undiscovered alleles emerged from this analysis: A*0102 and B*5802 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The A*0102 allele differs from A*0101 by 5 nucleotide substitutions within exon 2 where it has a motif shared with A*30 alleles; the B*5802 allele differs from B*5801 by 3 substitutions in exon 3 where it has a motif shared with B*14 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subtyping HLA-A1 alleles showed A*0102 was well represented amongst individuals typed serologically as A1 in an African population but was absent from caucasoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B*5802 has been found in a second individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the novel A and B alleles are not specific to the Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, this analysis of a single East African cell illustrates the power of molecular methods to define new class I HLA alleles in non-caucasoid populations </plain></SENT>
