<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the relative rate of transcription across the Epstein-Barr virus genome in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji by nuclear run-on analysis during latency and after induction of an abortive lytic cycle with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During latency the entire, or almost the entire, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome was found to be transcriptionally active to a low or intermediate extent, with some variation in activity along the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fragment with the highest transcriptional activity was EcoRI J, which contains the genes encoding the small nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> EBER1 and -2, transcribed predominantly by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An intermediate level of transcription was observed between positions 10 and 138 (kb), with areas of slightly higher activity on the large internal repeats and the left duplicated region (DL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining part of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, between position 138 and the termini, and the termini and position 10 (kb) (with the exception of the EcoRI J fragment), showed very little transcriptional activity, except for the intermediately active regions carrying the righthand oriLyt (DR) and the terminal repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon induction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and IUdR, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome was transcriptionally active at a rate at least tenfold that seen during latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Polymerases were not equally distributed along the genome after induction; the highest density was found in regions 48 to 58 kb, 82 to 84 kb, 102 to 104 kb, 118 to 122 kb and 142 to 145 kb of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High transcriptional activity correlated with distinct transcription units in some cases, i.e. BamHI H1LF1 (DL), BamHI MLF1, BamHI ZLF1/BamHI RLF1 and BamHI X (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase), but not in others (BamHI H2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides initiation of transcription, other regulatory processes such as stabilization and processing of primary transcripts may also contribute to regulation of virus gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> completely abolished the transcriptional activation of the genome mediated by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and IUdR </plain></SENT>
