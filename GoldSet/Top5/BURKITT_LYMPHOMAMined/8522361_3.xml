<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression of the protooncogene c-fos is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C, cAMP, and calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kinase C mediates its effects via phosphorylation of serum response factor (SRF) which interacts with the serum response element (SRE); cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP regulatory element binding protein) presumably by activation of a protein kinase A or calmodulin-regulated kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the function of these elements in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Ramos and Daudi) as well as a T lymphocytic cell line (Jurkat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on c-fos induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, kinase C activation (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> stimulation) combined with either cAMP (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> plus MIX) or calcium stimulation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>) leads to greatly enhanced c-fos induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in c-fos induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">Okadaic acid</z:chebi> augments <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>- as well as calcium-mediated activation of c-fos, and has little or no effect when combined with cAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main difference between Ramos (B cells) and Jurkat (T cells) in the regulation of c-fos is that cAMP plus calcium is strongly synergistic in Jurkat and is without effect in Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of AP-1 activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of AP-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Signaling in B cells due to anti-Ig stimulation involves both kinase C activation and release of intracellular calcium, and results in c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that synergy between the kinase C activation and calcium is needed for efficient c-fos induction since neither of these two alone induces c-fos well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the anti-Ig induction of c-fos is supported by the fact that cAMP-inducing agents and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> further enhance anti-Ig induction of c-fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cell-specific patterns of synergy are an essential feature for c-fos induction and may be relevant for c-fos control through B and T cell antigen receptors </plain></SENT>
