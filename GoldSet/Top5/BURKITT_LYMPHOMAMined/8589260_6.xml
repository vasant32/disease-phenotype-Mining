<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In human interleukin 4(IL-4), the carboxyl and amino termini of the 129 amino acid hormone are close to each other and this region is believed to be important for binding to the IL-4 receptor (IL-4r) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We constructed plasmids encoding circularly permuted IL-4 mutants with the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Gly-Gly<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi>-Gly-Gly (GGNGG) joining the carboxyl to the amino terminus and with new amino and carboxyl termini elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutant IL-4(38-37) is composed of IL-4 residues 38-129 GGNGG and 1-37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant IL-4(105-104) is composed of IL-4 residues 105-129, GGNGG and 1-104 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-4(38-37) and IL-4(105-104) were purified from E. coli to near homogeneity and retained 50-100% of the binding and proliferative activity of IL-4, and in addition retained the ability to upregulate CD23 on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circular dichroism studies indicated that the tertiary structures of both IL-4(38-37) and IL-4(105-104) were retained, with the former molecule most similar to native IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that while both native termini of IL-4 may be near its binding site, neither is required to be free for optimum activity </plain></SENT>
