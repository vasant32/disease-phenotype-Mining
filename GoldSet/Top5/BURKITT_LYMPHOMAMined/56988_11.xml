<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug at present is thought to be primarily cell cycle phase specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to eliminate undesirable side effects (mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>) occurring with a bolus dose and to confirm the recent findings of the relative stability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>'s solution with preserved biologic and antitumor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study we determined that a dose of 150 mg/m2/day given as a 120-hour continuous iv infusion and repeated at 28-day intervals produced safe, manageable, and reproducible toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug was freshly prepared at 4-hour intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven courses were administered to seven patients at this dose level and no patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> was the major toxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antitumor activity was shown in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and another with American Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
