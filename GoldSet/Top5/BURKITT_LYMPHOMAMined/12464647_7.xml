<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with malignant and nonmalignant diseases, its lytic replication is predominantly associated with nonmalignant diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lytic replication is also associated with type B EBV more than with type A EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sustained lytic replication, however, is not compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether control of an EBV lytic regulatory gene, BZLF1, differed in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize the promoter sequence of BZLF1 (Zp) in 52 tumors (34 non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 13 post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> samples, and five nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>), and in peripheral blood lymphocytes from seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active EBV, six with IM, and 40 healthy, EBV-seropositive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sequences were compared with the prototype EBV strain B95.8 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three polymorphic Zp sequences were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the malignant samples, sequence Zp-P, associated with 84% of type A EBV, was identical to that of EBV strain B95.8, whereas a second sequence (Zp-V3), associated exclusively with type B EBV (P&lt;.001), contained three base substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the nonmalignant samples, a distinct polymorphism, Zp-V4, containing the substitutions detected in Zp-V3 and an additional base change, was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active EBV, IM, and healthy individuals, but in none of the malignant samples (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Zp-V4 was independent of the EBV type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences of BZLF1 are differentially distributed among malignant and nonmalignant cells and may identify EBV subtypes with various lytic activities, including those not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
