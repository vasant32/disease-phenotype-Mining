<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of patient-specific immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangements were used as targets for semi-quantitative estimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> levels: &gt; or =10(-2), 10(-3), &lt; or =10(-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine relapsing ALL patients were matched with the same number of controls by using white blood cell count (WBC), age, sex, and time in first complete remission, as matching factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> was evaluated at time-point 1 (end of protocol Ia of induction treatment, ie 6 weeks from diagnosis) and time-point 2 (before consolidation treatment, ie 3 months from diagnosis) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>-based high risk cases experienced a significantly higher relapse rate than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients, according to the estimated seven-fold increase in the odds of failure, and a much higher rate than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>-based low risk patients (OR = 35.7; P= 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the Cox model, the prediction of the relapse-free interval at 4 years was 44.7%, 76.4% and 97.7% according to the different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> categories </plain></SENT>
