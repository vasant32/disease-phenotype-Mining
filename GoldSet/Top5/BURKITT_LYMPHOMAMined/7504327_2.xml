<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although possibly exposed to HLA-A2 by transfusions, the cell donor showed no HLA-A2-specific serum antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present protocol for in vitro immunization includes the elimination of suppressor cells from the responder cell population, the presence of irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes as a source of antigen, as well as stimuli--recombinant interleukin-2 and a B-cell specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogue--causing the proliferation of B lymphocytes, prior to immortalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of the antibody 5C2A2 to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known HLA-A2 subtypes, except A2.3, and A28, allows identification of the serological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on the HLA-A2 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of this in vitro immunization method allows the production of a set of HLA monoclonal antibody-secreting human hybridomas, independent of the existence of serum HLA antibodies in the lymphocyte donors </plain></SENT>
