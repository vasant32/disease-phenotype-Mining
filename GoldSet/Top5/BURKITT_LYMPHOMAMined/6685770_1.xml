<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two targets having the conformationally mobile <z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> spacer group, namely, 2,2'-ethylenebis[6-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24712">hydroxymethyl</z:chebi>)-p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi>] diacetate (3b) and 2,2'-ethylenebis[6-(bromomethyl)-p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi>] (3c), were studied in vivo and in vitro using an established epithelial/Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> hybrid cell line (D98/HR1) previously shown to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inactivity of both test compounds in vitro, the relative resistance of these cells to test drugs in vitro, and the selective antitumor properties of the bis(bromomethyl) analogue in vivo lead to the proposal that this compound undergoes bioreduction to an alkylating species in the hypoxic core of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, thereby exerting its action </plain></SENT>
