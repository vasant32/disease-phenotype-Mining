<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is essential for EBV-induced transformation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and contributes to maintenance of latency in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line P3HR1-c16, which lacks LMP1 during latency and which can readily be activated into virus-productive lytic cycle, we found that LMP1 inhibits lytic cycle induction via the transcription factor NF-kappa B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, LMP1 inhibits lytic cycle progress via two distinct NF-kappa B-independent mechanisms: one involving the cytosolic C-terminal activating regions and the other involving the transmembrane region of LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that in B cells EBV self-limits its lytic cycle via three distinct LMP1-mediated mechanisms </plain></SENT>
