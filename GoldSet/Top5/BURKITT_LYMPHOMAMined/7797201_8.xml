<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a strong association (approximately 95%) of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whereas the association is weak for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form occurring in Western countries (approximately 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Middle East, North Africa and South America, 60-80% of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> harbour EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These epidemiological differences suggest that either the endemicity of EBV or socio-economic conditions, or both, may influence the pathogenetic role of EBV in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since only meagre data are available on Asians, this study was performed to address this issue by studying cases from Hong Kong, where EBV seroconversion occurs in the first few years of life but the socio-economic conditions approach those of Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization for EBV encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) was performed on paraffin sections of 18 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Labelling of the neoplastic cells was detected in five cases (27.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among 54 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of various subtypes studied for comparison, signals for EBER were detected in only one case each of T-cell-rich large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and Reed-Sternberg-like cells occurring in B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strong labelling with oligo-dT probe (which hybridized with the polyadenylated ends of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases suggested that the negative results were genuine and not due to poor preservation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, among B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> occurring in Chinese, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> shows a statistically stronger association (P &lt; 0.01) with EBV than with other types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
