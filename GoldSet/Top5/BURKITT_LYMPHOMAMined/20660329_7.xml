<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a cohort of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in our databases and retrospectively reviewed corresponding in-house flow cytometric data to determine whether a common immunophenotype might be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we report on our findings on 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, each with translocations involving c-MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 and show that these cases frequently showed a common immunophenotype that includes decreased expression of CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> often show aggressive biologic behavior and poor clinical outcome, recognition of this relatively common immunophenotype may be useful for identifying cases for confirmatory cytogenetic studies, as often, flow cytometry provides the first assessment of these clinical specimens </plain></SENT>
