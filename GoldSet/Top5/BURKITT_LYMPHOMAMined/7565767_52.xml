<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The promoter is active in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines but silent in many EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these latter cell lines, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> episome is hypermethylated in the vicinity of this promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that in such a cell line (Rael, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> inhibits DNA methyltransferase, brings about demethylation of EBV genomes, activates Cp transcription, and induces the expression of EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the phenomenon demonstrates the importance of the methylation status of a particular CpG site for the regulation of the Cp: (i) genomic sequencing shows that this site is methylated when the Cp is inactive and is not methylated when the promoter is active; (ii) methylation or transition mutation at this site abolishes complex formation with a cellular binding activity (CBF2) as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, competition binding analyses, and DNase I footprinting; and (iii) a single C --&gt; T transition mutation at this site is associated with a marked reduction (&gt; 50-fold) of transcriptional activity in a reporter plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the CBF2 binding activity is shown to be methylation sensitive and crucial to EBNA-2-mediated activation of the Cp </plain></SENT>
