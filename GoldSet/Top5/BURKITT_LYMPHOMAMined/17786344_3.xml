<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of Mina53 protein was found in &gt;80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with high expression of Mina53 had shorter survival, suggesting the prognostic usefulness of Mina53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied Mina53 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> subtypes to examine its diagnostic significance and its possible role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical cases of 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 4 non-neoplastic tissues were stained immunochemically using anti-Mina53 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mina53 expression correlated well with c-Myc expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting that c-Myc is a controlling factor for mina53 expression also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the expression of Mina53 as well as c-Myc was less frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> compared with those of colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESCC</z:e>, increased expression of Mina53 was found in Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1/1), Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (3/5), diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>) (5/13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with a transition from follicular to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (1/2), with none in follicular (0/4) and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (0/3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the data suggested that Mina53 was frequently expressed in aggressive types of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To get more information about the expression of Mina53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>, which most frequently occurs among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we analyzed the expression of Mina53 in another 21 DLBCL specimens, which were in more advanced stages than those described above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression level of Mina53 correlated to the international prognostic index (IPI) values with statistical significance (r=0.477, P=0.0275) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, in this group, Mina53 expression did not correlate with c-Myc expression, suggesting that other factor(s) besides c-Myc largely affect the expression of Mina53 in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that although Mina53 expression is not prominent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in general, it may be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
