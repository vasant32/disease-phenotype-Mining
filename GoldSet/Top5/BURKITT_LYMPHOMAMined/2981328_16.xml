<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody reacted with discrete patches in the nuclei of infected cells as well as with virus particles, as shown by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural immunoperoxidase staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of the protein precipitated by this monoclonal antibody was ca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>160,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen antibody-positive sera tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reacted with this purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of the antigen was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15732">phosphonoacetic acid</z:chebi> but was not affected by tunicamycin, indicating that this was a late nonglycosylated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted between the protein isolated from the P3HR-1 and B-95-8 cell lines as determined by immunoprecipitation and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By isoelectric focusing, this protein had a pI on the basic side ranging from 7.5 to 9.0 </plain></SENT>
