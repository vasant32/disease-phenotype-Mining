<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed our series of 53 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (1977 to 1990) to assess the role of surgery in their treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were 2.5 to 21 years of age (median, 9.5 years) and 44 were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary site of disease was the abdomen (38), head and neck (12), axilla (1), and bone marrow (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the 38 patients with abdominal primaries underwent laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> (right lower quadrant pain or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo>) and at exploration underwent resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of these 12 patients achieved grossly complete excision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (9 had disease limited to the ileocecal area and adjacent mesentery and one had exophytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> adherent to the liver, which was excised) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of note, only 1 of these 12 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> outside of the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 patients who underwent laparotomy had an incisional biopsy performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients who did not have a laparotomy, the diagnosis was made by bone marrow biopsy (6), and/or cytology of pleural fluid or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> (6), lymph node biopsy (1), testicular biopsy (1), tibial biopsy (1), and percutaneous biopsy (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Murphy staging for these 38 patients was: stage II (10), stage III (19), stage IV (5), and B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (4) </plain></SENT>
