<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incubation of K-562 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells with specific goat immunoglobulin resulted in gradual cytolysis in the absence of complement and effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal lysis (100%), reached in 3-4 days, occurred when the concentration of the antibody in the culture medium was about 20 micrograms/ml containing an initial inoculum of 15,000 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lower concentration (10 micrograms/15,000 cells/ml) led to partial cytolysis; the surviving cells, cultured in fresh medium, were still vulnerable to antibody lysis (30 micrograms/ml), thus indicating the lack of an apparent resistant cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of free antibody in the culture medium diminished rapidly and very little or none was detectable after 2-3 hours of incubation with K-562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immune gamma-globulin also inhibited colony formation of K-562 cells in soft agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immune gamma-globulin, absorbed extensively with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cells, to pluripotent K-562 cells, cross-reacted with several human malignant hematopoietic cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells included T-lymphoblasts (JM and MOLT-4), promyelocytes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (RAJI), myeloblasts (KG-1 and KG-1a), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cells (K-737) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absorption of the immune gamma-globulin with an equal number of cells from each of the cell lines assayed diminished but did not completely remove the antibody responsible for cytolysis of K-562 target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the K-562 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> blasts appear to possess common and specific antigens that may be only partially expressed on other committed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the cytolytic activity of the immune gamma-globulin could only be removed by absorption with K-562 cells possessing a complete array of antigens solely present on pluripotential hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
