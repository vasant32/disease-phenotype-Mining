<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The t(8;14)(q24;q32), involving MYC gene (8q24) and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (14q32), represents about 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> translocations in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the great variability of the breakpoint region, a standard polymerase chain reaction assay is not sufficient for the detection of this chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The availability of new and more efficient DNA polymerases that allow the amplification of genomic fragments many kilobase-pairs long, makes it possible to identify the t(8;14) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells by long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have established a simplified and efficient LD-PCR for the detection of t(8;14)(q24;q32) that relies on the use of one primer specific for MYC exon II combined, in different reactions, with four primers for the IgH locus: three for the constant regions Cmu, Cgamma, and Calpha, and one for the joining region (JH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first studied seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and optimized LD-PCR reaction for analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of seven cell lines were positive for the t(8;14), whereas two lines derived from endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were negative, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 15 biopsies obtained from pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and subsequently analyzed, 13 (87%) were positive for the translocation detected by LD-PCR and showed a product ranging in size from 2.0 to 9.5 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cmu region was involved in 6 cases, Cgamma and Calpha in 2 cases each, and JH in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 2 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> positive for JH showed a second, larger PCR product with the Calpha- and Cgamma-specific primer, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We established that our LD-PCR method could detect 10(-3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells within a population of hematopoietic cells lacking the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our LD-PCR method represents a fast, highly sensitive, and specific tool to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and to detect minimal disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> in patients affected by t(8;14)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
