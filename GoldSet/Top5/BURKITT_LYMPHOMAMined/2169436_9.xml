<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In isolated nuclei after 90 min of interferon treatment an enhanced rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi> phosphorylation and an increase of DAG mass were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In whole cells, after 1 min of interferon treatment, there was a rapid and transient shift of DAG mass apparently not related to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> modifications, thus indicating the presence in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions with different metabolic features in response to interferon-alpha </plain></SENT>
