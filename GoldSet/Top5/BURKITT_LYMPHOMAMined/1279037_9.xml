<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood from healthy adult persons served as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and blood from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> served as a non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies included 29 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 93 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and 105 healthy adult persons, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues from 13 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The great majority of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were from the face and neck regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from the blood of the majority of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as well as those from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, exhibited a reduced cap-forming ability (2-6%) and increased Con-A-induced agglutinability compared to lymphocytes from healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, although some of the lymphocytes from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> had a somewhat lower range of cap formation than the lymphocytes from healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the interaction with Con A of lymphocytes from the different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight lymphoid cell lines were established in our laboratory from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cap-forming ability and agglutinability by Con A of these lines was examined and compared to those of the "classical" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines: Raji, Daudi and P3HR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines exhibited an increased Con-A-induced agglutinability and a reduced cap-forming ability compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, except for P3HR1 cells which exhibited a cap-forming ability of 15-20% </plain></SENT>
