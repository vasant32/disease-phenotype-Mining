<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 35 BLs and identified atypical immunophenotypes in 4 including SIg light chain negativity in 4, negativity for B-cell antigens in 2, lack of CD10 in 1, and CD4 expression in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 cases showed morphologic features characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were confirmed by cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 4 BL cases included 1 girl, 2 men with HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, and a third man with a history of heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients died shortly after diagnosis; the other 2 completed hyperfractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> with highly active antiretroviral therapy and achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates that an unusual immunophenotype is not uncommon in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the immunophenotype is interpreted in isolation, the diagnosis could be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognizing the variability of immunophenotype is essential for establishing an accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
