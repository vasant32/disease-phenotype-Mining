<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (93.5%) of the patients had diffuse and 2 (6.5%) had nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffuse histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> accounted for 10 cases (32.3%), diffuse undifferentiated for 9 (29%), and diffuse lymphocytic, poorly differentiated for 5 (16.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five cases (16.1%) were unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cases of well-differenitated lymphocytic or mixed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified classification was attempted, which included also large basophilic cell (LBC), convoluted T-lymphocytic (CTL), and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These pathologic subgroups accounted for 35.4%, 16.1%, and 6.5% of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were almost equally divided between clinically localized and generalized stages, and their survival was stage-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 32.3%; the 3-year survival was 50% for Stages I and II, compared to 7.7% for Stages III and IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 22% of the cases, the disease originated in extra-lymphatic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> syste, involvement occurred in 10 of 31 children (32%), and a leukemic picture developed in 6 of 31 (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Ctl <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were confined to the mediastinum, whereas the LBC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arose mostly in Waldeyer's ring and Peyer's patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the extent of the disease as determined by clinical staging had prognostic significance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220612" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood NHL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of the histological classification could not be clearly established from our data </plain></SENT>
