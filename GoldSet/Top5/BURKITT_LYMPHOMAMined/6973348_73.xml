<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (CALLA) is expressed by leukemic cells from approximately 80% of patients with non-T-cell ALL and 30%-50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A small number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and fetal liver cells also express CALLA, but the functional role of this molecule is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have used a monoclonal antibody (J5) specific for CALLA to study the expression of this antigen in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, it was found the CALLA was expressed by almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt's and nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, CALLA was expressed in 40% of patients with lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 3 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and three of eight T-lymphoblast cell lines were also found to express CALLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> spleen, lymph node, and thymus cells were not reactive with J5 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that expression of CALLA is not limited to relatively undifferentiated leukemic lymphoblasts but also occurs in more differentiated lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiated lymphoid cells in lymph node, spleen, and thymus, which have a phenotype similar to that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, do not appear to express CALLA </plain></SENT>
