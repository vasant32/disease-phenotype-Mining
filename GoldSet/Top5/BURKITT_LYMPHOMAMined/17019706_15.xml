<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Holoendemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> has been identified as a co-factor in the etiology of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that eBL may cluster spatially within this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eBL cases diagnosed from 1999 through 2004 at Nyanza Provincial General Hospital were reviewed for case residential information to examine this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two cluster detection methods, Anselin's Local Moran test for spatial autocorrelation and a spatial scan test statistic, were applied to this residential data to determine whether statistically significant high- and low-risk areas were present in the Province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 6-year study period, 272 children were diagnosed with eBL, with an average annual incidence of 2.15 cases per 100,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Empirical Bayes smoothed rates, the Local Moran test identified 1 large multi-centered area of low eBL risk (p-values &lt; 0.01) and 2 significant multi-centered clusters of high eBL risk (p-values &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spatial scan detected 3 small independent low-risk areas (p-values &lt; 0.02) and 2 high-risk clusters (p-values = 0.001), both similar in location to those identified from the Local Moran analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant spatial clustering of elevated eBL risk in high-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> transmission regions and of reduced incidence where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> is infrequent suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> plays a role in the complex eBL etiology, but that additional factors are also likely involved </plain></SENT>
