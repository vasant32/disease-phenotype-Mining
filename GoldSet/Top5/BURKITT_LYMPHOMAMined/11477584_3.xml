<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells harboring latent virus and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells use monocistronic messages generated from the Q promoter (restricted strategy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-transformed immunoblasts express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBNAs by using giant messages generated from the W/C promoter (full program) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether the virus establishes the restricted program on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell (or its progenitor) or, alternatively, whether such cells are generated by phenotypic down-regulation from the immunoblast is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found previously that conversion of EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines to EBV-positive sublines required repeated exposure to large virus doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The converted sublines used the full program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility that cells with a full program had a selective advantage during the long period of in vitro passage could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore infected EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines with recombinant EBV carrying a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7507">neomycin</z:chebi> resistance marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most convertants of the 12 lines tested were positive for YUK splicing, indicative of the full program, but some were also positive for the restricted QUK splice program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One convertant DG75 line showing both YUK and QUK was cloned and gave rise to stable QUK users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines can give rise to subclones with either the full or the restricted program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBVs carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines use the restricted program in vitro may be a consequence of immunoselection </plain></SENT>
