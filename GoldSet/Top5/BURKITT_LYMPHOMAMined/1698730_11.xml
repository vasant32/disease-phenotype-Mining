<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The non-immortalizing EBV variant, P3HRI, which carries a deletion encompassing the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) gene, fails to induce any such expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that the EBV-mediated up-regulation of cell-surface expression of these molecules is associated with an increased level of the specific steady-state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> corresponding to these 2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the role of EBNA2 in B-cell growth and immortalization may be related to its role in transactivation of cellular genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to identify other cellular genes whose expression may be modulated by EBV, we analyzed the level of transcription of a set of genes possibly involved in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of the c-myc oncogene transcript was not significantly affected by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The c-fgr oncogene, thought to be specifically activated in EBV-infected cells, was found to be expressed in some EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and also to be activated by both non-immortalizing and immortalizing strains of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of vimentin, the major 56-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> of mesenchymal cell intermediate filaments, was altered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV isolates, in either a negative or a positive way, depending on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of lymphocyte-function-associated antigens, LFA-1 alpha/beta (CD11 a/18) and LFA-3 (CD58), involved in intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and the T-cytotoxic pathway, were differentially regulated by EBV; a crucial observation was the activation by immortalizing EBV isolates of LFA-1 beta chain (CD18) and of LFA-3 (CD58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EBV-and possibly EBNA2-associated modulation of cellular genes, such as CR2 (CD21), CD23 and LFAs, probably represents key events for EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, and also for in vivo immune control of EBV-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
