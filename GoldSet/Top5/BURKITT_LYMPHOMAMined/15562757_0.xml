<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used recombinant CD154 to stimulate EBV/LMP1 negative Ramos B cell and observed the effects of BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein in CD154-induced NF-kappaB luciferase activation, phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, phosphorylation of p65, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits upon CD154 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein abrogated CD154-induced NF-kappaB luciferase activation in Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While CD154-induced phosphorylation of p65, phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, and nuclear translocation of p50, p65, and c-Rel were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blocked by BAY11-7082; Lactacystein only inhibited degradation of IkappaB-alpha and p65 nuclear translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BAY11-7082 and Lactacystein inhibit CD154-induced NF-kappaB activation through different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
