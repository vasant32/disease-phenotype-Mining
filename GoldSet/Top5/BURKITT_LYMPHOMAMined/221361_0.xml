<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mouse/Burkitt hybrid cell, designated CL1D/HR-1, was cloned in soft agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each of 10 clones was assayed for the spontaneous expression of EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA), early antigen (EA) and virus capsid antigen (VCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of 10 clones were EBNA-positive but negative for EA and VCA even after treatment with iododeoxyuridine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One clone, designated M44, contained approximately 90% EBNA-positive cells and 0.3--0.5 EBV genome equivalents per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty subclones of clone M44 were obtained and analysed for EBV DNA, EBNA and human chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four subclones (three EBNA-positive and one EBNA-negative) were studied in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data obtained thus far indicate that none of the four subclones of clone M44 studied contained any intact human chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isozyme analysis of these subclones indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four subclones, regardless of the status of the EBV genome, synthesized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> phosphorylase, an enzyme which has been linked to human chromosome number 14 </plain></SENT>
