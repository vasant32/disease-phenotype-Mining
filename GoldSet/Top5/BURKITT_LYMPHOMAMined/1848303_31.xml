<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of these experiments was to develop strategies for creation and identification of recombinant mutant Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV recombinant molecular genetics has been limited to mutations within a short DNA segment deleted from a nontransforming EBV and an underlying strategy which relies on growth transformation of primary B lymphocytes for identification of recombinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, mutations outside the deletion or mutations which affect transformation cannot be easily recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these experiments we investigated whether a toxic drug resistance gene, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24753">hygromycin</z:chebi> phosphotransferase, driven by the simian virus 40 promoter can be recombined into the EBV genome and can function to identify B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells infected with recombinant virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different strategies were used to recombine the drug resistance marker into the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both utilized transfection of partially permissive, EBV-infected B95-8 cells and positive selection for cells which had incorporated a functional drug resistance gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments, B95-8 clones were screened for transfected DNA that had recombined into the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second series of experiments, the transfected drug resistance marker was linked to the plasmid and lytic EBV origins so that it was maintained as an episome and could recombine with the B95-8 EBV genome during virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recombinant EBV from either experiment could be recovered by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and toxic drug selection of EBV-negative B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EBV genome in these B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is frequently an episome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Virus genes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> of primary B lymphocytes are expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) and the EBNA-3 genes is variable relative to that of EBNA-1, as is characteristic of some naturally infected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the EBV-infected B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are often partially permissive for early replicative cycle gene expression and virus replication can be induced, in contrast to previously reported in vitro infected B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that dominant selectable markers can be inserted into the EBV genome, are active in the context of the EBV genome, and can be used to recover recombinant EBV in B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This system should be particularly useful for recovering EBV genomes with mutations in essential transforming genes </plain></SENT>
