<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Following our previous description of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter (SERT) acting as a conduit to 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>)-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, specifically in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we now detail its expression among a broad spectrum of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, while exploring additional SERT substrates for potential therapeutic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SERT was readily detected in derived B cell lines with origins as diverse as B cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, diffuse large B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentration and timecourse kinetics for the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> derivatives fenfluramine (an appetite suppressant) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="1391">3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi>; "Ecstasy") revealed them as being similar to the endogenous indoleamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressant</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47780">clomipramine</z:chebi>, instead mirrored the behavior of the selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, both being effective in the low micromolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A majority of neoplastic clones were sensitive to one or more of the serotonergic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysregulated bcl-2 expression, either by t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation or its introduction as a constitutively active transgene, provided protection from proapoptotic but not antiproliferative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate a potential for SERT as a novel anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target for <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> analogs, while evidence is presented that the seemingly more promising antidepressants are likely impacting malignant B cells independently of the transporter itself </plain></SENT>
