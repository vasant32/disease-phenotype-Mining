<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary observations on the efficacy in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> monotherapy (CPM) have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a multicentric prospective study combining first-line CPM and a multidrug second-line chemotherapy (SC) for refractory/relapsed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Patients â‰¤ 18 years with Burkitt or Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were included in six countries (Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, and Senegal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received three weekly CPM courses (1.2 g/m(2) IV with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>), stage 3/4 patients received three further courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SC added <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 178 patients included (42 stage 1/2, 134 stage 3/4, and 2 unknown) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated facial localization was found in 41 patients, diffuse abdominal involvement in 120 patients including 65 with both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported, toxicity occurred in 136/743 courses (83 patients) and was predominantly hematological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After CPM, complete remission (CR) rate was 47% with a 33% EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> 76/108 eligible patients (85 primary refractory and 23 relapses) received SC resulting in 35.7% CR but a 21% toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OS of the whole strategy was 50.5% and correlated to stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A prospective multicentric study on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was feasible in very low-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CPM can be recommended in stage 1-2 because of optimal cost/benefit ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, more intensive strategies, still adapted to socio-economic conditions, are required for advanced stages 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
