<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Infants were enrolled from 2 rural sites in Kenya: the Kisumu District, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> transmission is holoendemic and risk for eBL is high, and the Nandi District, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> transmission is limited and the risk for eBL is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from infants through 2 years of age to measure EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, EBV antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242723" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parasitemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a significantly younger age at time of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in children from Kisumu compared with children from Nandi (mean age, 7.28 months [±0.33 SEM] in Kisumu vs 8.39 months [±0.26 SEM] in Nandi), with 35.3% of children in Kisumu infected before 6 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To analyze how different predictors affected EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load over time, we performed multilevel mixed modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This modeling revealed that residence in Kisumu and younger age at first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> were significant predictors for having a higher EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load throughout the period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children from a region at high risk for eBL were infected very early in life with EBV, resulting in higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> loads throughout infancy </plain></SENT>
