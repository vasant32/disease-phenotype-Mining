<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience with an intraventricular concentration times time (C x T) chemotherapy regimen for recurrent meningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients (median age, 11.6 years) received C x T therapy for meningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 18), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 2), or undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior therapy included standard intrathecal (IT) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>, cranial or craniospinal radiation (median, 24 Gy), and 0-5 experimental treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C x T induction therapy consisted of 2 mg of intraventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> administered daily for 3 days every 10 days, for 4 courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were then consolidated with 4 courses of alternating intraventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (15 mg/day) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (2 mg/day) daily for 3 days every 2 weeks (2 courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and 2 courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maintenance therapy consisted of alternating monthly courses of C x T <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of patients (14 of 15) who were evaluable for response achieved a complete remission in a median of 10 days (range, 2-40 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median remission duration was 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> or systemic treatment-related complications; 2 patients are alive, off treatment, and in continuous complete remission for 59+ and 89+ months; 1 patient experienced a meningeal relapse at 24 months on C x T therapy but was reinduced with the C x T regimen, received craniospinal radiation, and is in remission at 142+ months; and 3 are alive with disease at 32+, 72+, and 81+ months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This regimen appears to be an effective and well-tolerated palliative treatment for patients with recurrent meningeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
