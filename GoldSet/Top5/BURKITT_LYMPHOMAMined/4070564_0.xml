<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a dose of 10 Gy, the increase in membrane permeability preceded the appearance of cells with diminished DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The synchronization of cells in phase G2 was associated with a virtually complete radiation arrest of mitoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postirradiation electrophoretic analysis of DNA of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and of Syrian and Chinese hamster fibroblasts showed that the DNA degradation is unordered and results perhaps from activation of hydrolases in the dead cells </plain></SENT>
