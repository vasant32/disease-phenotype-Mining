<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Latently infected <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-virus (KSHV)-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells have both endothelial and lymphoid origins and express a limited set of latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such gene, ORF73, encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), a multifunctional protein that plays roles in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication, episome maintenance, and transcriptional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LANA interacts with cellular proteins involved in transcriptional regulation such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> (Rb) and p53, and RING3 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although several reports about specific LANA-regulated promoters exist, only limited data are available that address how LANA expression in KSHV-infected cells globally affects cellular gene expression, thereby potentially contributing to KSHV pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate this question, we generated an Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line that expresses LANA from a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-inducible promoter (BJAB/Tet-On/LANA), and we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling at different time points post-induction revealed that 186 genes were activated or repressed over 2-fold in the presence of LANA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these genes, 41 are regulated in the Rb/E2F pathway, whereas 7 are related to p53 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether these gene expression changes translate into LANA-dependent changes in cell cycle regulation, we overexpressed p16 INK4a, a CDK4/6 inhibitor that efficiently induces cell cycle arrest in Rb-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, LANA expression protects lymphoid cells from p16 INK4a-induced cell cycle arrest and induces S-phase entry </plain></SENT>
