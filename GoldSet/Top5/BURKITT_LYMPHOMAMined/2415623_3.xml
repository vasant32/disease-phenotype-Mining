<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of CALLA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in the cell populations was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence measured by using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average number of CALLA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> per cell were measured by two assays: in a direct assay by binding 125I-labeled antibody J5 to cells, and indirectly by binding 125I-labeled protein A from Staphylococcus aureus to J5-coated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On average, CW678, Namalwa, and Nalm-6 cells bore about 1 X 10(4), 6 X 10(4), and 8 X 10(4) CALLA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> per cell respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histograms of the absolute number of CALLA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed by individual cells in the populations of CW678, Namalwa, and Nalm-6 cultures were generated by a combined analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the binding data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first example of histograms showing quantitative distribution of antigen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previously, the expression of antigens by individual cells as obtained by flow cytometry was only presented in terms of relative fluorescence intensity of individual cells in cell populations </plain></SENT>
