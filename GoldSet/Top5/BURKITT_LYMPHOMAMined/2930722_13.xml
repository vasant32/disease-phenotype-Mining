<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 11 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, 11 had <z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp>, and 15 patients had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disease, of whom 10 had mental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> was found in 13 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 17 and the median white cell count was 25.5 x 10(9)/I (range 8.6-89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface immunoglobulins were found on the blasts of every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had a t(8;14) (q24;q32) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One had an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, but only six mitoses could be examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the period of the study different treatment protocols, which comprised increasingly intensive systemic and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> chemotherapy, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients died less than 3 weeks after admission, two of them of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e> and two of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two other patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> was seen in spite of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (56%) achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two were allografted and two were autografted early in CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients relapsed, three of the four relapses involving the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A median actuarial disease-free survival was not attained, and a plateau was achieved at 57% after 7 months, with no later relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median actuarial survival of the 18 patients was only 6 months, but a plateau was obtained at 31% after 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prognosis seemed related to the intensity of chemotherapy: recent patients, treated more aggressively, achieved CR more often than earlier patients, treated with less intensive protocols, although the number of patients was too small to draw any firm conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The initial white cell count was also a prognostic factor, as none of the patients with more than 30 x 10(9)/I leucocytes achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the outcome of adult L3 ALL can be improved, as in children, by increased intensity of treatment, particularly with regard to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are still frequent, however, but their incidence can probably be reduced by better prevention and early management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumour lysis syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
