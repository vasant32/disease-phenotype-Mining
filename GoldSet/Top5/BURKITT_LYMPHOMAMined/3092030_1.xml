<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of chain association in the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of HLA-A and -B antigens was investigated by injecting these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species into Xenopus laevis oocytes and following the fates of the translated products by immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding beta 2-microglobulin from the B lymphoblastoid cell line MST was coinjected with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding the HLA-A and -B antigen heavy chains from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi, fully assembled class I antigens were detected using the monoclonal antibody W6/32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result suggested that there may be no defect in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding Daudi HLA-A and -B antigen heavy chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the state of maturity of the N-linked glycan units on these class I antigen heavy chains was assessed, they were found to have undergone some processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding immunoglobulin M (IgM) was injected into oocytes, the glycan units of the IgM heavy chains were found to be in the unprocessed (high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>) form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result shows that Xenopus oocytes can process some eukaryotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> of exogenous origin </plain></SENT>
