<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of the use of a cell block preparation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (EB-3) as a positive control for in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) for EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: EB-3 cells were processed into cell block and cytocentrifuge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> for EBER was performed, and the results were compared with a commercially available EBV positive control slide (cytocentrifuge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cost of preparing the cell block and cytocentrifuge sample was only a fraction of the price of commercial control slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> for EBER was strongly stained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparations with similar intensity of staining but with a much higher number of positive cells in the cell block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the cellular details in the cell block were considerably inferior to those on the cytocentrifuge and commercial control slide, with distortion of nuclei and smudging of chromatin, the interpretation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> results was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell block was stable at room temperature when examined after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cell block preparation of an EBV-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line serves as a reliable, stable and a relatively inexpensive control, with good preservation of cellular details of cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> study for EBER in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
