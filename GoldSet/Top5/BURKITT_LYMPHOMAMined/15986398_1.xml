<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> require correlation of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular-cytogenetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy (FNAB) is a valuable diagnostic technique that allows material to be collected for these ancillary studies, and for morphologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report a series of seven cases clinically or morphologically suspicious for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies (FISH) for c-myc were performed on FNAB material and correlated with cytologic and immunophenotypic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of seven specimens were positive for c-myc rearrangement by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, only three of these cases represented Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with one additional case of atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other cases included diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, monomorphic posttransplant B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and an aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, with the latter case negative for c-myc rearrangement by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 2 non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> specimens tested, 1 was positive for the immunoglobulin H/bcl-2 rearrangement, in addition to the c-myc rearrangement, suggesting transformation from a lower grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrated the value of FNAB in the diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as well as the importance of obtaining material for, and integrating results of, ancillary studies for the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
