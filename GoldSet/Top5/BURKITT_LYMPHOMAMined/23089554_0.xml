<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the modulator activity of the potent herbal extract drug thymoquinone on EBV was assessed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thymoquinone was tested for cytotoxicity on human cells of lymphoblastoid cells, Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, DG-75 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and periodontal ligament fibroblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induction was analyzed via TUNEL assay and activity studies of caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of thymoquinone on EBV gene expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report here, for the first time, a promising selective inhibitory affect of thymoquinone on EBV-infected B cell lines in vitro, compared with lower activity on EBV negative B cell line and very low toxicity on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and periodontal ligament fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the drug was found to efficiently suppress the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> expression of EBNA2, LMP1, and EBNA1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, EBNA2 expression levels were the most affected indicating that this gene might have a major contribution to thymoquinone potency against EBV infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results suggest that thymoquinone has the potential to suppress the growth of EBV-infected B cells efficiently </plain></SENT>
