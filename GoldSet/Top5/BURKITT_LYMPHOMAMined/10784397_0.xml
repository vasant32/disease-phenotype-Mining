<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The LMB protocol is an intensive chemotherapy regimen which yields high survival rates in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) in children, as well as in primary cerebral DLCL (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>) of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the long term results of this regimen in a prospective series of 22 adult patients with DLCL excluding <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen male and 7 female patients with a median age of 30 years (range: 20-55) were treated prospectively between 1988 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>16 (72%) patients had an age adjusted International Pronostic Index (IPI) &gt; or = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the treatment was 15 weeks (range 13-19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 22 patients (87%) experienced an objective response (14 complete, and 5 partial responses) at the end of the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predominant toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>: 89% of the COPADEM courses were followed by grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and 5% with grade IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died (4%) of treatment related toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 94 months and a minimum follow-up of 65 months, 8-year overall and progression-free survival are 73% and 67% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 8 year overall survival were 100%, 78% and 42% in patients with an IPI 0, 1, and 2-3 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This short intensive regimen yields promising long term survival rates in this monocentric prospective study and may deserve to be tested in a larger multicentric prospective study comparing it to the CHOP regimen </plain></SENT>
