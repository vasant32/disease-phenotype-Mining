<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We showed previously that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency is disrupted and the virus-replicative cycle is activated after expression of EBNA2 in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, an EBNA2 deletion mutant lacking the amino acid residues 248-382, including the region responsible for association with RBP-J kappa, was generated and tested for its ability to activate EBV replication in Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutant was shown clearly deficient in inducing the EBV-replicative cycle, suggesting that association with RBP-J kappa is necessary for the EBV activating function of EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is thus likely that EBV activation by EBNA2, seemingly in conflict with its involvement in lymphocyte immortalization, is nevertheless based on the standard mechanism of transactivation by the protein </plain></SENT>
