<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In those diseases, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) is constitutively expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we reported an innovative system to detect active EBNA-1 protein in a homogeneous assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system is based on the modulation of thrombin activity by a self-complementary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single stranded DNA</z:chebi> (scssDNA), which was designed and synthesized to mimic the palindromic target sites of EBNA-1 in the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model system showed a limit of detection of 3.75 ng mL(-1) of active EBNA-1 protein with a dynamic detection range from 3.75 to 250 ng mL(-1) with a correlation coefficient of 0.997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This new homogeneous assay for active EBNA-1 protein detection and quantification provides a very useful tool for rapid screening of EBNA-1 blockers in biomedical research </plain></SENT>
