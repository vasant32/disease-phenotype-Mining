<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLDs</z:e> are of B-cell origin and frequently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the setting of pharmacological immunosuppression posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monomorphic PTLDs</z:e> commonly resemble diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>-like PTLDs are very rare </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The liver biopsy revealed marked infiltration of atypical plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction and positivity for EBV by in situ hybridization confirming the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also noted was a remarkable increase of tissue eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of immunosuppression led to improvement in his clinical condition, and also resolution of the hepatic lesions and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> noted on imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While a few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>-like PTLDs have been described in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>-like PTLD in a liver transplant recipient occurring in the allograft with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> having distinct histopathologic features including tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
