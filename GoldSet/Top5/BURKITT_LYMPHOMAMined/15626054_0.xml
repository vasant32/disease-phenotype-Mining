<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients with non-Hodgkin's Iymphoma </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Patients aged 13 years and above, with non-Hodgkin's Iymphomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case records were available for 207 patients, 146 males and 60 females, with one having had gender not clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty two per cent of the patients were aged less than 40 years and 18.4% over 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty one per cent were not properly classified histologically, seventy patients out of 190 evaluable (36.8%) had stages <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> disease at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty five out of 77(32.5%) tested positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, none of them being of the indolent variety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up to 57.1% of cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tested positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, (CHOP) chemotherapy was given to 68.7% of the patients with complete remission rates of 55.6% for those who got a minimum of six courses of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 15.3% of 105 patients evaluable were followed up for 36 months and above, the majority of patients having been lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Poor performance status at diagnosis correlated with shorter follow-up durations (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A good percentage of the patients were not comprehensively characterized pathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment was offered to the majority of patients, and those who could afford to purchase the medicines stood good chance of achieving complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Poor performance status at diagnosis correlated with shorter follow-up durations and early stage disease correlated with longer follow-up durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall, the outlook for NHLs treated at KNH in the 1990s appears to have improved tremendously </plain></SENT>
