<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By direct analysis of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> constituents of leukemic cells, we have previously detected several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> that are restricted in their expression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide evidence that two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> designated L2 and L4 are structurally related and represent novel markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Partial amino acid sequence analysis did not uncover differences between L2 and L4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sequences obtained correspond to a previously cloned human gene designated hsp 27 that is expressed, following heat shock treatment, in a variety of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>32Pi incorporation studies indicate that L4 is an unphosphorylated form and L2 is a phosphorylated form of hsp27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two forms were inducible by heat shock in leukemic and nonleukemic lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> subtype is uniquely characterized by the constitutive expression of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that represents a major cellular phosphoprotein </plain></SENT>
