<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some long-established lines such as RPMI 1788, CESS and recently established early-passage Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid lines were constitutive IL 6 producers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other long-established lymphoblastoid lines such as RPMI 8866 and SKW6.4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines tested were nonproducers of IL 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constitutive production of IL 6 in early passage lines could be enhanced by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and recombinant (r)IL 4 but not by rIL 1 alpha or rIL 1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonproducing EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines could be induced to IL 6 production by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, rIL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta and IL 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the nonproducing lines SKW6.4 was induced to IL 6 production by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, rIL 1 alpha, rIL 1 beta and rIL 4, whereas RPMI 8866 was induced only by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, to a limited extent by rIL 1 alpha and rIL 1 beta but not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> by rIL 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no induction of IL 6 by any recombinant cytokine in the two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines but measurable production of IL 6 was induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> in one of them (EB4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokines which were neither enhancers nor inducers of cell lines on their own included rIL 2, rIL 5, interferon (rIFN)-gamma, native purified IFN-alpha, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (rTNF)-alpha, rTNF-beta and purified platelet-derived transforming growth factor-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rIL 4 synergized with either rIL 1 alpha or rIL 1 beta in the induction of IL 6 in the nonproducing line SKW6.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar effects were also seen in this line with combinations of (a) rIFN-gamma and rIL 4 and (b) IFN-alpha and both rIL 1 alpha and rIL 1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>rIL 4, with or without rIL 1, was more effective than rIL 6 in the induction of IgM synthesis in SKW6.4 and the effect was only partially inhibited by anti-IL 6 antiserum at a dose which totally inhibited IL 6-induced IgM production </plain></SENT>
