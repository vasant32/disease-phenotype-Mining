<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory has found that BZLF1 (Z) localizes to host chromosomes during mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two Z-interacting proteins are also found localized to mitotic chromosomes in the presence of Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between Z and mitotic chromosomes may lead to the sequestering of Z-interacting proteins within the cell and potentially cause an alteration of chromosome compaction or chromatin structure </plain></SENT>
