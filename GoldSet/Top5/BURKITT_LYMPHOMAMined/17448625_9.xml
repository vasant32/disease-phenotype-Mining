<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to examine its anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect on other malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells of the following lines were incubated with 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0microM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi>: human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (HuCC), B <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (EHEB), human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> (K562) and Raji, a prototype of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> exerted a significant dose-dependent effect on the proliferation capacity of K562, Raji and HuCC lines, whereas this effect was observed in EHEB cells only with the highest dose used in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased apoptotic rate was found after incubation of HuCC cells with 2.0 and 4.0microM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> and in Raji cells following incubation with 2.0microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings point out that the anti-proliferative effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15948">lycopene</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and its effect on the apoptotic rate depends on its dosage and on the type of the malignant cells </plain></SENT>
