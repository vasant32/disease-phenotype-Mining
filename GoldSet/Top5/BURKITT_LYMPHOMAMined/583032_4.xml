<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From the therapuetic point of view, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> can be classified into two groups: favourable prognosis histology (DWDL, NWDL, NPDL, and NM) and unfavourable prognosis histology (DPDL, DM, DH, NH, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter group also includes lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T cell) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further classification by immunological markers (T, B, monocyte, null cell) and functional categories (T-cell subsets) may reveal prognostic groups which require separate consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intensive chemotherapy of unfavourable histoligies can result in long-term disease-free survival as reported in several series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It would appear that the 10 year survival rates will not differ greatly between several multi-drug regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the present time, the histopathological subtype permits selection of patients for a trial of intensive chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progress in the future will be made with improved techniques for the management of bulky abdominal disease and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the above may result in some statistical improvement in survival of the unfavourable group, the vast majority of patients with favourable histology <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> require new approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These may take the form of treatment with immunological manoeuvres such as idiotypic-specific antibodies and/or the use of intensive chemotherapy, especially when there is convincing evidence of a change in the biology of the disease </plain></SENT>
