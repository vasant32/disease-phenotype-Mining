<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis has found strong support in the recent findings that some cellular homologues of retroviral onc genes are located in chromosomal segments which are affected by specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-related abnormalities (see ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4 for review) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of human undifferentiated B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (UBL) and mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo>, cytogenetic and chromosomal mapping data have identified characteristic chromosomal recombinations directly involving different immunoglobulin genes and the c-myc oncogene (for review see refs 5, 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UBLs carrying the t(8:14) translocation it has been shown that the human c-myc gene is located on the region of chromosome 8 (8q24) which is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IHC) on chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it is known that the chromosomal breakpoints can be variably located within or outside the c-myc locus and within the IHC mu (refs 9, 11) or IHC gamma locus, the recombination sites have not been exactly identified and mapped in relation to the functional domains of these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report here the identification and characterization of two reciprocal recombination sites between c-myc and IHC mu in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequencing of the cross-over point joining chromosomes 8 and 14 on chromosome 14q--shows that the onc gene is interrupted within its first intron and joined to the heavy-chain mu switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This recombination predicts that the translocated onc gene would code for a rearranged <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> c-myc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
