<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence are compatible with the hypothesis that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) or leader protein (EBNA-LP) affects expression of the EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> membrane protein LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now demonstrate the following </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(i) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> transfection and expression of EBNA-2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus promoters resulted in increased LMP1 expression in P3HR-1-infected Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and the P3HR-1 or Daudi cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(ii) Transfection and expression of EBNA-LP alone had no effect on LMP1 expression and did not act synergistically with EBNA-2 to affect LMP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(iii) LMP1 expression in Daudi and P3HR-1-infected cells was controlled at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level, and EBNA-2 expression in Daudi cells increased LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(iv) No other EBV genes were required for EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 since cotransfection of recombinant EBNA-2 expression vectors and genomic LMP1 DNA fragments enhanced LMP1 expression in the EBV-negative B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines BJAB, Louckes, and BL30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(v) An EBNA-2-responsive element was found within the -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA since this DNA linked to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an EBNA-2 expression vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(vi) The EBV type 2 EBNA-2 transactivated LMP1 as well as the EBV type 1 EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(vii) Two deletions within the EBNA-2 gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did not transactivate LMP1, whereas a transformation-competent EBNA-2 deletion mutant did transactivate LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMP1 is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with EBNA-2 to induce cellular CD23 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 amplifies the biological impact of EBNA-2 and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation </plain></SENT>
