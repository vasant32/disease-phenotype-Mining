<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 induces transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is expressed at high levels in NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EGFR transcription is induced by LMP1 through a p50 NFκB1-Bcl-3 complex, and Bcl-3 is induced by LMP1-mediated activation of STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study reveals that LMP1, through its carboxyl-terminal activation domain 1 (LMP1-CTAR1), activates both STAT3 and EGFR in a serum-independent manner with constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon treatment with EGF, the LMP1-CTAR1-induced EGFR was additionally phosphorylated and STAT3 became phosphorylated on tyrosine, concomitant with upregulation of a subset of STAT3 target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinase responsible for LMP1-CTAR1-mediated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was identified to be PKCδ using specific RNAi, a dominant negative PKCδ, and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, inhibition of PKCδ also inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and LMP1-CTAR1-induced phosphorylation of ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PKCδ blocked LMP1-CTAR1-mediated transformation of Rat-1 cells, likely through the inhibition of ERK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that LMP1 activates multiple distinct signaling pathways and suggest that PKCδ functions as a master regulator of EGFR, STAT3, and ERK activation by LMP1-CTAR1 </plain></SENT>
