<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spi-B is an Ets transcription factor related to the oncoprotein Spi-1/PU.1 and highly expressed in B lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Ets proteins share a conserved Ets domain that mediates specific DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spi-B binds DNA sequences containing a core 5'-GGAA-3' and activates transcription through this motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up to date, the biological function of Spi-B remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of Spi-B, named deltaSpi-B, which has lost the Ets domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In B lymphoid cells, deltaspi-B and spi-B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were present simultaneously in a ratio of around 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DeltaSpi-B product was not able to bind DNA and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We raise the hypothesis that delta Spi-B might affect Spi-B function by recruiting factors involved in Spi-B activity </plain></SENT>
