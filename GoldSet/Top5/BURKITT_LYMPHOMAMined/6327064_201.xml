<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A chromosomal myc gene displays one of three patterns of activity depending upon the arrangement of the gene and its allelic partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nonmalignant B cells both myc alleles are normally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells carrying both a translocated and a nontranslocated myc allele, the translocated allele is inappropriately expressed, while the nontranslocated allele is virtually inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the chromatin structure of these genes using DNAase I hypersensitivity in nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cells and in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, BL31  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hypersensitivity patterns emerge that correlate with the state of the gene and reveal sites associated with putative regulatory structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One region is associated with the two myc promoters, one with a specific nuclear protein binding site, and one--which is markedly enhanced in the inactive germline gene in the Burkitt cell--with a putative negative control region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perturbation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern in this particular Burkitt cell may be due to the action of an immunoglobulin enhancer </plain></SENT>
