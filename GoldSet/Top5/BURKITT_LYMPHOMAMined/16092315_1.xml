<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent times more of these cases are being seen presenting first to the Ear Nose and Throat clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to look at the pattern of presentation of head and Neck Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at a Nigerian Tertiary hospital and to evaluate current treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: It is a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confirmed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the head and neck region seen at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Ile Ife (OAUTHC) between 1986 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with the histopathologically confirmed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> over a 17-year period (1986-2002) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> affecting the Head and neck region were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data extracted were entered into a questionnaire and analysis of data was done using the SPSS 10.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 196 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were seen over the period out of which 140 (71.4%) were in the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a male preponderance with the incidence of 72% and 28% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peak age incidence was found to be within the first decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common sites that were affected are; the jaw (65.9%), nasal and paranasal sinuses (12.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Majority of the patients presented with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combination Chemotherapy comprising <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, Oncovin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi> (COMP) was the mainstay of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The treatment outcome was only favorable in 36.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Default rate was (11.7%) while the mortality rate was (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Relapse\recurrence was found in (5.1%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Frank drug resistance was found in (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>Blindness</z:hpo> was found to be a major morbidity associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>Septicemia</z:mpath> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were found to be the major causes of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Some complications of treatment were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The importance of the findings in this work was discussed in line with the existing literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Head and neck remain the mostly affected parts in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Presentation with advanced disease is the bane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This partly explains high morbidity and mortality in affected children </plain></SENT>
