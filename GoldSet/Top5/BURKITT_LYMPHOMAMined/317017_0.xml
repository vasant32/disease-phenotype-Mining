<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact role of adjuvant chemotherapy is not settled, but there are certain groups of high-risk patients who should receive chemotherapy, such as those with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal disease</z:e> or advanced IIIA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the advanced stages, chemotherapy assumes the primary role and with the MOPP programme (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925">chlormethine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>), alone or alternating with ABVD (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, vinblastine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>), a substantial number of patients can be controlled or cured.The therapeutic approach to non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be guided mainly by the histological findings, favourable or unfavourable, and to a lesser degree also by the stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, chemotherapy rather than radiotherapy is the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the favourable histology group, a conservative approach is usually justified in the majority of patients, while in the unfavourable histology group, aggressive combination chemotherapy containing adriamycin is the recommended therapy.In underprivileged populations, the abdominal and intestinal localization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> is more common than in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of special interest are Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in their varying aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both diseases, the importance of environmental factors is highly suggestive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Referral of such patients to centres involved in the management of these diseases is essential </plain></SENT>
