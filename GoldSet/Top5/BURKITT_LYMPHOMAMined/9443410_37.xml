<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach will undoubtedly be influenced by the ability of these malignant cells to endogenously process and present target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on their cell surface for immune recognition by CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of NPC cells in fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies and long-term, established NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of the MHC-encoded putative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transporters TAP1 and TAP2, as well as the proteasome components LMP2 and LMP7, which have been shown previously to be essential components of the class I processing pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells also showed high levels of HLA class I alleles on the cell surface, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> are available for binding to nascent MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042214" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vaccinia</z:e> virus to transiently express the EBV nuclear antigens, we studied the antigen-processing efficiency of NPC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that, in contrast to cells from another EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, NPC cells display <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antigen-processing function and are efficiently recognized by HLA class I-restricted, virus-specific CTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies also provide a rationale for focusing on strategies designed to activate CTLs specific for EBV antigens that are expressed in NPC cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
