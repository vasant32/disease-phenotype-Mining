<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> inhibits prolactin release from pituitary cells and seems to affect the release of several other hormones as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> may have similar effects on human B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells leading to inhibition of production or release of endogenous factors required for cell viability and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, addition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> to serum-free cultures of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji, Namalwa, Daudi and Jijoye) resulted in rapid and extensive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while a <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line, SKO, appeared to be refractory to this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of FCS or supernatant from serum-free cultures of Raji or T24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo> cells could, to a variable degree, counteract the effect of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> acts by inhibiting the production of essential autocrine factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When two of the hormones known to be under <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> control, i.e. prolactin (PRL) and thyrotropin (TSH), were tested, they were able to prevent <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> if combined with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further observed that the reducing agent 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> (2-ME), which is known to inhibit the binding of TSH to its receptor, displayed similar effects to those of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and was strongly inhibitory for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not for <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As expected from its blocking activity at the receptor level, the effect of 2-ME could not be reversed by adding exogenous factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to its effect on B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, 2-ME is essential for growth of the murine T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line CTLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we show here that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> can fully compensate for 2-ME, suggesting that TSH or another factor under <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> control is intimately involved in the regulation of T-cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study lends further support to the notion of an active interplay between the neuroendocrine and immune systems and emphasizes PRL and TSH as important regulators of lymphoid cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also shows that these hormones may contribute to the autonomous growth pattern of B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and suggests a potential role for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> in the treatment of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
