<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ikaros is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effects result in part from the balance between the isoforms that are produced by differential splicing of the pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short isoforms that lack the DNA-binding domain act as dominant negatives by binding long isoforms through the C-terminal zinc-finger domain, which allows for the homo- or heterodimerization of the proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are a number of evidences that different subsets of murine hematopoietic progenitors - as defined by phenotype - have different patterns of Ikaros expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of short isoforms (Ik5, Ik6 or Ik7) in murine or human hematopoietic progenitors alters the differentiation capacities of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> provide additional information: because of the blockade in differentiation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> represent an equivalent of a particular stage of human hematopoietic hierarchy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We and others have shown that human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> for the pattern of Ikaros isoform expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study focused on adult de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B ALLs</z:e> and the Ikaros 6 isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ProB (BI, n=3), common B (BII, n=15) and preB (BIII, n=3) ALL were identified by their phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and Western blot analyses of blast cell protein lysates suggest that approximately 50% of BII <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> overexpress Ikaros 6 RNA and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of BII cells with high or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of Ik6 shows a higher level of expression for the membrane stem cell antigen CD34 in the former, as detected with flow cytometry and confirmed with DNA arrays </plain></SENT>
