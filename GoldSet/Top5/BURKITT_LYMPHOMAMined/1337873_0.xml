<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The process involved the use of the PCR technique to amplify the target gene and to generate the radiolabelled products which was used as a probe to hybridize the target gene in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ki-ras oncogene in human pancreatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line (PC-2) and EBV DNA in Raji cell line were detected in situ by this technique with encouraging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique has the advantages of both PCR and in situ hybridization, i.e., high sensitivity, quick amplification and precise localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is a rapid, simple, economical and reliable method </plain></SENT>
