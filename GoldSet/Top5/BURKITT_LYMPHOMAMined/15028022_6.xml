<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes play a major role in signal transduction and contribute to the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about subtype-specific intracellular expression of PKC in human malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the relationship between expression of PKC and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> based on the different subspecies, we investigated the expression of four subspecies (alpha, beta II, gamma and delta) in five cases of reactive lymphoid tissues, 77 cases of human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 17 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the reactive lymphoid tissues, PKC beta II-positive cells were found in the mantle zones and marginal zones, and centroblasts and centrocytes in the germinal centers showed cytoplasmic staining with strong intensity against PKC delta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first report to examine the expression of PKC delta in reactive lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In interfollicular areas, a small number of T-cells were positive for PKC alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C gamma-positive cells were not found in these lymphoid tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) (8/10; 80%) showed the overexpression of PKC alpha (P &lt; 0.01), but other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases except three cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not express PKC alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, six and eight out of nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines expressed the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of PKC alpha, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that PKC alpha was predominantly expressed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in comparison with other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of PKC gamma was observed in only five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of PKC gamma-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was significantly better than that of PKC gamma-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of PKC gamma seems to be associated with a better prognosis in the limited number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases in the present study </plain></SENT>
