<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these children 96, 11, and 28 suffered from B-progenitor, mature B cell, and T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients initial central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement was documented by the presence of lymphoblasts with high CSF cell counts (B+C+ patients); 19 patients had CSF lymphoblasts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF cell counts (B+C- patients); the others had no CSF blasts and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF cell counts (B-C- patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In B+C- and B-C- patients 5-year-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-free survival was 66 and 70%, respectively (i.e., not significantly different) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the B+C- patients experienced a first relapse in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in outcome by comparing with reports of others may be related to the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our patients </plain></SENT>
