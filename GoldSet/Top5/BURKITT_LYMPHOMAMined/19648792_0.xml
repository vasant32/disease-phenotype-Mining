<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The majority of the patients was male (63/88, 72%), with a median age of 8.9 years (range, 2.5 to 20 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ethnic origin was Jewish in 73% (64/88), and Arabic in 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty (57%) patients were classified as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 5 (5.7%) as Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 22 (25%) as diffuse large B cell (DLBC), and 9 (10.2%) as Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with over 25% of their bone marrow (BM) involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial disease sites included the abdomen in 43%, head and neck in 45%, and mediastinum in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stage I: 9.1%; stage II: 28.4%; stage III: 45.5%, stage IV: 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had BM involvement alone, 5 patients had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement alone, and 4 had both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The children were divided into 3 groups according to risk factors, with 5 in group A, 69 in group B, and 14 in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3 years (12 mo to 7.6 y), the Kaplan-Meier for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) according to whole group treatment was 88.6% and 90.9%, group A was 100% and 100%; group B was 89.9% and 92.8%; and group C was 78.6% and 78.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no untoward events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in group A, whereas 6 patients relapsed in group B, 4 of whom died (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relapsed during the first year), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> in 3 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of toxicity in 1 patient who had multiorgan failure 2 days after initiation of COP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients in group C relapsed and died (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients relapsed during the first 6 months), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tumor lysis syndrome</z:e> in 4 patients but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EFS for LDH less than twice was 96.4%, EFS for LDH more than twice was 73.3% (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OS according to primary site: bone and ovary: 100%; head and neck: 95%; abdomen: 92%; mediastinum: 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference between the mediastinal primary site to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other primary sites was statistically significant with P=0.003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumors</z:e> were of DLBC origin but no significant differences in outcome were found when DLBC was compared with other histologies (DLBC: 81.8%, other B line: 90.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>OS for patients of Arabic ethnic origin was 79.2%, for Jewish patients was 95.3%, P=0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We could not determine any prognostic factors that were different between the groups, which raises the question of a genetic influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In nonresected mature B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of childhood and adolescence with no BM or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, a 93% cure rate can be achieved, similar to the French-American-British/LMB 96 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients with primary DLBC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> had a significantly reduced OS, indicating the need for a different therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
