<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter were studied by the blocking of direct membrane staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-conjugated Mutua serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This serum has been derived from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patient in long-term regression after chemotherapy and is free from detectable isoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been used previously as a standard of reference to demonstrate the presence of the membrane antigen(s) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lines derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsies and leukocytes from IM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that 102 of 279 (37%) of the sera tested had high anti-EBV titers (&gt;==80) and high membrane-blocking (Bl &gt; 0.5) activity, 124 of 279 (44%) of the sera were low in both tests, 22 of 279 (8%) had low EBV titers (&lt;==80), in spite of a high blocking index, and 31 of 279 (11%) of the sera were low in blocking activity (&lt;0.5), in spite of a high EBV titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two tests thus gave concordant results with 81% and discordant with 19% of the sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> patients were high in both tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IM sera also showed a relationship between the two antibody activities but, in general, both activities were lower than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ca PNS sera seemed to fall into two main groups: (a) high anti-EBV, high blocking or (b) low anti-EBV, low blocking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Control sera, including four isoantisera, showed predominantly low reactivities in both tests </plain></SENT>
