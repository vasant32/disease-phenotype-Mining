<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A need to ascertain the role of surgery in the treatment of this illness prompted this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of nine children 5 to 12 years of age with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, eight had abdominal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the eight patients also had oral lesions and staging was done by biopsy of the oral lesion and noninvasive imaging of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other six patients presented with abdominal complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these had diagnostic paracentesis, another had only gastroscopy, and four underwent exploratory laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four children in whom the diagnosis was established either by biopsy of an oral lesion, biopsy of an abdominal mass, or resection of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000735" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">abdominal tumor</z:e> are alive without evidence of disease 6 months to 6 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each of these children had rapid initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the other four who died, two had delayed induction of drug therapy following cytoreduction or gastroscopic biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best outcomes were associated with prompt chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that except in rare instances in which a solitary lesion lends itself to total or near-total resection, the proper role of surgery is a simple, safe procedure to obtain enough viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> for accurate diagnosis and prompt chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
