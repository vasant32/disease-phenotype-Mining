<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we focus on the immunomodulatory function of an anti-CD3/CA19-9 bi-MoAb in combination with a costimulatory anti-CD28 antibody which may result not only in antigen-specific, T cell-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cell lysis but also in recruitment of other cellular effector functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In combination with costimulatory anti-CD28 antibodies, resting peripheral lymphocytes could be activated specifically to secrete high amounts of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)) characterizing a cellular immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no IL-4 and only low amounts of IL-10 could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bi-MoAb-mediated CA19-9-specific activation of T cells was accompanied by recruitment of MHC- and CA19-9-independent cytotoxicity, as was determined by lysis of different CA19-9-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This MHC-independent cytotxicity was mediated at least in part by activated natural killer (NK) cells, as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD16+ NK cells resulted in substantial decrease of cytotoxicity against CA19-9- targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that specific activation of resting T cells with CD3-associated bi-MoAbs in combination with an anti-CD28 antibody leads to a Th1 differentiation pathway and is accompanied by recruitment of MHC-independent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity which can possibly be directed against a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
