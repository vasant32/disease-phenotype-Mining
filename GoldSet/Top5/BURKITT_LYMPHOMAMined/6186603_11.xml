<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report concerns the effect of interferons on the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line Daudi, which does not express HLA-A, B, C antigens or beta 2-microglobulin on its membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-A, B, C <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> present in Daudi cells is increased by both alpha and beta interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have shown that although it was not possible to detect mature beta 2-microglobulin protein in the cytoplasm or on the cell membrane of Daudi cells, a poly A+ <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> is present in Daudi cells, which hybridizes with a cDNA clone specific for human beta 2-microglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This abnormal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> is, however, increased normally by interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects were also observed with human interferon beta on a variant of Daudi cells characterized by a markedly reduced sensitivity to anti-proliferative and anti-cellular effects of human interferon alpha </plain></SENT>
