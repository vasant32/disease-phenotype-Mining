<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fresh biopsy cells from cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) display a homogeneous cell surface phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells were found to be reactive with the pan B cell marker B1, and consistently co-expressed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen, BLA, and the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen, CALLA, but lacked the B cell "activation" antigens characteristically expressed on EB virus-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microscopic and cell sorter analysis of cells isolated from a series of fresh <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsils have identified a subpopulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells carrying the same cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>That BLA and CALLA could be co-expressed on individual B cells was demonstrated by two-color immunofluorescence (IF) of tonsils in suspension, and immunoperoxidase (IP) staining of serial tonsil sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These BLA+, CALLA+, "activation" antigen- cells were further characterized as B1+, sIgM+, sIgD-, C3d/EB virus receptor+ and were susceptible to virus-induced transformation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IF studies on Percoll-fractionated tonsillar cell populations and direct examination of IP-stained tonsil semi-thin sections indicated that the BLA+, CALLA+ cells were localized in germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their morphological characteristics matched those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, and their location within germinal centers was consistent both with the known phenotype of germinal center tonsillar B cells and with the description of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> as a proliferation of centroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this population of tonsillar germinal center B cells provides the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterpart of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
