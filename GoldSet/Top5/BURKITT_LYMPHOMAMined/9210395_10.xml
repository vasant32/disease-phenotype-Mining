<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The A-Myb transcription factor belongs to the Myb family of oncoproteins and is likely to be involved in the regulation of proliferation and/or differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize in detail the domains of A-Myb that regulate its function, we have generated a series of deletion mutants and have investigated their trans-activation potential as well as their DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results have allowed us to delineate the trans-activation domain as well as two separate regulatory regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The boundaries of the trans-activation domain (amino acid residues 218-319) are centred on a sequence rich in charged amino acids (residues 259-281) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region (residues 320-482) localized immediately downstream of the trans-activation domain and containing a newly identified conserved stretch of 48 residues markedly inhibits specific DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally the last 110 residues of A-Myb (residues 643-752), which include a sequence conserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammalian myb genes (region III), negatively regulate the maximal trans-activation potential of A-Myb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also investigated the functional interaction between A-Myb and the nuclear adaptor molecule CBP [cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that CBP synergizes with A-Myb in a dose-dependent fashion, and that this co-operative effect can be inhibited by E1A and can also be observed with the CBP homologue p300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that this functional synergism requires the presence of the A-Myb charged sequence and that it involves physical interaction between A-Myb and the CREB-binding domain of CBP </plain></SENT>
