<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparative analysis of three Epstein-Barr virus DNAs from American patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (B95-8, Cherry, and Lamont) and four Epstein-Barr virus DNAs from African patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (AG876, W91, Raji, and P3HR-1) indicated that the usual format of Epstein-Barr virus DNA includes a variable number of direct repeats of a 0.35 X 10(6)-dalton sequence (TR) at both ends of the DNA, a 9 X 10(6)-dalton sequence of largely unique DNA (Us), a variable number of repeats of a 2 X 10(6)-dalton sequence (IR), and a 89 X 10(6)-dalton sequence of largely unique DNA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e> there was homology between DNA at 26 X 10(6) to 28 X 10(6) daltons and DNA at 93 X 10(6) to 95 X 10(6) daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative sequence order (TR, US, IR, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e>, TR) did not vary among "standard" Epstein-Barr virus DNA molecules of each isolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B95-8 DNA had an unusual deletion extending from 91 X 10(6) to 100 X 10(6) daltons, and P3HR-1 DNA had an unusual deletion extending from 23.5 X 10(6) to 26 X 10(6) daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was sufficient variability among the EcoRI and BamHI fragments of the DNAs to identify each isolate specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we discerned no distinguishing features for the two geographic or pathogenic origins of the seven isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three intracellular DNAs (Raji, Lamont, and Cherry) and one virion DNA (P3HR-1) were heterogenous in molecular organization and had subpopulations of rearranged or defective molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some regions, particularly 59 X 10(6) to 63 X 10(6) daltons and sequences around TR, frequently participated in rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restriction endonuclease maps of the standard and rearranged DNAs of the seven isolates are presented </plain></SENT>
