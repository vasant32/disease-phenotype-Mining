<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous B-lymphotropic herpesvirus associated with several <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, e.g., Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and is able to efficiently immortalize primary B lymphocytes in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth program of infected B cells is initiated and maintained by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), which regulates <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular genes, including the proto-oncogene c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, patterns of protein expression in B cells with and without EBNA2 were analyzed by two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used a conditional immortalization system for EBV, a B cell line (EREB2-5) that expresses an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor-EBNA2 fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to discriminate downstream targets of c-Myc from c-Myc-independent EBNA2 targets, we used an EREB2-5-derived cell line, P493-6, in which c-Myc is expressed under the control of a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulated promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 20 identified EBNA2 target proteins, 11 were c-Myc dependent and therefore most probably associated with proliferation, and one of these proteins was a posttranslationally modified protein, i.e., hypusinylated eIF5a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, to estimate the relevance of EBNA2 targets during early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, we analyzed the proteomes of primary B cells before and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein expression pattern induced upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was similar to that following EBNA2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings underscore the value of EREB2-5 cells as an appropriate model system for the analysis of early events in the process of EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization </plain></SENT>
