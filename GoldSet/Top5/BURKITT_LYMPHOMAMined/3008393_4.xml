<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TRI were also induced in Raji cells when grown in the medium of STA culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alpha-interferon (alpha IFN) was detected only in the medium of STA culture and not in PWM culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells of PWM cultures formed TRI when exposed to various concentrations of human leukocyte alpha IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidences of TRI-positive cells in the presence of 50-500 IU/ml of alpha IFN were 3-5% on day 2 and increased to 10% on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On days 5-7 of the PWM cultures, plasmacytoid cells containing TRI were seen not infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of a high concentration of alpha IFN (10,000 IU/ml), which was sufficient to inhibit cell growth and differentiation, the growth of the TRI region was not altered and the incidence of TRI-positive cells was 9% on day 2 and increased to 15% on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that the TRI formation in STA culture is attributable to the alpha IFN produced endogenously by STA-stimulated cells and that some relationship might exist between the incidences of TRI-positive cells in these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated cultures and the biologic functions of IFN </plain></SENT>
