<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of the conjugates has been compared with the ability of the antibodies to bind to target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity of the conjugates has been monitored following incorporation of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-leucine radioactivity into Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with surface Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 50% inhibition of protein synthesis is observed 18 h after treatment of cells with immunotoxins, when the concentration of the conjugates with poly- and monoclonal antibodies is 1.2.10(-9) M and 0.7.10(-9) M, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data take into account that only part of the polyclonal antibodies molecules is able to react with target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control conjugates containing either monoclonal antibodies that do not react with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells surface L-chains or nonimmune serum IgG proved to have no effect on target cells even at the level of 10(-7) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunotoxins with poly- and monoclonal antibodies produce almost the same kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition, when incubated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a 30 min treatment reveals a considerably higher cytotoxicity of the conjugate with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
