<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seven virus-coded proteins, the nuclear proteins EBNA-1 to EBNA-6 and the latent membrane protein (LMP), are regularly expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), only EBNA-1 is regularly expressed; LMP is detected in about 65% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> only EBNA-1 is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the methylation patterns of the EBV genome varied between these cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In virally transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin, the EBV DNA is completely unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line Rael and in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse-passaged NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, C15, there was an extensive methylation of CpG pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation extended into the coding regions of the two expressed genes, EBNA-1 (in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types) and LMP (in C15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two presumptive control regions were exempted from this overall methylation: the oriP that contains both an origin of DNA replication and an EBNA-1-dependent enhancer and the 5'-flanking region of the BNLF-1 open reading frame that codes for LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter was only exempted in the LMP expressing NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have now investigated the relation between expression of LMP and methylation of DNA in the 5'-flanking 1 kb region of BNLF-1, coding for LMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LMP was methylated in 3 of 12 NPC biopsies that did not express LMP but was partially or totally unmethylated in the remaining 9 that expressed the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three BNLF-1 exons were highly methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The oriP region was unmethylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, as in the previously studied Rael cell line and <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse-passaged NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, the BamHI W enhancer region involved in the expression of EBNA nuclear proteins was methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the biopsies expressed EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the EBV genomes are highly methylated in NPC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The strong reverse correlation between the methylation of the putative control region of the LMP gene and the expression of LMP suggests that methylation has a role in the regulation of this gene </plain></SENT>
