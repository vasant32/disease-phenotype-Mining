<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, published in 2000, was designed to improve diagnostic accuracy by incorporating the latest in scientific understanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of the WHO classification on the frequency of diagnostic discrepancy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> second-opinion pathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at our National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute-designated Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>) from January to June 2001 and from January to June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between submitted and second-opinion diagnoses were scored based upon an a priori grading schema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major diagnostic revision was rendered in 65 of 365 cases (17.8%) in 2001 and 58 of 354 (16.4%) in 2006 (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Including cases reviewed and revised beforehand at another NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi>, rates of major diagnostic revision were 21.4% and 18.6%, respectively (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discrepancy rates varied by diagnosis, from Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (10%) to Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was seen for age, gender, race/ethnicity, biopsy type, or nature of referring center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically meaningful diagnostic revision occurs frequently with expert pathology review for a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the WHO classification, rates of diagnostic revision at our institution in 2001 and 2006 did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the potential harm from misdiagnosis, expert hematopathology review should be considered the standard of care </plain></SENT>
