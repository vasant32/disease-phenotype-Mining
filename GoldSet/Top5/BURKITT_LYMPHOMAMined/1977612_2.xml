<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>13 cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) were studied combining cell surface marker analysis with immunogenotyping by Southern blot hybridisation with a panel of antigen receptor gene probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypes were unequivocal: 7 patients had B-phenotype and 6 patients T-phenotype ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In several patients immunogenotypes were not fully consistent with the respective phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, 2 B-cell precursor ALL had rearranged TCR beta chain genes and 2 T-ALL rearrangement of Ig heavy-chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed clonal rearrangement or deletions within the TCR delta gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCR delta gene rearrangements might, therefore, serve as markers of clonality but not of B- or T-lineage in immature lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in current diagnostic practice immunogenotyping is a supplement rather than an alternative to immunophenotyping by surface marker analysis </plain></SENT>
