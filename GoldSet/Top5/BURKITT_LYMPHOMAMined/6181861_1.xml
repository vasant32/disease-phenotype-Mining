<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The four-drug combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> produces a high response rate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have examined the cytokinetic effects of this drug combination in vitro and in human bone marrow in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in vitro analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> produces a concentration dependent slowing of S-phase transit with partial G2/M and G1/S blocks in cell cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A partially synchronized S-wave occurs 4-8 and 16-20 hours following a two-hour drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">Bleomycin</z:chebi> produces a dose dependent G2/M block during a 14-hour drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drug removal did not result in appreciable cell cycle synchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro exposure to the two drug combination resulted in loss of both the marked G2/M accumulation seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, and the partially synchronized S-phase waves seen following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sequential changes in bone marrow cytokinetics were determined in eight patients during and following administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> and a continuous four-day infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The major cytokinetic changes observed were an increase in G2/M phase cells 18 hours following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation and S-phase cells 24 and 48 hours following the end of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of 24 patients was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> 36 to 42 hours following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> had a subsequent median leukocyte nadir of 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> 60 to 72 hours after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> had median leukocyte nadir of 3.9 x 10(3)/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The objective response rates in the two groups was 75% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that bone marrow cytokinetic analysis may allow schedule modification to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> without loss of therapeutic activity </plain></SENT>
