<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition in vitro by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (DXM) and the expression of bcl-2 protein (Bcl-2) were investigated in Black93 and 17 other cell lines derived from EBV-negative or -positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL), and EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell origin (B-LCL), assuming an inherent susceptibility of Black93 to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive sensitivity to DXM and the lack of Bcl-2 expression observed in Black93 are a major characteristic exhibited frequently by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and, probably, by fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
