<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples of 16 patients (two adults and 14 children) with a B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), and in whom Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were detectable at diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were studied during evolution using PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VDJ junctional fragment of the Ig heavy chain rearranged gene was amplified at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After length reduction by restriction digestion, the amplified fragment was recovered by chromatography, labelled using a specific hexamer as a primer and directly used as a clonospecific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the PCR ranged from 1:10(4) to 1:10(5) cells, depending on the patient's rearrangement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in patients remaining in complete remission, the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> showed a tendency to decrease and ultimately become undetectable for variable periods of time, while in patients eventually relapsing there was a trend for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> to persist at stable levels and even to increase before relapse was clinically evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of a simplified methodology for obtaining a clonospecific probe from the Ig heavy chain gene, though less sensitive than the sequencing methodology, is a valuable and readily available tool to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> in a high proportion of B lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
