<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective case study from June 1997 through December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Seven provincial hospitals and Kenyatta National Referral Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Both sexes with tissue proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: By obtaining clinical information, and laboratory evaluatory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of vital statistics, anatomic site, stage and histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, vaccination, breastfeeding, congenital abnormality, parental vital statistics, education, smoking, water availability status and consanguinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty seven cases were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male to female (M:F) ratio was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean ages: patients 6.5, fathers 36.6, mothers 31.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologic types were: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) 45%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> 14%, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 9.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> 7.6%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> 5.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> 5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age distribution was as follows: 0-5 years, 46.5%, 6-10, 39.5% and 11-16 years 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The birth places of the children were as follows: Nyanza 25%, Central 21%, Eastern 16%, Western 13%, Rift Valley 9%, Coast 8%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Nairobi</z:e> 8% and North Eastern had less than one per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ethnic distribution was; Luo 25%, Kikuyu 22%, Luhya 13%, Kamba 10%, Coastal 6%, Kalenjin 6%, others 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifty per cent of the cases studied were breastfed for over six months, 34% for 3-6 months, five per cent less than three months and eleven per cent were not breastfed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eighty five per cent of the cases received complete vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The modal number of siblings was four and only 49% of parents received formal education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No consanguinity was noted in the studied population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The abdomen and jaw were main anatomic sites involved by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumour</z:e> is Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> is the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While the results demonstrate geographic and ethnic variations, other factors studied do not appear to influence the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the cases investigated </plain></SENT>
