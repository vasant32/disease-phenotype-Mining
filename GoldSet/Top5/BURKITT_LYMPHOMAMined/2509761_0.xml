<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), IgM-kappa, was detected in the serum by means of immunoelectrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypical analysis showed that the neoplastic cells were CD20+, OKIal+, CD10-, CD21-, surface Ig+ (M-kappa), and cytoplasmic Ig- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cells did not secret Ig by using of protein A plaque forming cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active transcription of Ig heavy chain genes was not detected by cell dot analysis of the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the possibility that the presence of the monoclonal Ig in the serum does not result from secretion of Ig from the neoplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The shedding of surface Ig from the neoplastic cells might result in the occurrence of monoclonal Ig in the serum </plain></SENT>
