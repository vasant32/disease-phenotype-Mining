<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Olomoucine is a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analog acting as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of olomoucine in gamma-irradiation mediated cell growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were studied in the Raji cell line (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gamma-irradiation caused a G2 arrest, increasing the G2/M fragment of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> by gamma-irradiation was apparent both by DNA-electrophoresis and PARP-1 cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of olomoucine with irradiation caused an increased G2 arrest and decreased cell survival and DNA synthesis in the non-apoptotic fraction of the remaining cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irradiation, as well as olomoucine and the combination of both, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems that olomoucine delays the apoptotic process and inhibits DNA fragmentation, but it decreased survival, cell cycle progression and proliferation of irradiated cells </plain></SENT>
