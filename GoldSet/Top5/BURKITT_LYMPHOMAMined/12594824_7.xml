<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Src homology 2 domain protein 1A (SH2D1A) is a small, 128-amino acid protein consisting of a single SH2 domain; it is probably involved in signal regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in activated T and natural killer (NK) cells, but not in B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was discovered in studies on the rare hereditary condition <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (XLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals with this condition either lack or carry an altered protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serious symptoms (fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mononucleosis</z:e>) present almost exclusively at the first encounter with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of SH2D1A in B cells, which are the targets of EBV, has to be reconciled with this clinical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an earlier search for B lymphocytes expressing SH2D1A, we detected it in EBV-carrying type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We now show SH2D1A in 5 EBV-negative classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>)-derived cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two lines belong to the T lineage and 3 to the B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One B-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> line, which originated from nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and differed in phenotype, was SH2D1A-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding is in accordance with the previously reported abundant SH2D1A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We thus found SH2D1A expression in lines of malignant origin assigned to the B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its presence in HRS cells may lead us closer to an understanding of the pathophysiology of the serious syndrome connected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in XLP patients, because HRS-like cells have been detected in the lymphoid tissue of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is likely therefore that in addition to the demonstrated functional defect of T and NK cells imposed by the SH2D1A mutation, the behavior of certain EBV-infected B lymphocytes is also modified </plain></SENT>
