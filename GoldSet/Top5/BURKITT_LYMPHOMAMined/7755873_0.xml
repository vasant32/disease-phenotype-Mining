<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>18 V-J junctional sequences (designated by N sequence) of TCR gamma gene were amplified with the V gamma and J gamma primers, using an unsymmetrical PCR and analysed by direct sequencing, demonstrating that in Chinese ALLs, the N sequences of TCR gamma gene are indeed clone-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the known N sequences, several oligo-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were synthesized as probes, which were specific for the leukemic clone, and were used to detect the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in 4 ALL cases </plain></SENT>
