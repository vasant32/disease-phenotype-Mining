<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study reports the production of clones of human killer T cells grown in the presence of TCGF4 following sensitization in MLC against (1) allogeneic cells, (2) autologous Bebv+ lymphocytes, or (3) autologous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitization against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells required the addition of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of the cytotoxic activity of the cloned T lymphocytes required re-stimulation with the specific stimulator cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxic activity seemed to be MHC-restricted, since (1) cloned allosensitized CTL lysed their corresponding allogeneic targets, but did not lyse autologous Bebv+ cell or K562 cells; (2) cloned CTL sensitized against autologous Bebv+ cells lysed their autologous targets but not allogeneic Bebv+ targets or K562 cells; and (3) cloned CTL sensitized against autologous Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells lysed their corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> targets or autologous Bebv+ targets but did not lyse allogeneic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells or Bebv+ cells from the same allogeneic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells or Bebv+ cells from the same allogeneic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cloned CTL were homogeneous in expressing the OK T8 molecules and in being negative for T4, T10 or M1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At any given time, 25-45% of the cloned cells manifested lytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural properties and cell surface OK T markers were different from those of cloned human NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is focused on the differences between the structural, functional and culture characteristics of CTL clones produced by direct isolation of MLC responder cells forming conjugates with specific target cells and those of clones from transformed T-cell lines or from T hybridomas </plain></SENT>
