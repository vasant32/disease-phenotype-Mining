<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine pathologic specimens with HIV-related systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, including 42 SNCC, 20 immunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (IBL), and 7 cases with features "intermediate" between SNCC and IBL were morphologically and immunophenotypically investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The host immune status was also analyzed in 57 of 69 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 29 representative SNCC <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in 9 IBL cases, and an additional 3 intermediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, both p53 protein overexpression and the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genetic information were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibiting features of the 2 established subtypes (27 Burkitt's and 15 non-Burkitt's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the seven intermediate cases, cells showed features intermediate between SNCC with plasmablastic differentiation and immunoblasts plasmacytoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblast-like cells were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53 protein overexpression and EBV association were found in a proportion of SNCC (14 of 29; 7 of 29) and intermediate (3 of 3; 2 of 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
