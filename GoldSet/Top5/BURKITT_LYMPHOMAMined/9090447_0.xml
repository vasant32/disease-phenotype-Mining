<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">Suramin</z:chebi>, a low molecular weight (1429), polyanionic compound at concentrations 105-175 microM completely abolished 125I-IFN-alpha 88 binding to Daudi cells at low temperature (4 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 37 degrees C, however, its effect was only partial and depended on incubation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">Suramin</z:chebi> also dissociated IFN-alpha 88-receptor complexes but, upon incubation of cells with IFN at 37 degrees C IFN-receptor complexes, became gradually less sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dissociation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> IFN-alpha 88-receptor complexes prevented induction of (2-5)A synthetase activity and inhibited down-regulation of IFN receptors on Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suppose that the first reaction which represents IFN binding to the surface receptors is inhibited and dissociated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi>, but when IFN is transferred to a tight activation complexes on the cell membrane or internalized, such complexes cannot be dissociated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45906">suramin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
