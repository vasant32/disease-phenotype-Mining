<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possibility that this might be due to a suppression of cdc25C phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cdc25C from interphase cells migrated as a 54- to 57-kDa doublet in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> gels and exhibited basal phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>cdc25C from mitotic cells migrated as a 66-kDa hyperphosphorylated species and exhibited elevated phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cdc25C hyperphosphorylation and activation were mediated by cdc2, supporting the view of a cdc2-cdc25C autocatalytic feedback loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies suggested cdc2-cdc25C interaction occurred within the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells arrested in G2 phase following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28925,37598">nitrogen mustard</z:chebi> treatment or cells arrested in S phase with aphidicolin failed to dephosphorylate and activate cdc2, and this correlated with failure to convert cdc25C into the most active hyperphosphorylated species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that checkpoints guarding against mitotic entry in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA suppress formation of the cdc2-cdc25C autocatalytic feedback loop that normally brings about rapid activation of cdc2 </plain></SENT>
