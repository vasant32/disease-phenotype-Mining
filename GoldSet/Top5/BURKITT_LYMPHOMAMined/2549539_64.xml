<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cDNA clones has identified the use of two different promoters (Wp and Cp), located near the left-hand end of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome, in generating these <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> messages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the activities of these two <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoters in a number of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and lymphoblastoid cell lines has revealed exclusive usage of only one of these promoters in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection of reporter constructs containing Wp and/or Cp linked to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene into several different Epstein-Barr virus-infected cell lines generally supports a model in which the mutually exclusive use of Cp or Wp is determined by cellular factors and not by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> strain variation </plain></SENT>
