<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 33 000 dalton protein (P33) is also secreted by the hybrids as part of the IgM molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since P33 and kappa chains cosegregate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> primary hybrid clones and subclones, it is concluded that they are coded for by the same human chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fact that both P33 and kappa' chains are immunoprecipitated by specific anti-human kappa chain antisera, and that both P33 and kappa' bands disappear and a single band immunoprecipitable by an anti-human kappa chain antiserum appears in tunicamycin-treated hybrid cells, suggest that they are differently glycosylated forms of the same <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
