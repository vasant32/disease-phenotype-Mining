<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although intensive chemotherapeutic regimes result in long-term disease-free survival in most patients, a significant proportion of patients will have high-risk disease that may be refractory or that will relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the role of hematopoietic SCT is not well defined, especially in the era of modern chemoimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upfront auto-SCT has been reported to be feasible in patients who have high-risk features at presentation, and in whom it is a clinical option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e>, auto-SCT can result in a PFS of 30-40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allo-SCT is an option in relapsing patients with a sibling or matched related donor who may not be eligible for, or may have previously received, an auto-SCT; the role of RIC and T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease status at transplant is the most significant predictor of outcome in patients undergoing SCT </plain></SENT>
