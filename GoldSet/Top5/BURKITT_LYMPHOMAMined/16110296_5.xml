<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 44-year-old woman in whom Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> involving both breasts was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was referred to our hospital because of a diffuse, firm swelling, like a bulky ball, in both breasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> cytology (FNAC) of both breast masses revealed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>(ML), and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed based on the results of immunohistochemical studies of a core needle biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> scan revealed very hot lesions in both breasts, but there was no evidence of disseminated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We instituted initial therapy, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (CHOP) plus intrathecal chemotherapy without performing a chromosome analysis, because the clinical course was very aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A CR was achieved, but after eight cycles of CHOP therapy, the ML relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then resected the mass in the left breast, and when examination of the surgical specimen revealed relapse of ML and t (8;11) (q24;q32) translocation, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral-blood stem cell transplantation was performed, but the patient died 10 months after her initial presentation at our hospital </plain></SENT>
