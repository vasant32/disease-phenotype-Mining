<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus produced from this line (B- LAV ) was also able to grow at a high rate in some other lymphoblastoid lines and in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This adapted strain retained the biochemical, ultrastructural, and antigenic characteristics of the original strain, as well as its tropism for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T4+ lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible to grow LAV in large quantities that can be used for the preparation of diagnostic reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction between such a human retrovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, a DNA virus, may have some implication for the pathology of the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome and related diseases </plain></SENT>
