<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells called blasts are eliminated within 7 days of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the blast count is monitored directly with the use of blood smears on the basis of specific genetic markers and immunophenotyping methods such as flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present preliminary results, obtained with the use of Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy and cluster analysis, of an approach to monitoring the progress made with chemotherapy in 1 B-cell and 2 T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric ALL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the biological marker derived from the spectra did not provide accurate prediction of the progress made with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, cluster analysis of FTIR-MSP spectra provided good classification of the samples with and without blasts, which correlate satisfactorily with clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive studies are required to substantiate our findings statistically which may have potential application of FTIM in the diagnosis and follow-up of various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
