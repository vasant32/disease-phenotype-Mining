<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have investigated the ability of human T cells to secrete IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-4 and IFN-gamma were quantified with enzymatic immunoassays and IL-2 with a biologic assay by using the murine IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBL, stimulated with Con A or with a combination of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> 13-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-12-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 secreted IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the secretion of the three lymphokines was investigated with two CD4+ clones; one (GEO-2) that produced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma and another (HY640), that produced only IL-2 and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma production was observed after only 8 h of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximal levels of IL-2 and IL-4 were found 20 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the stimulation which subsequently decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IFN-gamma levels continued to increase in a period up to 40 h and then leveled off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of these differences in secretion, the kinetics of accumulation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detectable 2 h after stimulation and continued to accumulate for a period up to 20 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a series of 22 CD4+ clones, 21 were able to secrete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three lymphokines upon stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD8+ clones were able to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but only six of the 23 CD8+ T cell clones secreted IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, five CD4+ (allo)antigen-specific T cell clones were tested for IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma secretion upon specific stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two alloantigen-specific and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid-specific T cell clones secreted IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma simultaneously, whereas one alloantigen-specific T cell clone secreted IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A supernatant of the CD4+ T cell clone GEO-2, that contained high levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4, was unable to induce the low affinity receptor for IgE, CD23, on a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, after separation of IL-4 from IFN-gamma by using HPLC, the IL-4-containing fraction-induced CD23, which could be blocked by the fraction that contained IFN-gamma and by a polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-4 antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, the partly purified IL-4, that was devoid of IL-2, promoted the growth of the clone GEO-2 </plain></SENT>
