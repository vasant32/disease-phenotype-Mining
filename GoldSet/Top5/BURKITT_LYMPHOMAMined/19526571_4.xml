<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study compared the diagnostic power of cytomorphologic analyses and FC analyses in the context of CSF <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified 32 cases of CSF submitted for cytopathologic analysis with corresponding FC data, histologic, or clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The slides were blinded and the study participants (one hematopathologist, two cytopathologists, and one cytotechnologist) reviewed the key slides of each case without additional information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These diagnoses were compared with the original diagnoses made in the context of clinical information and ancillary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of disease ranged from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parallel diagnoses were made in 62.5% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the correct diagnoses were rendered in 73% of benign cases, compared with 52% of malignant cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the malignant cases, there was a higher proportion of correct diagnosis based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (67%) versus the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 73, 52, 60, and 66% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Features most useful for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> included cellular monotony and nuclear contour irregularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> alone is difficult in CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ancillary studies such as FC analyses greatly enhance the ability to accurately distinguish between benign and malignant hematologic processes </plain></SENT>
