<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with Raji cells, and the antibody light chain kappa genes and heavy chain genes Fd from the spleen cells were amplified by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After restrictive digestion with Sac I/Xba I and Xho I/Spe I, the light chain kappa genes and heavy chain genes Fd were inserted into the phagemid vector pComb3H-SS successively and then electroporated into E.coli XL1-Blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific Fab phage antibody library against Raji cell strain in human B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was constructed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of helper phage VCSM13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific antibodies against Raji cells were obtained after selected with Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The binding activity with antigens was identified by ELISA and the positive clones were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Fab phage antibody library with 2.18 x 10(7) volume was constructed and eight positive clones which specifically recognized Raji cell strain were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the two positive clones showed that the variable heavy domains (VH) and variable light domains (VL) were highly homologous with the registered murine Ig heavy chain V region sequences and kappa light chain sequences, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fab phage antibody library was successfully constructed and specific antibodies against membrane antigens in Raji cells were obtained, which will provide an experimental foundation for the further investigation of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
