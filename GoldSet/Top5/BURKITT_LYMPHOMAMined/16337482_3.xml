<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in RFXAP are the genetic basis for complementation group D cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bare lymphocyte syndrome</z:e> (BLS) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic sequence analysis was conducted and found that only the C-terminal half of the protein is conserved among vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal third of RFXAP, which contained an extensive glutamine-rich tract, could rescue HLA-DR, but not HLA-DQ or HLA-DP expression in a BLS cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To understand this phenomenon, a detailed analysis of the role of specific sequences in the C-terminal third of RFXAP with respect to MHC-II regulation was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, mutation of the conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32677">glutamine residues</z:chebi> had no effect on activity, whereas mutation of hydrophobic and other conserved residues resulted in discoordinate MHC-II isotype expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mutation of potential phosphorylation sites abolished RFXAP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of RFXAP mutants to rescue one isotype, but not another was investigated by their ability to form RFX complexes, bind DNA in vivo, recruit CIITA to promoters and to activate a series of chimeric reporter genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that certain RFXAP mutants exaggerate isotype promoter-specific differences and form transcriptionally inefficient activation complexes with factors at the neighboring cis-acting elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show a distinction in factor recognition that is associated with specific MHC-II isotypes and may explain the basis of allele-specific expression differences </plain></SENT>
