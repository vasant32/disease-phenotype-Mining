<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No 17p anomaly was found in any patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or low-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In four cases the aberration of the short arm of chromosome 17 was the sole cytogenetic abnormality, in fourteen patients additional chromosomal aberrations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five out of 18 cases were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> showing the typical rearrangement of 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases with a karyotype evolution the 17p anomaly was always a late event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning the clinical outcome of the patients with abnormalities of the short arm of chromosome 17 eight of nineteen patients died within 90 days after the diagnosis of the 17p anomaly only three were alive at the last follow up (26 months to 40 months after diagnosis of a 17p aberration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rearrangements of 17p, especially as secondary cytogenetic events, seem to be associated with a poor clinical outcome in lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
