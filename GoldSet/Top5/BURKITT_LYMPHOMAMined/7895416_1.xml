<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genetic origins of human B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, we have used northern analysis to establish the profile of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) gene utilization in 14 Burkitt's and 10 large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the pattern of VH gene subgroup expression in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is similar to the distribution of VH subgroups utilized in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> repertoire of adult peripheral blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that these 2 types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> originate from a relatively diverse population of B cells and that antigenic drive, at least by a single antigen species, does not represent a major etiologic factor in the genesis of this class of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the utilization of genes from the VH3 subgroup by 65% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined in this study raises the possibility that antibodies directed against conserved VH3 subgroup determinant(s) may be of value in treating at least some affected individuals </plain></SENT>
