<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>siRNA studies are being conducted not only to study the effects of downregulating single genes, but also to interrogate signaling pathways and other complex interaction networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pathway analyses require both the use of relevant cellular models and methods that cause less perturbation to the cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electroporation is increasingly being used as an effective way to introduce siRNA and other nucleic acids into difficult to transfect cell lines and primary cells without altering the signaling pathway under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are multiple critical steps to a successful siRNA experiment, and there are ways to simplify the work while improving the data quality at several experimental stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To help you get started with your siRNA mediated gene knockdown project, we will demonstrate how to perform a pathway study complete from collecting and counting the cells prior to electroporation through post transfection real-time PCR gene expression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following study investigates the role of the transcriptional activator STAT6 in IL-4 dependant gene expression of CCL17 in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Namalwa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The techniques demonstrated are useful for a wide range of siRNA-based experiments on both adherent and suspension cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will also show how to streamline cell counting with the TC10 automated cell counter, how to electroporate multiple samples simultaneously using the MXcell electroporation system, and how to simultaneously assess <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> quality and quantity with the Experion automated electrophoresis system </plain></SENT>
