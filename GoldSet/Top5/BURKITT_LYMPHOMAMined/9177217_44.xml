<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two of the genes defective in the five complementation groups identified in the class II-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bare lymphocyte syndrome</z:e> or corresponding laboratory mutants have been cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One gene encodes a protein, RFX5, that is a member of the RFX family of DNA binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other, CIITA, encodes a large protein with a defined acidic transcriptional activation domain; this protein does not interact with DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression plasmids encoding regions of RFX5 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain activated transcription from a reporter construct containing GAL4 sites in a cotransfection assay in the Raji human B cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these plasmids produced transcriptional activity in HeLa cells only in conjunction with interferon gamma stimulation, a condition in which expression of both CIITA and class II major histocompatibility complex surface proteins are induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these plasmids were not active in RJ2.2.5, an in vitro mutagenized derivative of Raji in which both copies of CIITA are defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activation by the RFX5 fusion protein could be restored in RJ2.2.5 by cotransfection with a CIITA expression plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a direct interaction between RFX5 and CIITA was detected with the yeast two-hybrid and far-Western blot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, RFX5 can activate transcription only in cooperation with CIITA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RFX5 and CIITA associate to form a complex capable of activating transcription from class II major histocompatibility complex promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this complex, promoter specificity is determined by the DNA binding domain of RFX5 and the general transcription apparatus is recruited by the acidic activation domain of CIITA </plain></SENT>
