<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines that contain low levels of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are infected with EBV, transcription of the c-fgr gene is further induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we show that treatment of EBV-negative and EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> also stimulates an increase in c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, varying between 2- and 13-fold depending on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase is detectable 12 to 48 h after treatment, depending on the cell line, suggesting that the c-fgr gene is not regulated directly by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> but responds to other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>-induced changes in the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> either results in a dose-dependent decrease in growth rate, or has no effect on growth, depending on the cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has previously been suggested that the c-fgr gene product might have a role in regulating the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, since treatment of the EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line Daudi with alpha-interferon results in a decrease in c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels followed by a decrease in growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that there is no general correlation between c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and growth rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and so argue against a role for the c-fgr gene product in growth regulation in these cells </plain></SENT>
