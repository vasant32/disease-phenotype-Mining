<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of the G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> system is dependent upon the fact that, in accordance with inactivity of one X chromosome in each somatic cell, females heterozygous for the usual B gene (Gd(B)) at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> locus and the variant allele Gd(A) (or Gd(A-)) have two types of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gd(B) is active in one cell population, which consequently produces B type enzyme; in the other population Gd(A) is active, producing the variant A enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with a clonal origin in a Gd(B)/Gd(A) heterozygote should exhibit only one enzyme type (B or A) whereas those with multicellular origin may show both A and B enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilization of the immunoglobulin system is based upon the supposition that in lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with clonal origin either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or none of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells should have surface-associated IgM and kappa-reactivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>33 of 34 relatively homogeneous (with respect to content of neoplastic cells) individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e> from 19 G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> heterozygotes had single enzyme phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, of 95 tumors tested, 92 consisted essentially of IgM(+) or (-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> could not be definitely classified and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> had two cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a clonal origin for most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e>, but the one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> with a double G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> phenotype (A/B) and the one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> that had two populations of cells with respect to surface IgM, could have originated from multiple cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was determined in each of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from seven heterozygotes and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had the same single enzyme phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surface-associated IgM was tested in four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from one patient, three from another, and in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> from 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With one exception, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> from the same patient were concordant with respect to IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the entire disease has a clonal origin, i.e., it emerges at one focus and then spreads to other parts of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cells from 36 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were typed for G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> (in heterozygotes) and/or IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In one previously reported patient, initial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e> were discordant for G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two other patients had IgM phenotypes in recurrences that were discordant with those found in their initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes from three of nine relapses which occurred after 5 mo were discordant for G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> or IgM but no discordance was detected among 27 earlier recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, some "late" recurrences may be due to emergence of "new" maligant cell lines whereas most early relapses are due to reemergence of the original malignant clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The probable unicellular origin of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrences are discussed in terms of the disease's putative <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> etiology </plain></SENT>
