<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As consolidation of his second remission, he underwent high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to prove whether the second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was a relapse of the first or a second primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we obtained paraffin-embedded material from both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from this material and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus JH and VH region primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the PCR products, which mostly reflects VDJ joints, showed two sharp bands of different molecular size, proving the monoclonal nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and suggesting that each had different Ig gene rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of both PCR products showed a marked dissimilarity in nucleotide sequence in the clonally unique VDJ joint region, providing strong evidence for the separate cellular genesis of each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that late relapses of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be examined for clonal distinctiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is distinct from the primary one, it might be treated as a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> rather than as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
