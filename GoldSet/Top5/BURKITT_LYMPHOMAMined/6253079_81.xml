<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long unique region <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e> of the DNA of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> isolate, W91, is 9 X 10(6) daltons longer than the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e> of B95-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "additional DNA and the regions around it have been cloned from W91 and another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> isolate, AG876 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The additional DNA is <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and not cellular, since W91 and AG876 have almost identical additional DNA, and there is no detectable homology to human lymphocyte DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insertion site of the additional DNA is within the 0.96 X 10(6) dalton Hinf 1 fragment of B95-8 Bam Hl l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and transformation of five cell lines B95-8 did not pick up additional DNA in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hybridization of labeled DNAs from three EBV-infected cell lines derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> to blots of fragments of the additional DNA indicates that these sequences are present in American as well as in African virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B95-8 is therefore an unusual deletion derivative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A newly discovered feature of EBV DNAs is that sequences which map near the left end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UL</z:e> have homology to part of the additional DNA </plain></SENT>
