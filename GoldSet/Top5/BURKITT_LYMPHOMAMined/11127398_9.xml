<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and its treatment on thrombin generation (TAT levels) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated 32 children (23 M, 9 F) aged between 1 and 15 years (mean 6) affected by ALL (immunophenotypic subgroups: 16 common, 7 T, and 9 pre-B type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients TAT levels at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and after 5-6 doses of L-asparaginase were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TAT levels were higher in patients both at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (13.04 +/- 10.90 ng/L) and after the 5-6 doses of L-asp (19.41 +/- 11.05 ng/L) with respect to controls (4 +/- 1 ng/L) (p &lt; .001 and p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAT levels after 5-6 doses of L-asp were higher than those at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factorial ANOVA showed that at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> there was a significant effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> immunophenotypic subgroups upon TAT levels (p &lt; .05) and no effect of inherited thrombotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in children with ALL an important role is played by acquired thrombotic risk factors, among which the indirect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> procoagulant activity has its importance </plain></SENT>
