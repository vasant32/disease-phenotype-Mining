<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although remarkable successes in the treatment of the disease have been observed, when compared with paediatric patients, adults are less likely to reach stable complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 32 BL cases, composed in equal part by adults and children that were treated with the French LMB regimen, for factors that may be implicated in chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical detection of procaspase-8, caspase-3a, survivin, p53, CD95, c-Flip and Phospho-RelA (Ser536) was investigated on paraffin-embedded tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-Flip was found highly related to a poor prognosis, mostly characterized by adults with a chemoresistant disease, resulting in a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate within the first year of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival with c-Flip expression was 24% compared with 93% in the absence of this marker (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> c-Flip-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases presented a nuclear Phospho-RelA (Ser536) localization, suggesting the presence of an active nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B transcription pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that c-Flip could be a reliable prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, suggesting new therapeutic approaches that target the NF-kappa B pathway </plain></SENT>
