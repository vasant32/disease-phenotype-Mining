<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are remarkably low in eastern Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunological and clinico-pathological analyses suggested that the estimated rate of incidence of extra-nodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan is not very different from that in the U.S.A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, their primary sites differ as seen in gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, most of which are included in extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is interesting epidemiologically that patients with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whose distribution is closely correlated with that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in both countries, is much rarer in Japan than in the U.S.A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the epidemiological viewpoint, extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Japan could be classified by the difference in possible risk factors as follows; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the alimentary tract, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of solid organs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the liver and spleen, medullary or extramedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify the possible risk factors for each type of extranodal B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> of B-cell type, it seems necessary to conduct collaborative nationwide epidemiological studies in Japan </plain></SENT>
