<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>JL1 is a novel molecule expressed in the surface of hematopoietic precursor cells, but not on any other mature human tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, JL1 is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells and can be used both for specific diagnosis and as a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, expression of JL1 by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> has not been thoroughly assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a potentially curable aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but prognostic markers that stratify risk have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore assayed JL1 expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients to assess its value as a prognostic marker for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarray blocks of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, at the Asan Medical Center and Seoul National University Hospital from January 1998 to December 2008 were immunohistochemically assayed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against JL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 30.2% of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, but no other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> samples, were positive for JL1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>JL-1 expression was significantly correlated with patient survival (P = 0.022), but not with other clinical manifestations of the disease, with 91.6% of JL1-positive patients achieving complete remission in response to chemotherapy and 6.25% experiencing disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JL1 positivity was significantly correlated with prolonged overall survival by both Kaplan-Meier survival (P = 0.035) and Cox proportional hazard model (P = 0.043) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>JL1 expression in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was positively correlated with overall survival and better response to chemotherapy, suggesting that JL1 may be a prognostic marker for risk stratification in these patients </plain></SENT>
