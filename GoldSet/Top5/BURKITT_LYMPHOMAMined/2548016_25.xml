<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One approach to further delineate these mechanisms is to identify cellular genes whose expression is augmented in cells latently infected with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells can be grown in continuous culture and EBV can establish growth-altering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> in these cells, some effects of EBV on B-lymphocyte gene expression can be studied by using this in vitro system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pursuing this latter approach, we have used cDNA cloning and subtractive hybridization to identify a gene whose expression is increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes the cytoskeletal protein vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Latent infection</z:e> of established EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines with the transforming EBV strain, B95-8, resulted in dramatic increases in vimentin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with the nontransforming P3HR1 strain failed to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vimentin induction was reproduced by the expression of the single EBV gene which encodes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> membrane protein (LMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An amino-terminal LMP deletion mutant did not induce vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are of particular interest in light of the transforming potential of LMP, as demonstrated in rodent fibroblasts, and the interaction between vimentin and LMP observed in immunofluorescent colocalization and cell fractionation studies </plain></SENT>
