<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For better characterization of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the expression of immunohistochemical markers of cell differentiation (CD10, Bcl-6, MUM-1) and determine cell origin profile according to Hans' classification of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study included 72 consecutive patients with ARL diagnosed at the University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and at the Brazilian Instituto Nacional de CÃ¢ncer (INCA) from 2000 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morphologic distribution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> was the following: 61% were diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCLs</z:e>), 15% were Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 13% were plasmablastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 10% were high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and 1% was follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests particular findings in ARL, as the most frequent phenotype was GC, different from HIV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
