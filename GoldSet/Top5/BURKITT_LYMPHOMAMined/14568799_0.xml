<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: DNA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> viruses potentially play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the head and neck (SCCHN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Human papillomavirus</z:e> is found in up to 50% of SCCHN specimens, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been detected in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of EBV in nonnasopharyngeal SCCHN has not been thoroughly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one SCCHN cell lines derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of various subsites were used to screen for EBV DNA as well as latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method of EBV DNA detection was polymerase chain reaction with 3 independent primer sets from distinct regions of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein EBNA-1, critical for the maintenance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> episome, was monitored by immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 12 paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens were further characterized by immunohistochemistry with the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Little or no EBV DNA was detected in 20 of 21 cell lines or in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens, while detecting approximately 40 genome copies in a control reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, these cell lines and specimens were negative for EBNA-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 cell line derived from an immunosuppressed patient, EBV DNA was detected, and on further examination a small percentage of cells expressed EBNA-1 as shown by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although EBV may not be a major cofactor contributing to the proliferation of SCCHN, the limited initial evidence suggests that EBV may be involved in development of SCCHN in immunosuppressed patients </plain></SENT>
