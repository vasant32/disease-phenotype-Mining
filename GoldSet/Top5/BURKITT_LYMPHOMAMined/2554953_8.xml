<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation of cells with recombinant H ferritin followed by antibodies to the H subunit produced a labelling pattern in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells showed strong fluorescent stippling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Corresponding experiments with liver ferritin and an antibody to the L subunit revealed that most cells were lightly stippled, but 3-5% of the cells were intensely labelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two labelling patterns were distinct as assessed by cross-blocking experiments with recombinant H and liver ferritins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results imply that different binding sites exist for each subunit </plain></SENT>
