<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> can be hypothesized to invade locally and to metastatize via mechanisms similar to those developed by a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, i.e., the secretion of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes and stimulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess this hypothesis, Namalwa, Raji, and Daudi cell lines (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), LIK and SB cell lines (B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), CEM and Jurkat cell lines (T-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>), and U266 cell line (<z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>) were evaluated for their capacity to produce matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cell lines were also assessed for their ability: (1) to produce the angiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor; (2) to induce an angiogenic phenotype in cultured endothelial cells, represented by cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and morphogenesis; (3) to stimulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in different in vivo experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cell lines expressed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for one or both metalloproteinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Namalwa, Raji, LIK, SB, and U266 cells secreted the active form of both metalloproteinases, while Daudi, CEM, and Jurkat cells produced metalloproteinase-2 but not-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urokinase-type plasminogen activator was secreted only by SB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While Raji, LIK, SB, CEM, and Jurkat cells secreted both basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, Daudi and U266 cells produced only the former, and Namalwa cells only the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the conditioned medium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines stimulated cell proliferation and/or chemotaxis in cultured endothelial cells, with the exception of that of Namalwa cells which was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conditioned medium of CEM and Jurkat cells induced morphogenesis in cultured endothelial cells grown on a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, Namalwa, Raji, LIK, SB, U266, CEM, and Jurkat cells induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and mononuclear cell recruitment in the murine Matrigel sponge model and in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in both models was strictly correlated with the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> cells possess both local and remote invasive ability via the secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> which is fostered by host inflammatory cells and by an intervening ensemble of angiogenic factors </plain></SENT>
