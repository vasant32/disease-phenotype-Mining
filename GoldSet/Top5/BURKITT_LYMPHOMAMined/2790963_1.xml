<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Modulation of surface antigens of Raji Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells by monoclonal antibody Lym-1 was investigated by flow cytometry and radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Raji cells, treated with antibody conjugated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>, became bright green as determined by FACS and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labeled Lym-1 remained associated with target cells for up to 48 hr after incubation at either 4 or 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lym-1 antibody linked with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> also bound to Raji cells and rendered these cells highly reactive with avidin-phycoerythrin (APE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the APE fluorescence intensity measured by FACS decreased substantially when Raji cells were cultured at 37 degrees C for 1 hr prior to APE exposure but not when incubation was carried out at 4 degrees C, indicating a disappearance of antibody from the surface of the metabolically active cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This process was time dependent with a total loss of surface-bound biotinylated antibody occurring over a period of approximately 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raji cells exposed to both fluoresceinated and biotinylated Lym-1 in a double labeling experiment became positive to both reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flow cytometric profile was not altered when these cells were incubated for 1 hr at 4 degrees C followed by reaction with APE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they failed to react with APE when the 1-hr incubation took place at 37 degrees C despite the fact that they remained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> positive, suggesting that the antibody with its fluorescent label had entered the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Utilizing 131I-labeled Lym-1 it was determined that approximately 50% of initially bound antibody had dissociated from the cells within the first 2 hr of incubation at 37 degrees C, although the remainder persisted with targets for up to 48 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HPLC protein profile indicated that the radioactivity found in the culture supernatants and cytoplasm was associated with whole antibody, degradation products, and Ig complexes with antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present findings suggest that Lym-1 Ig molecules react with cell surface antigens and are rapidly internalized and shed, resulting in the disappearance of antibody from the surface membrane of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
