<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here that this partial resistance was overridden in two independent stable somatic cell hybrids prepared by fusion between sensitive and resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcribed from the active allele of the resistant parent cell was reduced by interferon within the context of the cell hybrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was therefore concluded that changes in the cis-acting sequences of c-myc were not involved in this type of relaxed regulation and that resistance resulted rather from inactivation or loss of postreceptor elements which operate in trans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The growth-stimulating effect that this genetic deregulation might have on cells was tested in experimental systems of cell differentiation in which an autocrine interferon is produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For that purpose we isolated variant clones of M1 myeloid cells which were partially resistant to alpha and beta interferons and tested their growth behavior during in vitro-induced differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resistant clones displayed higher proliferative activity on days 2 and 3 of differentiation than did the sensitive clones, which stopped proliferating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The loss of c-myc responses to the self-produced interferon disrupted the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cessation of growth during differentiation and therefore might lead cells along the pathway of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
