<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither the capacity for synthesis, degradation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>), generally lower in the T than B cell lines, nor deamination of ara-C, negligible in the B cell lines, could be correlated to the drug sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, significant correlation was obtained between the sensitivity and the plateau level of ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We consider that ara-C sensitivity could be predicted by measuring the plateau ara-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> level before commencement of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
