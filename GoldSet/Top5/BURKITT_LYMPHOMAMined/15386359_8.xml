<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CD40 receptor and the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein LMP1 are both members of the TNF-receptor family and share several signaling mediators, including TRAF2 and TRAF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the cell lineage and stage of maturation, LMP1 and CD40 can have synergistic, <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> or unrelated effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous publications have suggested that both TRAF2 and TRAF3 move into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts upon LMP1 expression or CD40 activation, whereas their proteolysis is only enhanced by CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However CD40-induced proteolysis of TRAF2 has only been reported in murine cells, and there are conflicting data regarding translocation of TRAF2 into <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated TRAF2 and TRAF3 modifications induced by CD40 and LMP1 signaling in a panel of human cell lines of lymphoid and epithelial origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon CD40 stimulation, a marked redistribution of TRAF2 into the buoyant raft fraction was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines and was often associated with a similar redistribution of TRAF3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only TRAF3 was redistributed into the raft fraction upon LMP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover parallel changes in subcellular distribution of TRAF2 and TRAF3 were recorded by electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in TRAF2 and TRAF3 concentrations triggered by CD40 ligation was observed in only 1 cell line and there was no evidence that this decrease was required for the negative feed-back on JNK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TRAF2 redistribution into raft-like complexes thus appears as the most significant event distinctive of CD40 and LMP1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the parallel influence of CD40 and LMP1 on TRAF3 redistribution is consistent with functional similarities between the CD40-TRAF3 and LMP1-TRAF3 axes </plain></SENT>
