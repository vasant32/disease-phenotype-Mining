<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to seek out new factors that are related to colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> at the molecular level, subtractive hybridization between cDNA of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent screenings of the cDNA libraries, constructed from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosal tissues, using the "subtractive probes" generated a total of 46 clones that were expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa but were either expressed at a significantly reduced level or not expressed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Partial nucleotide sequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cDNA clones were determined, and sequence homology analyses were performed with the Genbank database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 46 cDNA samples, 44 contained substantial sequence homologies with 32 immunoglobulin gene fragments, a helix-loop-helix basic phosphoprotein gene, an acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P2 gene, a BLR1 gene for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1 gene, D5S419 DNA segment containing (C-A) repeats, a glucokinase (GCK) gene, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, K+-ATPase alpha-subunit gene, a histocompatibility system HLA-DR heavy-chain gene, a dystrophic gene, a mucin (MUC2) gene, a mu-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase gene, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MNK">Menkes disease</z:e> protein gene, and a 40-kDa keratin intermediate filament precursor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining two cDNA clones (now registered under GenBank accession numbers U17714 and U20428) showed few (less than 60%) sequence homologies with any known sequences in the GenBank database and, therefore, may represent novel genes whose expression was down-regulated in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible clinical significance of these findings and the involvement of these two genes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of colorectal as well as other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are being investigated </plain></SENT>
