<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the requirement for intimate contact between bone marrow stroma and B lymphoblasts from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By scanning electron microscopy, both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic cells seeded onto stroma were surrounded by folds of stromal cells or were linked to the stroma by fine tendrils and uropods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Separation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B progenitors from stroma by use of microporous membranes led to significantly lower cell recoveries compared with results when contact was unimpeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For instance, 22.5% +/- 1.8% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of CD19+, CD34+ cells (most immature subset) were recovered after a 7-day culture directly on stroma, compared with 5.2% +/- 0.7% after growth on membranes (P &lt; .001 by Student's t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 11 cases of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, separation of progenitors from stroma resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and a greater than 60% reduction in cell recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 cases, however, this effect was much less pronounced, with reductions in cell recoveries ranging from 48.5% to less than 1% (median, 39.0%) of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of very late antigen-4, a surface molecule critical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of B lymphoblasts to stroma, was associated with a greater loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ B progenitors compared with that for equivalent leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results establish direct contact with stroma as a survival requirement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphoblasts and show marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in stromal dependency among B-lineage leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
