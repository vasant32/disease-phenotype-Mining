<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated nuclei from control and treated samples were used for the kinetic analysis of in vitro <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results have shown that interferon treatment induces a reduction of the transcriptional and replicative activities within 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitant to these results is the modification of the organization of nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity and distribution of silver grains are, in fact, different in treated cells nucleoli as compared to those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the number and the arrangement of granules could be related to the functional state of the cells suggesting that the transient cascade of interferon-generated signals involves also modulation of nucleolar structure and function in accordance with the hypothesis of a relationship of cell proliferation rate to silver-stained nucleolar protein quantity </plain></SENT>
