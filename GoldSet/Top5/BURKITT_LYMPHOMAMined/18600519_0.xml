<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined changes at the protein level induced in the Raji cell line (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) by fludarabine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> (FdA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cells are sensitive to FdA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raji cells treated with FdA (3 micro M, 24 hours), accumulate multiple phosphorylated forms of p53 in the nucleus that in turn degrade to phosphorylated forms of p40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using CD antibody microarrays to determine surface expression profiles for Raji cells treated with FdA, we found up-regulation of the following CD antigens: CD20, CD54, CD80, CD86, and CD95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FdA thus induces changes in the genetic program of the cells that might be exploited to obtain synergy with therapeutic antibodies </plain></SENT>
