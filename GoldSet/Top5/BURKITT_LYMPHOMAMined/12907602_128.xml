<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) at the maximum tolerable dose with 21-day breaks or at more frequent low-dose (metronomic) schedules have opposite effects on the mobilization and viability of circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs) in immunodeficient mice bearing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with the maximum tolerable dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> experienced a robust CEP mobilization a few days after the end of a cycle of drug administration, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> rapidly became drug resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the administration of metronomic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> was associated with a consistent decrease in CEP numbers and viability and with more durable inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that metronomic low-dose chemotherapy regimens are particularly promising for avoiding CEP mobilization and, hence, to potentially reduce vasculogenesis-dependent mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
