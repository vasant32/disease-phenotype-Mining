<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells did not grow without feeder cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As with the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, BALM-18 showed an immunophenotype of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group I [CD10+, CD20+, CD23-, CD39-, CD77+] and carried the t(8;14)(q24;q32) chromosomal abnormality which is highly associated with ALL-L3 and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also revealed a significantly low level of bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, anti-human IgM antibody did induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in induction experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was reversed by the addition of anti-CD40 antibody or BST cells, whereas the culture supernatant of the stroma cells did not show any effect on the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BALM-18 may be useful for analyzing both the mechanisms of anti-IgM induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and signaling during the inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD40 or BST cells </plain></SENT>
