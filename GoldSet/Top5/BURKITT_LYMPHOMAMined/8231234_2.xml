<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proliferative response and the capacity to secrete IgM was measured in B-CLL and B-MLUS, respectively, and compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAC and a mAb against CD40 were used as stimulatory agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No cell population responded to anti-CD40 mAb alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAC only induced a high DNA synthesis rate in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells as well as in B-CLL cells, although the magnitude was three-fold lower and delayed for about 48 h in B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B-MLUS cells did not proliferate in response to SAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of anti-CD40 and SAC enhanced the proliferative capacity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells and produced a more rapid response in B-CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B-MLUS cells were not activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> B-cells and B-MLUS did not secrete IgM after SAC stimulation, while B-CLL cells had a continuous increase in the IgM production during a 6-day culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher proliferative capacity of B-CLL cells compared with B-MLUS cells may be explained by an increased expression of activation molecules e.g. receptors for various cytokines and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the inertness and inability of B-MLUS cells in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B- and B-CLL cells to respond to powerful activation signals might indicate an intrinsic defect of B-MLUS cells in the signal transduction leading to a block of mitosis and a benign course of the disease </plain></SENT>
