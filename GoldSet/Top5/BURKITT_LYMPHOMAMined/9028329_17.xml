<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of MSI in non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) has not been conclusively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have tested the presence of MSI in 69 cases of B-cell NHL (B-NHL) representative of the various histologic categories of the disease and including 17 cases of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>)-related B-NHL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, for selected B-NHL cases, consecutive samples obtained before and after clinical progression (with and without concomitant histologic transformation) were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five distinct microsatellite repeats (2 dinucleotide, 2 trinucleotide, and 1 tetranucleotide repeats) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSI, defined by the presence of microsatellite alterations in two or more of the five microsatellite loci tested, was not found in NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a previous study reporting the frequent association between MSI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL, we found this abnormality in only 1 of 17 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL representative of the major subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data indicate that defects in DNA mismatch repair do not contribute significantly to the molecular pathogenesis of B-NHL </plain></SENT>
