<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was previously shown that the chromosome 19 breakpoint of the t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocation, found in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004812'>pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo>, is within the E2A transcription factor gene on chromosome 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cell line with this translocation contains two novel chimeric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, both with the same 5'E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3' sequence from a previously unrecognized gene dubbed prl, located on chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chimeric <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> encode a protein that lacks 171 amino acids of E2A, including its DNA binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a homeobox-related sequence from prl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the production of a chimeric E2A-Prl protein may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes normally responsive to the Prl homeoprotein </plain></SENT>
