<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about genomic aberration in PEL, and only a few HIV-negative PEL have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the results of chromosomal analysis and comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) conducted to detect regions of gain and loss, in five HIV-negative Japanese cases of HHV-8-negative PEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one (35-year-old female) were elderly men and the morphologic examination showed large cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PEL expressed B-cell-associated and activation-associated antigens, and exhibited clonal immunoglobulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No HHV-8 was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four examined cases, but Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic abnormalities and aberrations were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HHV-8/HIV-negative PEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CGH studies showed gain in 19 of 24 chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gains of 3q13-27, 8q24, 10q21-23 and Yq were detected in two of the five cases, but other gains were noted in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis revealed complex abnormalities both in numbers and structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated t(8;22) was detected in one case, but +8 chromosome and c-myc amplification were detected in the other three cases by Southern blot and/or fluorecence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormality of chromosome 8, which associates with c-myc, was detected in four of the five HHV-8/HIV-negative PEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the other common genomic abnormalities of HHV-8/HIV-negative PEL were not detected in our study, but the complex abnormalities seemed to be true rather than the usual large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that multi-step genomic abnormalities might be associated in HHV-8/HIV-negative PEL <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
