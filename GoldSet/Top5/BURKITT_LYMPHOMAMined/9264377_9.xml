<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD95 (Fas/<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1) is a cell surface receptor able to trigger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a variety of cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression and function of the CD95 antigen on leukemic blasts from 42 patients with B lineage and 53 patients with T lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) were investigated using immunofluorescence staining and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD95 surface antigen was expressed in most ALL cases, with the T lineage ALL usually showing a higher intensity of surface CD95 expression as compared with the B lineage ALL cells (relative fluorescence intensity, RFI: 4.8 +/- 0.47 vs 2.2 +/- 0.23, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional studies disclosed that upon oligomerization by anti-CD95 monoclonal antibodies the CD95 protein was either not able to initiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of leukemic cells (75% of cases) or induced low rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (20% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in 5% of cases did the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate exceed the 20% level of the CD95-specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the CD95-sensitive cases were found among T lineage ALLs (38% of T lineage vs 10% of B lineage ALLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the extent of CD95-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> did not correlate with the expression level of CD95 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no significant correlation between expression level and functionality of CD95 in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines of B and T cell origin could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein has been associated with prolonged cell survival and has been shown to block partially CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but for ALL cells no correlation between bcl-2 expression and spontaneous or CD95-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in this study indicate that, despite constitutive expression of CD95, the ALL cells are mainly resistant to CD95-triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More detailed investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved in the intracellular apoptotic signal transduction, such as interactions of the bcl-2 and the other members of the bcl-2 family, and functionality of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) like-proteases, may give new insights into key events responsible for the resistance or sensitivity to the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
