<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we address the consequences of EBER expression for PKR activation in vivo in response to alpha interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In agreement with published findings, either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> or the EBERs alone protected Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells from alpha-interferon-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, utilizing multiple phosphorylation state-specific antibodies to monitor PKR activation within cells in response to interferon, we demonstrate that the EBERs are unable to inhibit phosphorylation of either cytoplasmic or nuclear PKR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, a direct substrate of PKR, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha), was equally phosphorylated in EBV-positive and EBV-negative cells following interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, EBER inhibition of alpha-interferon-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and potentially other PKR-mediated events, is unlikely to be mediated through direct inhibition of PKR, as previously thought </plain></SENT>
