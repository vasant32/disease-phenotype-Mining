<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many NHL are thought to result from errors in class switch recombination and/or somatic hypermutation, processes that occur in germinal center B cells, and require the activity of activation induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> deaminase (AID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since NHL is a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, and expression of AID could contribute to the development of NHL, we hypothesized that AID expression would be elevated in those who went on to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated NHL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AID <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were measured by TaqMan RT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, obtained prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL diagnosis, from 16 HIV-infected subjects who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL, and from control subjects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> but no NHL, and HIV-negative subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBMC AID expression was markedly elevated in those who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL, when compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and HIV-negative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, AID expression was seen to differ depending on NHL subtype, with the highest levels of expression seen in those who developed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
