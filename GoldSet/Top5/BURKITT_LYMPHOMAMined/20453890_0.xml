<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the development of a genetic system for the detection of T(12;15)(Igh-Myc) translocations in plasma cells of a mouse strain in which an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding reporter gene has been targeted to Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the PCTs that developed in the newly generated translocation reporter mice, designated iGFP(5'Myc), expressed GFP consequent to naturally occurring T(12;15) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GFP expression did not interfere with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> development or the deregulation of Myc on derivative 12 of translocation, der (12), because the reporter gene was allocated to the reciprocal product of translocation, der (15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the described reporter gene approach requires refinement before T(12;15) translocations can be quantitatively detected in vivo, including in B lymphocyte lineage cells that have not yet completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e>, our findings provide proof of principle that reporter gene tagging of oncogenes in gene-targeted mice can be used to elucidate unresolved questions on the occurrence, distribution and trafficking of cells that have acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-causing chromosomal translocations of great relevance for humans </plain></SENT>
