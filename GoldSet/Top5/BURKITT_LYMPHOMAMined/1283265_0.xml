<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, VLA-4 binds to VCAM-1 and ICAM-2, thus mediating intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> prerogative for lymphocyte extravasation or "homing" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using frozen tissue of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid organs and of 100 morphologically and immunologically typed B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo>, monoclonal antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six VLA-alpha subunits and to the common beta 1-chain were applied to serial sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VLAs were found differentially expressed in cytologically and microtopographically defined B cell subsets [follicular mantle zone cells (MZ), follicular center cells (FC), extrafollicular cells (EF), and plasma cells (PC)] of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spleen, lymph node, and thymic medulla (which contains an EF compartment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, these cell types, which correspond to discrete stages of B cell development, can also be defined by their VLA status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> B lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was VLA-1-, 2-, 3 +/-, 4 +/-, 5 +/-, 6- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VLA-1-, -2 +/-, -3+, -4+, -5+, -6- phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) resembled that of MZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL) differed from CLL in its tendency to lack VLA-2, in its consistent lack of VLA-3, and altogether resembled splenic EF in its VLA profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mantle zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MZL</z:e>) consistently expressed VLA-3 and -4 and frequently VLA-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nodal follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (FCCL) were VLA-1- and -2- and very rarely expressed VLA-5 and -6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, FCCL although roughly corresponding to FC, tended to aberrantly express VLA-3 and/or VLA-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> resembled FCCL but expressed VLA-4 more frequently and at higher levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
