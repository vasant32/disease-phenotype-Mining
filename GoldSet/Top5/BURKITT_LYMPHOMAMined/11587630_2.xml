<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiographic imaging showed extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030469" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paranasal sinus disease</z:e>, presumed to be <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, and the patients were treated with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients were unresponsive to oral agents and were switched to intravenous antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy, one patient (case 1) developed increased periorbital swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, and the other patient (case 2) developed symptoms of nasopharyngeal obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat imaging showed progression of the infiltrative process extending from the paranasal sinuses into the orbit (case 1), and nasopharynx (case 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration and tissue biopsies were performed on both patients and the histopathology was consistent with Burkitt's/Burkitt's-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
