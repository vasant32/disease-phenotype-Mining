<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, there is a growing population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e> survivors in which the long-term genotoxic effects of chemotherapy is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that children treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> have significantly elevated somatic mutant frequencies at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene in their peripheral T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular etiology of the increase in mutant frequencies following chemotherapy, we investigated the HPRT mutation spectra and the extent of clonal proliferation in 562 HPRT T cell mutant isolates of 87 blood samples from 47 subjects at diagnosis, during chemotherapy, and postchemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant increase in the proportion of CpG transitions following treatment (13.6-23.3%) compared with healthy controls (4.0%) and a significant decrease in V(D)J-mediated deletions following treatment (0-6.8%) compared with healthy controls (17.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant change in the class type percentage of V(D)J-mediated HPRT deletions following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a &gt;5-fold increase in T cell receptor gene usage-defined mean clonal proliferation from diagnosis compared with the completion of chemotherapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that unique genetic alterations and extensive clonal proliferation are occurring in children following treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> that may influence long-term risks for multifactorial diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
