<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined SDF-1alpha-mediated responses of cells from 27 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although cells from the majority of cases showed chemotactic and proliferative responses to SDF-1alpha, a subset of cases did not undergo chemotaxis in response to SDF-1alpha, while still demonstrating dependence on SDF-1alpha for proliferation in stroma-supported cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This chemotactic defect was associated with an absence of phosphorylation of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by SDF-1alpha, and of SDF-1alpha-induced augmentation of beta(1) integrin-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signaling through <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase and MEK was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between CXCR4 expression and chemotactic function, in vitro migration into bone marrow stromal layers, and engraftment of leukemic cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that signaling through p38 MAPK is required for ALL cell chemotaxis but not for proliferation, and that the loss of a chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha does not impede engraftment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
