<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cross-linking of CD80 on B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation in 160-, 120-, 55-, 46- and 44-kDa proteins, which was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD80-mediated signaling resulted in the inhibition of DNA replication of B cells and induced the changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> like macrophages or fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cell spreading was inhibited by the pre-treatment of the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the CD80 antigen is involved in transmembrane outside-in signaling in B cells and its biological effects appear to be mediated by tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
