<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of T-cell-derived BCGF-12kD on human B-cell autocrine growth-associated functions, we cultured Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-transformed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells (LCL 72285) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (Raji) in the presence or absence of BCGF-12kD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When cultured in media supplemented only with fetal calf serum, the LCL and Raji cell lines maintained relatively high levels of episomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a similar level of proliferation could be maintained under defined culture conditions in media supplemented with BCGF-12kD, these conditions resulted in a time-dependent reduction of EBV sequences, as detected with EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA-1 and EBNA-2) gene probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that stimulation with T-cell-derived BCGF-12kD can alter a regulatory step which may be involved in the EBV transformation of B cells </plain></SENT>
