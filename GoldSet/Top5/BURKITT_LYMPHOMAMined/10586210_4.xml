<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In a prior study, primary resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (RES-ALL) was observed in 11 of 176 (6%) adult patients treated with a four drug regimen (IVAP), its incidence being higher in T-cell or Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome/BCR-ABL rearrangement positive ALL cases with a blast cell count &gt;25x10(9)/L (RES-ALL rate 19%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aiming to minimize this percentage of resistant disease, fractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (f-CY) was then added to the IVAP regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Study 08-96 was a prospective, collaborative phase II trial carried out at eight general hospital centers specialized in the care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Historical IVAP-treated patients served as a retrospective control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive, untreated patients (&gt;15 years) with a diagnosis of ALL or advanced-stage lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LBL) were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RES-ALL was defined as the persistence of &gt;5% ALL cells in the bone marrow 28-40 days after the start of the IVAP regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42068">idarubicin</z:chebi> 10 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 and 2; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> 2 mg on days 1, 8 and 15; L-asparaginase 6,000 U/m(2) on alternate days 3 6 from day 8; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 60 mg/m(2)/d on days 1-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the new study, two f-CY schedules were sequentially adopted: CY 150 or 75 mg/m(2)/bd, given for 4 consecutive days before IVAP (f-CY 1200 or 600, expressing total CY dose in mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were evaluable (age range 15-74 years, blast count 0-240x10(9)/L, 14 T-lineage, 74 B-lineage, 13 Ph/BCR-ABL+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The first 39 patients received the f-CY 1200 schedule, 22 patients received f-CY 600, and the last 27 patients were not given any f-CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were dictated by the results of interim analyses of the f-CY groups (RES-ALL rate not reduced, myelotoxicity increased) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether, compared with the historical IVAP and no f-CY groups, the incidence of RES-ALL was not decreased by the addition of f-CY 1200/600 in B-lineage ALL, regardless of Ph/BCR-ABL expression and blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, none of 14 T-ALL cases in the new study had RES-ALL (8 in f-CY groups, 5 of whom with &gt;25x10(9)/L blast cells), compared to 5/39 (13%, overall) or 4/21 (19%, with &gt;25x10(9)/L blast cells) among the control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Owing to small sample size, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> may be more sensitive than B-lineage ALL to an early therapy including f-CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis could be tested in a larger clinical trial </plain></SENT>
