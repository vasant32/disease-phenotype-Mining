<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the feasibility and efficacy of hyperfractionated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (hyper-CVAD), a dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, as well as the possible impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (six patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>; seven patients) were treated with hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and ara-C for a total of eight cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received HAART from the start of induction chemotherapy (seven patients) or later in the course of chemotherapy (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median patient age was 43 years (range, 32-55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were diagnosed with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at the time of diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; the other 4 patients had been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> for a median of 37 months (range, 18-137) prior to the diagnosis of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median absolute CD4 count from the 9 patients with evaluable counts was 77 cells/microL (range, 9-544); only one patient had a count &gt; 200/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and one achieved a partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients continued in CR after a median of 31 months (range, 7-45) at the time of writing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients were alive and in CR over two years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 12 months, with 48% of patients alive after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six of seven patients who received HAART from the start of chemotherapy were alive and in CR after a median of 29 months (range, 7-45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The four patients who did not receive HAART died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The regimen was universally myelosuppressive, but the toxicity profiles, recoveries from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, and incidences of infectious complications were similar to that of non-HIV patients with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> treated with the same regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-CVAD is an effective regimen for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, with acceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The combination of hyper-CVAD and HAART is associated with long-term survival in patients with the two diseases, which, until recently, were both considered invariably fatal and almost futile to treat medically </plain></SENT>
