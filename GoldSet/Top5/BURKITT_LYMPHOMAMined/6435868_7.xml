<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>2',5'-Oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase, which polymerizes <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> into 2-5A, is induced upon treatment of cells with interferon (IFN) and is thought to be involved in its antiviral and anticellular action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) enhanced the level of this enzyme in two human transformed cell lines, WISH and Namalva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like IFN, RA induced 2-5A synthetase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of anti IFN-alpha, -IFN-beta, or -IFN-gamma antibodies to the medium concomitantly with RA did not prevent such induction; therefore, the effect of RA is clearly not mediated through the induction and externalization of IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> inhibited 2-5A synthetase induction by RA, suggesting that RA increased the transcription of the 2-5A synthetase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In WISH cells, the growth of encephalomyocarditis virus was inhibited by RA treatment, which is consistent with the hypothesis that 2-5A synthetase plays an important role in the antiviral action of IFN, at least in encephalomyocarditis virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the anticellular effects of IFN and RA were compared to their ability to induce 2-5A synthetase activity in four human cell lines, there was no strict correlation between the amplitude of the enzyme activity induced and the extent of the antiproliferative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the 2-5A system is probably not the only pathway responsible for the antiproliferative effect of both substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further suggest that the induction of 2-5A synthetase by IFN and RA might be connected with at least some of the similarities observed between other biological effects of both compounds </plain></SENT>
