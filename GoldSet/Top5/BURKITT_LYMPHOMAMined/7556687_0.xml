<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The loss of one of these affects the cellular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, OKB7, the anti-CR2 MoAb, recognizes C3d determinants on the cell surface and inhibits signal transduction induced by anti-C3d polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since Raji cells are always CR2 positive during cell growth, we suppose that at least another protein, along with CR2, may be involved in setting up a cell surface complex able to receive and transduce the signal triggered by OKB7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our experimental system the protein that offers a third binding site to OKB7, may be represented by a 33 kDa protein bearing C3d determinants </plain></SENT>
