<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of myeloid antigens has been extensively examined using two-color analysis in 43 children with B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On pre-culture cells, CD33 expression was frequently observed in CD19+, CD10- B-precursor ALL, and CD14 was expressed only on the cells from B-precursor ALL expressing CD19, CD10 and CD20, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 2 or 3 days of culture without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, CD13 emerged on the cells from 21 of 29 patients irrespective of the presence or the absence of fetal calf serum in the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of four patients with CD10+ B-precursor ALL, which showed no expression of CD13 after culture, two had T-cell associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas the addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> to the culture enhanced the expression of CD13 on the cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> reduced the expression of this antigen on B-precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the regulatory mechanism of CD13 expression may be different between B-precursor ALL and ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-culture with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> mostly abrogated the induction of CD13, suggesting that CD13 expression was mainly dependent on de novo protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
