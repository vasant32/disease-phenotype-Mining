<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many cell lines are sensitive to growth at low cell density and undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> if the cell density is decreased below a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In stable transfection experiments this cell density-dependent growth may be the limiting factor, since during drug selection the cell density <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> below the critical threshold, precluding outgrowth of transfected clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a simple protocol for the establishment of stably transfected human B cell lines making use of the protective action of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol includes: (i) seeding the cells in medium supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50144">sodium pyruvate</z:chebi>, alpha-thioglycerol and bathocuproine disulfonate; (ii) delaying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dominant marker selection to improve recovery of the cells after electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stably transfected clones have thus been obtained from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, which have been regarded as untransfectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this protocol the stable transfection efficiency with episomal plasmids approaches the transient transfection efficiency, indicating that virtually every transfected cell can be established as a stably transfected clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protocol should also prove useful for other cell lines, e.g. neuronal cells, having similar sensitivities to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
