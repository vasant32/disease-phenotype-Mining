<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aberrant c-myc expression patterns occur in human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which consistently exhibit c-myc chromosomal translocations, mutations within and flanking the translocated allele, a loss of the block to transcription elongation in exon 1, and a promoter shift to use of the upstream P1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the mechanism responsible for the loss of transcription elongation blockage and resulting c-myc deregulation in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we analyzed transcription patterns after transfer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> c-myc alleles into murine cells and Xenopus oocyte germinal vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have determined that although the mutations within and surrounding several Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> c-myc alleles are not sufficient, in themselves, to abrogate the transcription elongation block, transcription initiation from the P2 promoter may be necessary to obtain the block to transcription elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test directly the role of c-myc promoters in programming transcription elongation blockage, we analyzed transcription patterns from in vitro mutagenized c-myc genes containing deletions of either the P1 or P2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that P1-initiated c-myc transcripts do not terminate at discrete sites near the 3' end of exon 1, whereas P2-initiated transcripts either terminate or read through the transcription block signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overexpression and/or constitutive expression from the c-myc P1 promoter may contribute to increased readthrough transcription in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and, hence, to aberrant expression patterns or levels of c-myc steady-state transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells to modulate c-myc P2-initiated transcription to either read through or to block elongation provides a fine control mechanism over c-myc steady-state <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
