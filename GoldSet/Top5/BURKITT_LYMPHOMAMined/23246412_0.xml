<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinicopathological features of 44 patients with aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> which were classified into 3 groups based on the World Health Organization 2008 classification as follows: including 30 cases of diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e>), 8 cases of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and 6 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (BCLU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male predominance was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and BCLU groups and the mean age varied from 29 years in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, 61 years in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and 70 years in BCLU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BCLU presented at more advanced stages and had a higher international prognostic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, they shared characteristics of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (including more frequent expression of SOX11) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH analyses showed three cases with more than one rearrangement: one MYC/BCL2 and two BCL2/BCL6, in addition to which one case with BCL2/IGH translocation and another with MYC rearrangement were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up survival time of BCLU was 6.6 months, which was significantly shorter in comparison to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> (31 months) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (30 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The importance of recognizing this BCLU group relies on its different clinical course, poor prognosis and shorter survival than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An accurate diagnosis is critical for risk stratification and to improve therapeutic approaches and outcomes </plain></SENT>
