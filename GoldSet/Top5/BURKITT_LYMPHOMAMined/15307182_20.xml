<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune recognition of EBNA1 by CD8+ T cells is prevented by an internal glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) which blocks proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test whether EBV-infected cells could be recognized by T helper cells, human CD4+ T cell clones specific for EBNA1 were isolated from latently EBV-infected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These T cells, however, failed to recognize EBV-positive target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether endogenous presentation of EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on MHC class II was prevented by the GAr domain, a mutant EBV strain with an EBNA1 lacking the GAr (EBNA1DeltaGA) was generated and used to establish an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid B cell line (LCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBNA1DeltaGA LCL were not recognized by the EBNA1-specific T cell clones either, indicating that the GAr domain does not mediate this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune recognition could be restored by overexpression of EBNA1, for which at least 60-fold higher levels of both EBNA1 or EBNA1DeltaGAr protein were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that EBNA1 evades direct recognition by CD4+ T helper cells, since its steady state level is below the threshold required for efficient presentation on MHC class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings have important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic approaches to target EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
