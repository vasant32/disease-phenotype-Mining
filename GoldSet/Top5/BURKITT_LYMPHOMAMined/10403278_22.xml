<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EBV DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of synovial tissue from 84 patients with RA and from 81 patients with non-RA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (controls) and was correlated with the patients' HLA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EBV DNA and EBV-encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> 1 transcripts were significantly more frequently present in synovial tissue from the RA patients (29 of 84) than in that from the non-RA patient controls (8 of 81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA-positive individuals had a 5.47 times higher risk of presenting with RA than did EBV DNA-negative individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In HLA-DRB1*0401,0404,0405,0408-positive or shared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-positive patients, the risk was further increased (odds ratio for EBV and HLA-DR4 approximately 41, for EBV and the shared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> approximately 15) compared with those who lacked both EBV DNA and RA-linked HLA genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EBV seems to function as an environmental risk factor for RA, particularly in patients with the RA-linked HLA-DRB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
