<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the development of IFN resistance is a significant drawback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using conditions that mimic in vivo selection of IFN-resistant cells, the RST2 IFN-resistant cell line was isolated from the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RST2 cell line was resistant to the antiviral, antiproliferative, and gene-induction actions of IFNalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although STAT2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was present, STAT2 protein expression was deficient in RST2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A variant STAT2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, which resulted from alternative splicing within the intron between exon 19 and 20, was expressed in several human cell lines but at relatively high levels in RST2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the RST2 line showed an intrinsic resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by a number of chemotherapeutic agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27656">camptothecin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of STAT2 in RST2 cells not only rescued their sensitivity to the biological activities of IFNs but also restored sensitivity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by these chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intrinsic resistance of the RST2 cells to IFN as well as chemotherapeutic agents adds a new dimension to our knowledge of the role of STAT2 as it relates to not only biological actions of IFN but also resistance to chemotherapy-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
