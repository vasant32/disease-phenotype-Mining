<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neoplastic cell lines used were HeLa (cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), MCF-7 (<z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp>), WI-38 CT-1 (embryonic lung fibroblasts transformed in culture by 60Co gamma-ray irradiation), KMM-1 (<z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>), and Raji (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cell line used was WI-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibitory effects were determined by measuring colony formation for HeLa, MCF-7, WI-38 CT-1, and WI-38 cells, and by measuring cell growth for KMM-1 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each cell line showed different sensitivities to 5-FU or interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of 5-FU and interferon showed synergistic inhibitory effects on the growth of HeLa, WI-38 CT-1, KMM-1, and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither synergistic nor additive growth inhibitory effects of the combination of 5-FU and interferon were observed in MCF-7 and WI-38 cells </plain></SENT>
