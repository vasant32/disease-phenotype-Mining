<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based expression vectors were tested for cytokine gene transfer-mediated induction of an immune response against human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These vectors express the EBV latent gene EBNA 1 and carry the EBV latent origin of replication (ori P) for episomal replication in transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 3 human immunoglobulin light chain enhancer elements augment expression in B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suitability of these vectors for expression of cytokine genes in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in vitro has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to extend these experiments in vivo, highly tumorigenic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells were transfected with different cytokine genes of human and murine origin cloned into the EBNA 1/ori P vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tumorigenicity of the transfectants was measured after inoculation into <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No effect on tumorigenicity was observed after hIL 6 transfection and an inconsistent effect after hTNFalpha transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, complete suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> outgrowth occurred in hIL 10 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressive effect, however, was restricted to the IL 10 transfectants themselves and not directed against non-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By comparison, mIL 4 transfected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells also were non-tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, co-inoculation of mIL 4 transfected and non transfected cells resulted in suppression of the tumorigenicity of the non-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, highly tumorigenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice are sensitive to immune effector mechanisms triggered by cytokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this experimental model, EBNA 1/ori P expression vectors are a suitable tool for cytokine gene transfer mediated induction of an anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> immune response of the host </plain></SENT>
