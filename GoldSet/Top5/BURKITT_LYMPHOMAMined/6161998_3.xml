<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At nanomolar concentrations, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> blocked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation into cellular DNA by more than 90% within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>-treated cells produced about 20-fold more interferon in response to Sendai virus than did untreated controls and simultaneous treatment with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> gave a further two- to three-fold enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither of these effects of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> was reversed on removal of the compound; furthermore, exposure of Namalwa cells to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> for only 1 h was sufficient for full activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4-O-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, a compound only marginally active as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> promoter, showed effects similar to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>, but only at concentrations 300-fold higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to its effects on Namalwa cells, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> did not affect synthesis of interferon in response to Sendai virus in two other Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines (Raji and Daudi) nor in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, BJAB; it inhibited interferon production in the human myeloid cell line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
