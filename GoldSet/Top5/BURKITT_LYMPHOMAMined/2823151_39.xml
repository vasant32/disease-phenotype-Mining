<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The corresponding c-myc proto-oncogene can contribute to the genesis and/or the progression of an equally wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> when activated by retroviral insertions, chromosomal translocations or gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene product is a DNA-binding, nuclear phosphoprotein that is involved in the control of cell proliferation and possibly in DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The replication of Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a useful model system to study eukaryotic DNA replication as the virus relies almost entirely on cellular DNA replication apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SV40-based vector, pSVEpR4, replicates poorly in the human BJAB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line and in most human cells, but replicates well in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, which have fused immunoglobulin and c-myc genes, resulting in high c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cotransfection of the BJAB cells with a c-myc-expressing construct (pI4-P6) increased the replication of pSVEpR4 tenfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that overexpression of the c-myc gene product allows the replication of SV40 in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, suggesting that c-myc is involved in the control of replication </plain></SENT>
