<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity was present at 4.08+/-0.74 U/108 cells in 23 morphologicall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples from childhood controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Terminal transferase was present at greater than 23 U/108 nucleated cells and at greater than31 U/108 blasts in the bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> studied at initial diagnosis and at disease relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was detectable at low levels, less than 7.5 U/108 cells, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remission marrow smaples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow terminal transferase activity was markedly elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients, whereas low levels which were difficult to interpret were present in the peripheral blood samples of two patients at diagnosis and six patients at relapse who had low absolute lymphoblast counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of greater variation in the lymphoblast content of peripheral blood, bone marrow assays are more reliable in detecting disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase values obtained during the active phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were significantly greater than those found in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, bone marrow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal transferase determinations in blast cells of two patients with leukemic conversion of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from one patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were within the control range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These dat further define the usefulness of terminal deoxynucleotidyltrnasferase assay in the differentiation and classication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
