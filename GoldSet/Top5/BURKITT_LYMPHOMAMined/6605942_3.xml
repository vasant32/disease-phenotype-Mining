<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the significance of karyotypic evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with an 8;14 translocation [t(8;14)(q24;q32)], we examined the clinicopathologic features and immunologic phenotypes of nine Japanese patients with various types of B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> with the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients had structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome No. I (Iq) in a stem line or the subline of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with a t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rearrangements were composed of a translocation involving Iq with other chromosomes and a tandem duplication of Iq, and they were exclusively associated with a partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> for Iq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells did not express surface immunoglobulins (s-Ig), had the Iq translocation in their highly complex karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells from the other seven patients expressed s-Ig and the karyotypes were relatively simple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, the Iq translocation was found in two patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and the Iq duplication were observed in a stem line or the sublines from four patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one each with small non-cleaved-cell or diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for one patient in the stage of IE, these patients had a poor prognosis because of the clinical conversion of extranodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the earlier disease phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are compatible with those of Western patients with a t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells marked primarily with a t(8;14) could have "major routes" in the karyotypic evolution, for which potentials should be recognized as clinical risk factors, and the morphologic presentation and the expression of surface immunoglobulins may be associated with the process of karyotypic evolution </plain></SENT>
