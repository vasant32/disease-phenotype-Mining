<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the respective roles of IL-10 and IL-12 in gamma delta T cell activation, using the selective expansion of V gamma 9 cells in Mtb- or Daudi-stimulated PBMC as a readout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-10 inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the V gamma 9 responsiveness to Mtb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-10 did not impair reactivity toward Daudi cells, even when added at 10 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory action of IL-10 could be overcome by the exogenous supply of IL-2 or IL-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blockade of endogenous IL-10 by neutralizing mAb increased responsiveness to Mtb but not to Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low concentrations of exogenous IL-12 increased the V gamma 9 responsiveness to Mtb in 6 of 11 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-12 inhibited V gamma 9 cell expansion in response to Daudi stimulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the tested individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutralizing anti-IL-12 Ab significantly suppressed V gamma 9 responsiveness to Mtb in IL-12 nonresponders but only slightly inhibited the latter responsiveness in IL-12 responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-IL-12 Ab correlated with the level of Mtb-stimulated endogenous IL-12 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In purified gamma delta T cells, IL-12 synergized with IL-2 to stimulate cellular expansion in response to Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This effect was reduced when T cell-depleted APC were added back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, neutralization of endogenous IFN-gamma by Ab abrogated V gamma 9 cell responsiveness to Mtb but exerted only a minor inhibition of the reactivity toward Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results reveal significant differences in the cytokine requirement of gamma delta T cell activation by Mtb or Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
