<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is mainly synthesized by the fetal liver and the yolk sac with minor contributions of several non-hepatic fetal tissues, variable according to the species considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most fetal cells, whatever their origin, possess the ability to bind and to endocytose the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This property, which is considered to be lost in differentiated cells of the adult, may be resumed in tumoral cells and is due to the expression of specific AFP receptors at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical and immunological approaches, combined with in situ hybridization, were used to investigate the specific uptake and synthesis of human AFP in several classes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in several malignant cell lines of hematopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the exception of quiescent T lymphocytes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells investigated specifically bound AFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant blood mononuclear cells expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts of AFP which were translated into the protein during a well established period of cellular growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an AFP/receptor autocrine system might operate in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its physiological role is discussed in relation to recent work from our laboratory--providing experimental evidence that AFP, throughout its interaction with specific cell receptors, regulates and facilitates the entry of fatty acids into living cells undergoing growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
