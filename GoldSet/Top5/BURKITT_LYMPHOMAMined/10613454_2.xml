<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 29 patients with LBL who received induction therapy with a CHOP-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (with a median age of 54.5 years) have a CR rate of 72% and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> free long-time survival of 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The International Prognostic Index was the most valuable prognostic factor for survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of four patients with LBL who received HDT and one of four patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who received HDT achieved long-term remission </plain></SENT>
