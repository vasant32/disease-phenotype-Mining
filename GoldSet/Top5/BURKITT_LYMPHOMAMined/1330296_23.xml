<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To analyze the region upstream of c-myc, a number of novel probes were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were generated by chromosomal walking starting from the breakpoint of the chromosomal translocation of the B-cell line 380 and by cloning the breakpoint of the translocation of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line IARC/BL72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the newly isolated probes a detailed physical map of 500 kilobases of the region upstream of c-myc was established applying pulsed-field gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomal breakpoint of IARC/BL72 cells was mapped to a site 55 kilobases 5' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region 20 kilobases in length and containing the breakpoints of 380, EW36, P3HR-1, and Daudi cells was identified 170-190 kilobases upstream of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition the HPV18 integration site in HeLa cells was located between 340 and 500 kilobases 5' of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probes were used to define the c-myc amplification units in Colo320-HSR and HL60 cells as well as in four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence is provided that the amplicon of HL60 cells is discontinuously organized </plain></SENT>
