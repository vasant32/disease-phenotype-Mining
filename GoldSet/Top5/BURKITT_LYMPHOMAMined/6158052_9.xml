<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The various subsets were incubated with interferon for 3 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cell lines that differ in sensitivity to the natural killer effect, K562 and Daudi, were exposed to these lymphocytes (i.e., their sensitivity to interferon-activated killing was tested.) Cell line Daudi, with a low sensitivity to the natural killer effect, was also affected by interferon-activated killing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of the nonadherent subsets, separated according to the expression E receptor, ranked similarly in natural killing (anti-K562) and interferon-activated killing (anti-K562 and anti-Daudi) in the following order: E receptor-negative cells, low-affinity E receptor-positive cells, and high-affinity E receptor-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further separation on the basis of Fc receptor expression revealed a difference between the two targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Fc receptor-positive and -negative cells that did not express high-affinity E receptors killed K562 with similar efficiency whereas Daudi cells were more sensitive to the effect of cells devoid of Fc receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results obtained with other targets suggested that T cell lines behave similarly to K562 and that the difference may be generally valid for T and B cell lines </plain></SENT>
