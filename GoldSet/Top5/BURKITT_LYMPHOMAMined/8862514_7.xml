<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We isolated a cDNA clone encoding the human <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG) E receptor EP4 subtype and examined the gene expression in human blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis revealed that the EP4 gene is expressed at a high level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and at lower levels in cultured human blood cell lines, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 and U937 (monocytoid cell lines), MOLT-4 and Jurkat (T-cell lines), and Raji (B-cell line) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine regulation of the EP4 gene expression in the immune system, we studied the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> 13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) on these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was upregulated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, U937, and Raji cells by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, and was downregulated in MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> were further analyzed, and the upregulation of the EP4 gene was shown to be followed by an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> binding sites and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>-induced cAMP accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the striking contrast, other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi> receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2 and EP3) and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi> receptors (IP and DP) were shown not to be upregulated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this is the first demonstration of a highly specific upregulation of the EP4 subtype in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, suggesting the importance of the EP4 subtype in the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study we also clarified that EP4 gene expression is regulated differently among human monocytoid and lymphoid lineage cells, thus leading to the better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for the human EP4 gene expression in the immune system </plain></SENT>
