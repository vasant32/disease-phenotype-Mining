<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathologic features of EBVaGC are male predominance, occurrence primarily in the proximal stomach, multiplicity, moderately or poorly differentiated histological type, and association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Virologically, EBV in EBVaGC is monoclonal or oligoclonal in the intramucosal or early invasive stage, and invariably monoclonal in advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Latency type of gene expression in EBV is the same as that in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (latency type I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBVaGC is a unique type of gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, which is derived from a single or a few EBV-infected epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there are still some unanswered questions, such as the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> of epithelial cells, the primary target in the gastric epithelium, the molecular events underlying EBVaGC, and the interaction of EBV with cytokine genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, as well as the predisposing factors for EBVaGC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To develop an experimental model, we recently established a transplantable EBVaGC - in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice - which retains the original EBV and the same pattern of latency gene expression as the original <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of a new therapeutic approach using this model, such as a gene therapy specific to EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, will make EBVaGC not only a pathologically but also a clinically distinct gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> entity </plain></SENT>
