<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new two-step high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure has been developed to separate modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H1 subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reversed-phase (RP) HPLC followed by hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was used for analytical and semi-preparative scale fractionation of multi-phosphorylated H1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> subtypes into their non-phosphorylated and distinct phosphorylated forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HILIC system utilizes the weak <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-exchange column PolyCAT A and an increasing <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> gradient in a methanephosphonic acid-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35026">triethylamine</z:chebi> buffer (pH 3.0) in the presence of 70% (v/v) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identity and purity of the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> subfractions obtained was assayed by capillary electrophoretic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that application of the combined RP-HPLC-HILIC procedure to the analysis and isolation of modified H1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> subtypes provides an innovative and important alternative to traditional separation techniques that will be extremely useful in studying the biological function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
