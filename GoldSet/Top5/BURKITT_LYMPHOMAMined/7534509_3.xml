<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using various approaches we received evidence that, in Namalva-S cells carrying a t(8;14) translocation and highly expressing c-myc, the two alleles of the gene are spatially and structurally segregated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spatial segregation of the alleles was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nuclei analyzed by in situ hybridization technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their structural segregation, i.e., association with different intranuclear structures, was confirmed in a number of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When high-salt extracted nuclei were digested with EcoRI, which is known to produce fragments containing the entire c-myc locus, the sequences of the gene were found separated between the pellet, containing sequences firmly associated with the heavier matrix structures, and the supernatant, containing sequences from the free length of the DNA loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern hybridization performed with a probe representative for the constant region of the human IgH locus revealed that this fractionation in fact segregates the reorganized from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allele of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Run-on experiments carried out with two fractions, topologically equivalent to the above P and S but isolated as intact chromatin structures, indicated that the allele associated with nuclear matrix is actively transcribed, while that located in the free length of the chromatin loops is practically nontranscribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies on the chromatin organization of transcribed and nontranscribed alleles revealed the existence in them of two alternative chromatin structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control experiments with beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene, performed with cells constitutively nontranscribing or actively transcribing this gene, confirmed our conclusions about the spatial segregation of the two alleles and clarified that their structural segregation occurs when the gene is activated for transcription </plain></SENT>
