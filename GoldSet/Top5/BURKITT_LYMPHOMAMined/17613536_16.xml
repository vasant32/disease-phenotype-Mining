<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although gain of 1q occurs in 25% of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>) and 10% of pediatric high hyperdiploid <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALLs), little is known about the origin, molecular genetic characteristics and functional outcome of dup(1q) in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten dup(1q)-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e>/ALLs were investigated by tiling resolution (32k) array CGH analysis, which revealed that the proximal breakpoints in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were near-centromeric, in eight of them clustering within a 1.4 Mb segment in 1q12-21.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1q distal breakpoints were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, being more distal in the ALLs than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimally gained segments in the ALLs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> were 57.4 Mb [dup(1)(q22q32.3)] and 35 Mb [dup(1)(q12q25.2)], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Satellite II DNA on 1q was not hypomethylated, as ascertained by Southern blot analyses of 15 BLs/ALLs with and without gain of 1q, indicating that aberrant methylation was not involved in the origin of dup(1q), as previously suggested for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with 1q rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global gene expression analyses revealed that five genes in the minimally 57.4 Mb gained region--B4GALT3, DAP3, RGS16, TMEM183A and UCK2--were significantly overexpressed in dup(1q)-positive ALLs compared with high hyperdiploid ALLs without dup(1q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DAP3 and UCK2 genes were among the most overexpressed genes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> case with gain of 1q investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DAP3 protein has been reported to be highly expressed in invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme cells, whereas expression of the UCK2 protein has been correlated with sensitivity to anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, involvement of these genes in dup(1q)-positive ALLs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> has previously not been reported </plain></SENT>
