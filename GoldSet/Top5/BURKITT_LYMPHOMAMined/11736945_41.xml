<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR) for ALL linked to MTHFR C677T was 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8); for heterozygotes it was 0.5 (95% CI 0.2-0.9) and for homozygotes it was 0.3 (95%CI 0.09-0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MTHFR A1298C yielded an overall OR for ALL of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.7-2.6); for heterozygotes it was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.7-7.6) and for homozygotes it was 2.8 (95% CI 0.5-15.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MTHFR C677T was linked to a significant 2.4-fold decreased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e>, whereas MTHFR A1298C did not significantly affect the risk of ALL in our population </plain></SENT>
