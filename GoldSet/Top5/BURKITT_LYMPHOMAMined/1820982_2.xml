<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF beta is also an inhibitor of the proliferation and functional activities of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T and B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate its effect on the growth of a human leukemic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested its activity on the doubling time, the DNA synthesis rate and the clonal growth of a panel of lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the myeloid cell lines, the proliferation in liquid cultures as well as the clonal growth of KG1, HL60 and U937 were suppressed by TGF beta 1 at doses ranging from 0.025 to 2.5 ng/ml; the degree of inhibition was, however, variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BV 137, a Ph1-positive cell line derived from a very undifferentiated stem cell, was also highly responsive to TGF beta 1 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the six lymphoid neoplastic cell lines, only Nalm 6, a pre-B leukemic cell line, was consistently and reproducibly inhibited by the same doses of TGF beta 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, Raji and Daudi, and three T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (Molt 4, Jurkat and PF 382) were insensitive to TGF beta inhibition </plain></SENT>
