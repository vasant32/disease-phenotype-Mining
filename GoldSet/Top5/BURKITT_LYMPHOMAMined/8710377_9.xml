<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Shc/Grb2 complex may be involved in Ras activation, since Grb2 interacts with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factor Sos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reveal here an additional complexity of the BCR-induced Shc/Grb2 complex: it contains tyrosine phosphorylated proteins of 130, 110 and 75 kDa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 130 kDa molecule inducibly associates with Shc, while the 75 kDa protein interacts with the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 110 kDa molecule is defined as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>, the product of the c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">cbl</z:chebi> oncogene, which is strongly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon BCR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> constitutively interacts with the SH3 domains of Grb2, with a preference for the amino-terminal domain, and is in this way recruited to Shc upon BCR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunodepletion studies showed that Grb2-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> can be phosphorylated by BCR-induced tyrosine kinases independent of a Shc/Grb2 interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the BCR can also couple to a Grb2 complex without the involvement of Shc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> not only interacts with Grb2, but also with the adaptor protein Crk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to its constitutive interaction with Grb2, tyrosine-phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> only associates with Crk after BCR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, we observe that the BCR activates Shc/Grb2-, Grb2- and Crk adaptor complexes of distinct composition, which may allow selective coupling to different signal transduction cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> participates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three adaptor complexes and is tyrosine phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation, pointing to a central role for this molecule in the regulation of antigen receptor-induced B cell responses </plain></SENT>
