<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of increased EBV load in the peripheral blood acts as a surrogate marker for increased risk of PTLD development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the time course of the disease, its severity, the organs involved, and mortality rates in our institutional experience of pediatric heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper identifies risk factors for PTLD and describes the different ways of diagnosing and treating the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTLD was screened for in 146 pediatric heart transplant patients using a retrospective analysis in patients who received transplantation before 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospective determination was performed in 72/146 patients transplanted after 1998 within the post-transplant follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of PTLD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> interventions, including tapering of immunosuppression, surgery, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> monitoring, and antiviral interventions, was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PTLD was diagnosed in 12/147 (8.2%) children at a mean age of 7.2 +/- 3.3 yr after a mean post-transplant period of 3.2 +/- 2.2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PTLD manifested in: lymph nodes (n = 4), intestine (n = 3), tonsils and adenoids (n = 2), eye (n = 2), and lung (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was diagnosed in 7/12 as a monomorphic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in four patients as a monomorphic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a polymorphic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a T-cell rich or angiocentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Liebow) and as reactive plasmacytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (early lesion), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histology was not possible in one patient with ocular manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBV association was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risk factors in the comparison with patients without PTLD were age at time of Tx, primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> after Tx, use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">Azathioprine</z:chebi> and &gt;or=3 doses of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CMV mismatch and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>, rejection episodes and steroids were not risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite reduction of immunosuppression, treatment consisted of surgical procedures to remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> masses (n = 6), Rituximab (n = 5), polychemotherapy (n = 3), antiviral (n = 1) and autologous T-cell therapy (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated full remission without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to PTLD or treatment at 3.9 (1.3-6.2) yr median follow-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The manifestation of PTLD in pediatric heart transplant recipients is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and is predominantly in the form of a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A tight and specific follow-up including early assessment of immunity status and specific therapeutic intervention to improve cellular immunity is warranted and may contribute to a significant reduction of PTLD-related morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
