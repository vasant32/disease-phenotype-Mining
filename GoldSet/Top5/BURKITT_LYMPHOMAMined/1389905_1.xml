<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NK and LAK activity against K562 cells was not enhanced by their treatment with OK432 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the susceptibility of OK432-treated Daudi and KATO-III cells to lysis by LAK cells was enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Succinate dehydrogenase activity and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis were impaired in Daudi and KATO-III cells by treatment with OK432, and moreover the expression of HLA Class I antigen and beta 2-microglobulin was inhibited in OK432-treated KATO-III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is suggested that the enhancement of the susceptibility of OK432-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells with regard to succinate dehydrogenase activity, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis, and HLA Class I antigen expression </plain></SENT>
