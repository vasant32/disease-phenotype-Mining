<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, novel therapeutic approaches are being investigated wherein lytic replication of the virus is induced prior to the use of cytotoxic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36044">antiviral drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of suitable agents to induce lytic replication has been a critical step in this novel approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> derivatives induce a lytic pattern of EBV gene expression in patient-derived EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines and, together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>, effectively reduce or eliminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">Butyrate</z:chebi> has drawbacks as a therapeutic agent, however, as constant intravenous infusion is required to achieve detectable plasma levels of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether discontinuous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> is capable of initiating lytic phase gene expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase induction, and sensitizing EBV-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>-mediated cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that multiple daily 6-h exposures of the EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line P3HR1 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> induced sustained expression of the EBV lytic phase protein BMRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase was also induced by intermittent exposure, although to a lower level than with continuous exposure treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, discontinuous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> induced a similar level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell growth inhibition as did continuous treatment, as measured by serial enumeration of viable cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> cell proliferation assays and measurement of cellular DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that those cells which survived initial exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> remained susceptible to further cycles of combination treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggests that continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> may not be necessary for maintaining <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase gene expression and sensitization to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agents</z:chebi> in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and that therapeutic regimens which employ more convenient, discontinuous exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi> may also be effective clinically </plain></SENT>
