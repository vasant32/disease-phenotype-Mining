<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the incidence and prevalence of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> increasing, a comparison of survival patterns by subtype may provide critical clues for improving the disease burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a comprehensive survival analysis for 254,702 lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> cases diagnosed during 1973-2003 at 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification introduced in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The best survival was observed for Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> among young patients, and the worst survival was observed among cases with plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, particularly plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Being diagnosed at a lower stage without B-symptoms and a non-HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> status favored survival for each type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males typically had lower survival rates than females, but the opposite was observed for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among non-whites and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> among non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-Hispanic whites typically had higher survival rates than blacks with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival rates decline with age at diagnosis among elders, while the patterns were diverse by subtype among younger cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> survival patterns suggest that distinct prognostic risk factors impact survival by subtype and that future research and public health interventions should address racial disparities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> survivorship </plain></SENT>
