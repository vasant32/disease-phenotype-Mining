<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study prospectively evaluated and compared the outcome and toxicity of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-positive and HIV-negative patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> who were treated in an intensive immunochemotherapy-based and age-adapted trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 118 adult patients (80 HIV-negative and 38 HIV-positive) aged 15 to 83 years were treated with 4 (nonbulky stages I-II) or 6 (stages II bulky, III-IV) cycles of intensive chemotherapy combined with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction in chemotherapy doses and modification of the cycle schedules was performed in patients older than 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of HIV-positive patients were comparable with those who were HIV-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete remission rates were 82% and 87%, respectively, and 9 patients died in induction, 9 died in remission, and 7 relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, nonsignificant differences were observed in the 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) probabilities (77% and 63% for HIV-positive and 80% and 78% for HIV-negative patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Young HIV-infected patients presented higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis and severe infectious episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor general status and bone marrow involvement, but not advanced age, were associated with a shorter OS, allowing the definition of 3 prognostic groups, with the OS ranging from 50% to 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age-adapted intensive immunochemotherapy is highly effective in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, with a higher toxicity in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Poor general status and bone marrow involvement had a negative impact on survival </plain></SENT>
