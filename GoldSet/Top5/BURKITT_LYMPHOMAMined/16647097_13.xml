<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pim kinases are proto-oncogenes that are upregulated in a number of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) associated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have also been shown to be upregulated in Kaposi <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus (KSHV) infected primary B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cells in KSHV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are latently infected and express only a small subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes, with KSHV latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) being constitutively expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LANA regulates the transcription of a large number of cellular and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that LANA upregulates transcription from the Pim-1 promoter (pPim-1) and map this activation to a region in the promoter located within the sequence (-681 to +37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that LANA expressing cells can proliferate faster and are better protected from drug induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since transition through cell cycle check points and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> are functions associated with Pim-1, it is likely that higher Pim-1 expression in cells expressing LANA is responsible, at least in part, for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Pim-1 phosphorylation site was also identified within the amino-terminal domain of LANA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro kinase assays, we confirmed that LANA was indeed a Pim-1 substrate, and the failure of Pim-1 to phosphorylate LANA mutated at SS205/6RR identified this site as the specific serine residues phosphorylated by Pim-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This report provides valuable insight into yet another cellular signaling pathway subverted by KSHV LANA and suggests a contribution to KSHV related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
