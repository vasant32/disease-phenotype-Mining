<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cell lines the Ck-gene is found in juxtaposition to the c-myc gene on the 8q+ chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The location of the c-myc gene 5' of an immunoglobulin constant gene appears to be a general feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 2p chromosome the site of the breakpoint of the translocation is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 64 the break is in the fragment carrying Jk sequences and in cell line JI it is between Jk and Vk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 64 different marker chromosomes were observed which result from breakage near or within the JGK-gene cluster on chromosome 2p </plain></SENT>
