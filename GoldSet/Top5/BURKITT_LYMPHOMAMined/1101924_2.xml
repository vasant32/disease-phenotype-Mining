<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathological features of 64 children with non-Hodgkin's malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> seen between April 1962 and June 1973 are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-one children had diffuse, undifferentiated, non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They tended to be boys under 10 years of age and their median survival was 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost one-third are surviving for 1-11 years, most in initial complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen children had diffuse, poorly differentiated, histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They tended to be boys more than 10 years of age, their median survival was only 6 months, and only the 3 patients with Stage I peripheral node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two children had nodular, lymphocytic, poorly differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> resembling the Burkitt type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From our clinical and pathological observations, we conclude that non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomata in children cannot be separated from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic, histiocytic and unclassified <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> by cytological or histological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>What is called diffuse, undifferentiated, non-Burkitt type, or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is actually <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> without apparent invasion of marrow and peripheral blood by neoplastic lymphocytes at time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>What is termed diffuse, histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> histiocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> without apparent infiltration of marrow and peripheral blood at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One could say just as well that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is Stage IV lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> histiocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> is Stage IV histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further classification of lymphocytic and histiocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> by newer functional, chemical and morphological methods should include both what is called lymphocytic or histiocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and what is called non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> as one group of diseases, susceptible to subclassification by the new methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We recommend that Stage I lymphocytic and histiocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> be treated with local irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with Stages II-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> should receive anti-leukaemic forms of therapy including prolonged multiple agent chemotherapy and preventive central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Staging laparotomy should be considered in patients with Stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> in low cervical, axillary and inguinal nodes </plain></SENT>
