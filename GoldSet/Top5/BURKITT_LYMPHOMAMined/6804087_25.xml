<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> specimens stained for a single immunoglobulin light chain indicating a monoclonal B-cell lymphoid proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Striking <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> green pyronine and punctate Oil-Red O staining were demonstrated in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic and cytologic examination demonstrated a lymphoid proliferation with a high mitotic count, a "starry-sky" pattern, prominent cytoplasmic basophilia and vacuolation in both subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AMB cases showed a predominance of regular nuclei with 3-5 basophilic nucleoli, while the NB cases showed slightly greater nuclear variability with a greater proportion of nuclei containing 1-2 eosinophilic nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AMB patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children (median, 12 age years) and those with NB were adults (median, age 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The site of presentation in both groups was predominantly extranodal and abdominal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report emphasizes the considerable immunologic, morphologic, cytochemical and clinical overlap present among the subtypes of "undifferentiated" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
