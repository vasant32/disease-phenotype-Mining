<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, circulating antibodies to p53 are seen in about a third of cases with a p53 mutation, but are absent in cases without p53 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore detection of those antibodies has relatively low sensitivity but high specificity in the detection of p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We looked for circulating p53 antibodies by ELISA in 56 adult non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and 80 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A certain or highly probable p53 mutation was found by SSCP analysis, immunocyto- or immunohistochemistry in 8/35 (23%) NHL cases and 2/19 (10%) MM cases analysed by these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 80 MM cases and only one of the 56 cases of NHL had circulating p53 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive case had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a p53 missense mutation at codon 273 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, very few MM and NHL patients with a p53 mutation develop p53 antibodies and this test does not appear to be useful in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
