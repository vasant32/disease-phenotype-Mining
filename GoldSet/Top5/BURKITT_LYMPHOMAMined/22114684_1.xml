<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FR sequences are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> among EBV strains, and they are sometimes subject to partial deletion when subcloned in E. coli-based cloning vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the FR stability in EBV-BAC (<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome) system has never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the full length FR of the Akata strain EBV was not stably maintained in a BAC vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, newly obtained BAC clones of the B95-8 strain of EBV stably maintained the full length FR during recombinant virus production and B-cell transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Investigation of primary DNA sequences of Akata-derived EBV-BAC clones indicates that the FR instability is most likely due to a putative secondary structure of the FR region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the FR instability in EBV-BAC clones can be a pitfall in E. coli-mediated EBV genetics </plain></SENT>
