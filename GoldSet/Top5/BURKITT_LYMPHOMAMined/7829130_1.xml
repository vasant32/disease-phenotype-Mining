<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>mAb UN2 recognized an antigen expressed by a subpopulation of human thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In thymus, mAb UN2 recognized cortical cells; its expression was higher on CD3bright than on CD3dim thymocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antigen was also detected on peripheral blood granulocytes, monocytes, platelets and on cell lines MOLT4, U937 and KG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>mAb UN2 was submitted to the 5th International Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens, Boston, MA, 1993, and was assigned to the CD31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the UN2-recognized antigen in malignant lymphoid cells from 57 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> and 4 of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was analysed in flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 57 cases of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> studied, 49 were classified as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These showed high (86 +/- 8%) UN2 antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases of hairy-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> the percentage of cells reacting with mAb UN2 was 42 +/- 4%; the fluorescence intensity of labelled cells was lower than that displayed by cells of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> and comparable to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>mAb UN2 could prove useful in analysis of the lymphoid development and diagnostics of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
