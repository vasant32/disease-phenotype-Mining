<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both Epstein-Barr virus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> have been implicated as possible factors in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this implication a cross-sectional serological survey of an urban and a rural population in Ghana was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Malaria</z:e> was more prevalent in the rural areas, but there was no difference in antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) antibody titres between urban and rural dwellers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation between anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> antibody titres and anti-VCA antibody titres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> does not seem to influence immunological response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e>, as measured by anti-VCA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> are important in the aetiology of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, they produce their effects independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survey also showed that those in rural areas seroconverted earlier than those in urban areas, and that antibody levels were consistently higher in females than in males in every age-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case-control studies and screening programmes involving anti-VCA levels will therefore have to take these two findings into account </plain></SENT>
