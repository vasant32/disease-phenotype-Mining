<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines had C3b acceptors on their membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding of C3b was visualized by the detection of this protein on the cell surface with fluoresceinated anti-C3c serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The involvement of proteases in the activation of C3 was demonstrated: complement-membrane fluorescence occurred in the presence of EDTA but was completely abolished with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16586">epsilon-aminocaproic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments performed with purified C3 led to the conclusion that the protease activity might be the initial event for the activation of the alternative pathway by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
