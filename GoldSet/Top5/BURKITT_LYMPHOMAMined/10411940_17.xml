<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was recently reported that the p53-independent elevation of p21 protein levels is essential in mediating the G(1) arrest resulting from signal transduction events initiated by the crosslinking of membrane IgM on Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the role of p21 in cell cycle regulation is well documented, there is little information concerning its role in antibody-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the involvement of p21 in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by suppressing its induction in anti-IgM-treated Daudi cells through a p21 antisense expression construct approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction in induced p21 protein levels resulted in diminished G(1) arrest and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased susceptibility to anti-IgM-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was associated with increased caspase-3-like activity and poly-(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase cleavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that p21 may directly interfere with the caspase cascade, thus playing a dual role in regulating both cell cycle progression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
