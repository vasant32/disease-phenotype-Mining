<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has shown good results in preclinical and clinical trials even in patients that are non-responsive to standard chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To make RIT more effective, agents such as paclitaxel (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi>), that can enhance radiation effects, are being tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>Nude</z:mp> mice bearing human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji) xenografts were treated with: 1) 150 or 200 microCi (5.5 or 7.3 MBq) of 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1 alone, 2) 600 micrograms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> alone, 3) 150 or 200 microCi of 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1 plus 600 micrograms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> given 24 hours after RIT, or 4) no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size, survival, mouse weight and blood counts were monitored to assess efficacy and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival for mice treated in this 84 day trial was: 71% for 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1 (200 microCi) plus <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi>, 29% for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> alone, 6% for 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1 (200 microCi) alone and 14% in the untreated group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with 150 microCi had less toxicity than those treated with 200 microCi of 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1, however, the higher radiation dose, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi>, were required for improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mouse weights and myelotoxicity in the combined modality (RIT plus <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi>) groups were similar to those receiving the same dose of RIT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the Raji tumored <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse model, addition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">Taxol</z:chebi> to 90Y-2IT-BAD-Lym-1, in doses clinically achievable in humans, provided therapeutic synergy without increased or excessive toxicity </plain></SENT>
