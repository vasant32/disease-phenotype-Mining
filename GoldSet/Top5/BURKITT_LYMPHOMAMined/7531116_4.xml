<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The original human NK-like line YT was reported to lyse K562 and several B- and T-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The YT subline we are investigating, YT-INDY, does not lyse K562 or the T-cell line Molt-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It does, however, lyse the EBV+ Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) B-cell line Raji and EBV-immortalized B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several EBV- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines and an EBV- pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line that we tested were not appreciably lysed by YT-INDY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine if EBV plays a role in TC susceptibility to lysis by YT-INDY, we compared YT-INDY's ability to lyse the EBV- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line BL41 to its ability to lyse an EBV-infected derivative of BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBV-infected cell line was lysed, on average, at twice the level of the uninfected line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD28/B7 interactions appeared to be involved in TC recognition by YT-INDY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the level of expression of B7 molecules on the infected and uninfected BL41 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An average of 15% of the uninfected BL41 cells expressed B7-1/B7-3, compared to 79% of the infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>B7-2 expression was similar in the two cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lysis of EBV-infected BL41 was reduced by anti-B7-1/B7-3 (BB1) or anti-CD28 antibodies (Abs) to the level of lysis of the uninfected line, indicating that upregulation of B7-1/B7-3 by the virus may be responsible for the enhanced susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We attempted to determine the particular EBV latent protein responsible for B7-1/B7-3 upregulation by analyzing BL41 clones expressing LMP1, EBNA-2/EBNA-LP, or EBNA-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the high-expressing clones showed a higher level of B7-1/B7-3 expression than the vector-transfected control cell line, with LMP1-expressing clones expressing the highest amount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EBNA-1 clones and a high-expressing EBNA-2/EBNA-LP clone had a slightly higher density of B7-2 on their surface than the remaining clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of molecules of the B7 family correlated with increased susceptibility of the clones to lysis by YT-INDY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD28 or a combination of anti-B7-1/B7-3 and anti-By-2 did not inhibit lysis of the clones to the level of lysis of the vector-transfected control cell line in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intact EBV enhances susceptibility to YT-INDY lysis by upregulating B7-1/B7-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>EBV proteins expressed individually also enhance susceptibility to lysis and upregulate members of the B7 family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
