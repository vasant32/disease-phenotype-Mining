<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this second product the regions flanking the VK and JK segments in the germline are joined in a head to head fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now analysed f fragments in the human lymphoid cell lines Daudi, JI and IARC/BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three f fragments contain JK1 flanks; the VK derived moiety of f Daudi and f41 could be traced back to known germline VK genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a precise head to head joining of the heptanucleotide signal sequences in f Daudi and fJI while in f41 six <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> are present between the signal sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the VK-JK recombination products, the f fragments were found to lack <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The structures of the f fragments are discussed in the context of the VK-JK rearrangement mechanism </plain></SENT>
