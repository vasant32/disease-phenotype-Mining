<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to investigate the specificity of this reagent for B-lineage cases and its reactivity on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> that coexpress myeloid and B-cell antigens (biphenotypic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority (89%) of 72 B-cell precursor ALL patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, mb-1 was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 patients with early-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (CD10-, c mu-), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B-ALL</z:e> (c <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) and in the single case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (smIgM+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common-ALL</z:e> (CD10+, c <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30214">mu+</z:chebi>) were also positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 T-lineage ALL patients and 72 (93.5%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients examined were mb-1 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the 5 mb-1-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients were considered biphenotypic and expressed other B-cell antigens such as CD10, CD19, and/or cCD22 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases, mb-1 and cCD22 were more useful than other B-cell antigens in detecting biphenotypic cases, and mb-1 showed the highest correlation with the clonal rearrangement of Ig heavy chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that mb-1 is a sensitive and specific reagent for B-lineage blasts that will aid in the classification of B-cell precursor ALL and in the identification of biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> presenting as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
