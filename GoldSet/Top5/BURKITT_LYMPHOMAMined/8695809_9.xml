<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At presentation, bone marrow specimens from over 25% of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) display more than two clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes in Southern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis has shown predominantly different V(H)DJ(H) junctions among these genes, leading to the frequent description of such cases as oligoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have analyzed the lgH genes from four patients whose leukemic cells contained different patterns of lgH gene rearrangements between presentation and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide sequence analysis of the lgH genes showed that three mechanisms could account for these differences: de novo V(H)DJ(H) rearrangement, V(H) to DJ(H) recombination, and V(H) replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, more than two totally different V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements appeared during evolution of the disease, formally consistent with the conclusion that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were composed of apparently unrelated clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the retention of some of the antigen receptor gene rearrangements, as well as the persistence of a chromosomal marker in two cases, indicated that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> had a monoclonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that some ALLs arise from a lymphoid progenitor cell at a stage of lymphocyte development before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IgH gene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These leukemic lymphocyte progenitors generate malignant daughter cells capable of an in vivo maturation that involves the completion of multiple different lgH rearrangements as well as the modification of preexisting rearrangements by V(H) to DJ(H) recombination or by a V(H) replacement </plain></SENT>
