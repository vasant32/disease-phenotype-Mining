<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis due to deregulated expression of chromosome passenger proteins may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to our knowledge this is the first study investigating immunohistochemical expression of INCENP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to characterize the expression of INCENP in cases of non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, to compare the immunoreactivity between low and high grades and to evaluate the correlation between INCENP and MIB-1 labeling indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined INCENP and MIB-1 immunoreactivity in paraffin sections of 55 samples of non-Hodgkin B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, obtained from 55 patients, 31 men and 24 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty were of high grade and 25 were of low grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed significantly higher nuclear immunohistochemical expression of INCENP in high grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> versus low grade ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also INCENP expression was significantly correlated with MIB-1 labeling index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together our results point to a possible association between increased INCENP immunostaining and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> and also stress the need for further investigating the expression of INCENP and other mitotic regulatory proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and other malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
