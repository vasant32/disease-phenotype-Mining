<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using older classification systems, the 33 unclassifiable, aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> most closely resembled Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=24) or atypical Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with BCL2 expression (n=9) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adequate follow-up was available for 57 patients: 26 died and 31 were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the 52 patients with MYC/BCL2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the median overall survival was 18.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with antecedent/concurrent follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had median overall survival of 7.8 months </plain></SENT>
