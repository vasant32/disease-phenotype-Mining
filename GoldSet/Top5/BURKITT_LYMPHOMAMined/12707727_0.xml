<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of peripheral blood demonstrated WBC 6.2 x 10(9)/l with 45.5% blasts at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic blasts with positive peroxidase stain, but negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff stain comprised 91.6% on bone marrow specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface marker analysis of these blasts showed the following: CD3(-), CD5(-), CD7(-), CD10(+), CD19(+), CD13(+), CD14(-), CD33(+), CD34(+), CD41a(-), and CD56(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, he was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mixed lineage (myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He achieved complete remission (CR) by lymphoid-oriented chemotherapy performed after ineffective myeloid-oriented therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After four courses of consolidation chemotherapy for lymphoid lineage blasts, recurrence due to proliferation of myeloblasts had occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a second CR was obtained by low dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (AraC) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As this patient was considered to have a high risk of relapse, we selected allogeneic BMT from URD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) occurred probably due to altered pharmacokinetics usually observed in DS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Though <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) of systemic skin (grade II) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> due to the post-conditioning regimen, he could be discharged from our hospital on the 135th day after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On day 205 post-BMT, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> (BO) occurred as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and FK506, he died on day 400 post-BMT because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> due to BO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In DS patients, superfluous toxicities due to MTX and AraC treatment have been reported, and these toxicities have been considered due to altered pharmacokinetics in patients with DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This patient could tolerate the transplant conditioning regimen commonly used in patients without DS </plain></SENT>
