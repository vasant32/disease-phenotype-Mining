<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous study on several independently established Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-converted sublines of the EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) line BL41, we found that expression of the virally encoded membrane protein LMP1 was accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> clonability and tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate whether LMP1 can induce these phenotypic changes by itself, we have now studied the growth in suspension culture, the clonability in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> and the tumorigenicity in immunosuppressed and <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice of 4 LMP1-transfected sublines of BL41 that carry the gene under the control of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">ZnSO4</z:chebi>-inducible metallothionein promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of LMP1 at levels comparable to those detected in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) correlated with impairment of growth in suspension and reduction of clonability and tumorigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only minor changes were observed in transfectants expressing low LMP1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of LMP1 by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35176">ZnSO4</z:chebi> treatment of the low LMP1 clone MTLM5 was accompanied by a slowing down of proliferation, increased cell clumping and decreased clonability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that expression of LMP1 at levels which are compatible with immortalization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cells antagonizes the ability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to grow in vitro and in vivo, and illustrate a possible mechanism by which down-regulation of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigen may favor tumorigenicity in EBV-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
