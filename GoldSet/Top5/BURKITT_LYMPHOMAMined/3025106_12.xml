<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The expression of receptors for proliferation and differentiation factors was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence on 29 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines previously classified into 3 groups on the basis of their reactivity with 8 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), including anti-CALLA, BL13 and TU1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BL13 and HB5 antibodies recognize different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the EBV/CR2 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The determinant recognized by BL13 has been previously shown to be expressed only on cell lines of the first two groups, supposed to derive from the germinal center and to be negative on a third group of lines of putative BM origin and established from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, and as expected from its reactivity on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells in the BM or in the lymph nodes, HB5 antibody reacts with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The receptor for transferrin is expressed on the 29 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two new MAbs, Bac-1 and B1H5, could recognize respectively receptors for BCGF1 and BCGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bac-1 reacts with 15 of 17 BL lines belonging to the first two groups and 7 of 12 BL lines of the third group; 14 of 15 EBV + lines express Bac-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line expresses B1H5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IL2 receptor is weakly expressed on 5 EBV + cell lines and one EBV (-) line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> delta are BCGF1-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The almost constant expression of BCGF1 receptor on EBV + cell lines is the only strict relation between the expression of receptors for growth factors and their characteristics (i.e. EBV association, translocation, ethnic origin and clinical presentation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The maturation stage or the origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines in relation to the expression of growth factor receptors and the functional significance of these receptors will be discussed </plain></SENT>
