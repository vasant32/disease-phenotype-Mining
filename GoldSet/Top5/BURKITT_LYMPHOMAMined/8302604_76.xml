<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified two in vivo phosphorylation sites, Thr58 and Ser62, within a domain highly conserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Myc family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thr58 is mutated in several <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> forms of the protein and constitutes a mutational hot-spot in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Members of the GSK-3 and MAP kinase families, but not CKII, specifically phosphorylated these sites in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of these phosphorylation sites on Myc function was assessed by cotransformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts with Ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis of Thr58 to alanine potentiated focus formation, whereas substitution of Ser62 severely inhibited transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation of both residues restored <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, post-translational modulation of Myc via phosphorylation of a conserved region previously implicated in transactivation, transformation and autorepression </plain></SENT>
