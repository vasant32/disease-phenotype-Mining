<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of the recent finding that interleukin-5 (IL-5) is produced by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes (EBV-B cells), we performed studies to ascertain whether EBV-B cells might use IL-5 by an autocrine mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-B cells known to be IL-5 producers were capable of responding to addition of exogenous IL-5 by dose-related augmented proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of a neutralizing anti-IL-5 antibody reduced these effects and also dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp> of unsupplemented EBV-B cells, having a maximum effect at about 120 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no stimulatory effect of IL-5 was noted on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, nor were these lines growth-inhibited by anti-IL-5 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With biotinylated IL-5, (b-IL-5) second labeling with streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>, and flow cytometric analysis, binding of IL-5 to EBV-B cells cultured in fresh medium was demonstrated and could be competed for by excess unlabeled IL-5, suggesting the presence of IL-5-specific binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of IL-5 was reduced on cells cultured for longer periods before study but could be restored by extensively washing cells before labeling them with b-IL-5, suggesting that surface binding sites had become occupied by endogenously produced IL-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for IL-5 in autocrine support of EBV-B cell growth </plain></SENT>
