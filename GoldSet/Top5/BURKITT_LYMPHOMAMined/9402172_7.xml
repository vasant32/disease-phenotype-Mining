<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may carry, besides the c-myc translocation, several other lesions including a) mutations in c-myc, b) mutations in bcl-6, c) mutations in p53 and d) EBV genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe a unique study of the timing of these genetic lesions during the evolution and progression of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of two patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, we established three different cell lines from different sites or at different times in the clinical course of the disease (diagnosis and relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed by karyotyping and the presence of molecular lesions determined by Southern blot, PCR, SSCP and sequence analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In each patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clones carry identical c-myc translocations, identical bcl-6 status (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> or mutant) and the same productive VDJ rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, within each individual patient, we could demonstrate the presence of intraclonal variation with respect to EBV, p53 mutations and c-myc mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: c-myc translocation and bcl-6 mutations appear to be early events, mutations in the coding region of c-myc occur early but are an ongoing event, while mutations in the p53 gene seem to occur later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discrete clonal bands reflecting independent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> were observed in the cell lines from one HIV-associated Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, suggesting the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> may occur as a late event, at least in some HIV associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
