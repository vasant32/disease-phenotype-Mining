<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The membrane molecule termed "7F7-antigen" has been found to be involved in several examples of cell-cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 85 kDa <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> with a protein core of about 55 kDa contains N-linked and O-linked carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has an isoelectric point of 8.0-8.5 and is expressed on 20% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 35% of peripheral blood B-cells, follicular dendritic cells and vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also expressed on activated T-cells and its expression on B-cells, fibroblasts and monocytes increases after treatment with PWM, interferon-gamma and after three days culture, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MAb 7F7 used to define this antigen inhibits the initiation of T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3, PHA, ConA and (weakly) allogenic stimulator cells, but does not affect the growth of IL-2 dependent T-cells and does not interfere with the killing of PHA-blasts by allogenic IL-2 dependent T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>7F7 also inhibits the binding of C3-coated sheep erythrocytes to B-cells, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-induced aggregation of U937 and the binding of activated T-cells to fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 7F7-antigen is expressed on some non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of B-cell differentiation, particularly those with follicular structure, but not on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ALL or <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is, however, found on fibrous tissue surrounding infiltrating <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> antigen, P3.58, which was shown to be identical to 7F7-antigen correlates with stage and spread of invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the 7F7-antigen, which is probably related to a previously described adherence molecule (ICAM-1), is of biological importance for the initiation of T-cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With the possible exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> its expression on neoplastic cells in vivo is unlikely to be of importance for the spread of malignant disease </plain></SENT>
