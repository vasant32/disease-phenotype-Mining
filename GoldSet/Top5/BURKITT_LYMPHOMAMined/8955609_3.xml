<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 46 lesions, 33 were located in the orbit, 12 in the conjunctiva, and one in the eyelid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen cases were benign (reactive) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasias</z:mpath>, and 31 were diagnosed as malignant lymphoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytologic features of the reactive group included a polymorphic lymphoid population intermixed with scattered tingible body macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the malignant category, there were 28 malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 28 cases were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytologically, the malignant group consisted of a monomorphic population of atypical lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 malignant lymphoid lesions, 58% (18 tumors) were small lymphocytic proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 13 tumors were classified as follows: mixes small/large cell or pure large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (nine), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> (three), and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Final classification using the Working Formulation was made after evaluating the cytologic preparations and surgical material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, the monoclonal nature of the malignant lymphoproliferative lesions was confirmed by flow cytometry and/or immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytologic preparations of the fresh specimens preserve the morphologic details of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, which is especially important when evaluating lymphoid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, multiple smears can be prepared simultaneously for ancillary studies such as immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of our 46 lymphoproliferative lesions, two-thirds were diagnosed as malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 50% of which were low grade using the Working Formulation </plain></SENT>
