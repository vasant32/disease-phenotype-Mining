<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C-beta (PKCβ) targeting showed promising results in preclinical and clinical studies involving a wide variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, but studies describing the role of PKCβ in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-NHL are primitive if not lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present study, 3 AIDS-NHL cell lines were examined: 2F7 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), BCBL-1 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-primary effusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), and UMCL01-101 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunoblot analysis demonstrated expression of PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 in 2F7 and UMCL01-101 cells, and PKCβ1 alone in BCBL-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The viability of 2F7 and BCBL-1 cells decreased significantly in the presence of PKCβ-selective inhibitor at half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 14 and 15 μmol/L, respectively, as measured by tetrazolium dye reduction assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, UMCL01-101 cells were relatively resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As determined using flow cytometric deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling assay with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining, the responsiveness of sensitive cells was associated with apoptotic induction and cell cycle inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C-beta-selective inhibition was observed not to affect AKT phosphorylation but to induce a rapid and sustained reduction in the phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 beta, ribosomal protein S6, and mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> in sensitive cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that PKCβ plays an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related NHL survival and suggest that PKCβ targeting should be considered in a broader spectrum of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observations in BCBL-1 were unexpected in the absence of PKCβ2 expression and implicate PKCβ1 as a regulator in those cells </plain></SENT>
