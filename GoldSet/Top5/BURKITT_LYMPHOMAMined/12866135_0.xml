<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) presence rate in our laboratory's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> tissue biopsies for comparison with that reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of EBV has been established in Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>), endemic Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> and some non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been linked to geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic factors, with a lower rate in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the immunoperoxidase technique to determine the rate of the EBV LMP-1 in eighty-seven biopsies diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue slides were stained using the Ventana Automated Slide Stainer with the DAKO EBV LMP-1 primary antibody and the results were analyzed with the SYSTAT program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found an LMP-1 positive rate of 50% for 22 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> and 35% for 63 cases of NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>, 5 were children and 16 were adults, with LMP-1 positive rates of 60% and 50% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among NHL, 3 were children and 59 were adults, with equal LMP-1 positive rates of 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sex LMP-1 positive rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> were 42% for 12 males and 60% for 10 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among NHL, the sex LMP-1 positive rates were 39% for 38 males and 28% for 27 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NHL was further subdivided into subtypes and LMP-1 primary antibody positive rates were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a similar presence rate of EBV in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> biopsies to that of developed countries, but a similar presence rate of EBV in NHL biopsies to that of developing countries </plain></SENT>
