<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here our findings in cytogenetic studies of direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> preparations from 18 non-African Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, 9 of whom also had cell lines available for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A t(8;14) was found in direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> material in 10 of the 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 9 cell lines had a t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 patients had either a t(8;14) or a 14q+ present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> material and/or cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 8 patients had a peculiar marker chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The t(8;14) was not found in every malignant cell and, where present, it was rarely the sole karyotypic abnormality </plain></SENT>
