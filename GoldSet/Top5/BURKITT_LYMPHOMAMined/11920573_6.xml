<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TAPASIN, a V-C1 (variable-constant) immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecule that links MHC class I molecules to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is encoded by the TAPBP gene, located near to the MHC at 6p21.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A related gene was identified at chromosome position 12p13.3 between the CD27 and VAMP1 genes near a group of MHC-paralogous loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene, which we have called TAPBP-R (R for related), also encodes a member of the IgSF, TAPASIN-R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its putative product contains similar structural motifs to TAPASIN, with some marked differences, especially in the V domain, transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using the mouse ortholog to screen tissue, we revealed that the TAPBP-R gene was broadly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sub-cellular localization showed that the bulk of TAPASIN-R is located within the ER but biotinylation experiments were consistent with some expression at thecell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TAPASIN-R lacks an obvious ER retention signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The function of TAPASIN-R will be of interest in regards to the evolution of the immune system as well as antigen processing </plain></SENT>
