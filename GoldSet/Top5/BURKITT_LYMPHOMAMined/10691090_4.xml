<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neolacto series <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> IV3NeuAc-nLc4 (2--&gt;3-sialosylparagloboside) is present in members of the monocyte/granulocyte lineage, but is not found in cells that belong to the lymphocyte lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we demonstrated that IV3NeuAc-nLc4 inhibits the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-positive Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells of the lines Raji and P3HR-1K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IV3NeuAc-nLc4-induced growth inhibition is associated with an increase in G0/G1 phase cells and a reduced expression of CD21 and HLA-DR antigens on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IV3NeuAc-nLc4 may affect differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the increased expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species which are characteristic for the lytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cycle in the non-producer line Raji and the enhanced release of virions from the producer line P3HR-1K demonstrate that IV3NeuAc-nLc4 activates the replication of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition and termination of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency suggest that IV3NeuAc-nLc4 present in monocyte/granulocyte lineage cells may be an effector of the natural defense against EBV persistency and transformation </plain></SENT>
