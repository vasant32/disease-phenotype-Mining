<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the methylation patterns of CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the regulatory region of the latent Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV) promoter BCR2 (also called C promoter, Cp) using automated fluorescent genomic sequencing after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-induced modification of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCR2 is one of the alternative promoters for transcripts encoding the growth-transformation-associated nuclear antigens EBNA 1-6 which are expressed in a host <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Well characterized clones isolated from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) line Mutu differing from each other as to their phenotype and EBV latent gene expression were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that in Mutu <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> III clone 99 which is actively using the BCR2 promoter the regulatory sequences are unmethylated with two exceptions (position 10702 and 10799) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there are 15 methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> in the same region in Mutu <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> I clone 216 where the BCR2 promoter is silent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">Cytosines</z:chebi> which are potential targets of DNA methyltransferase in the immediate vicinity or within the attachment sites of cellular C promoter binding factors CBF1 and CBF2 remained hypomethylated in Mutu <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> I clone 216 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests a role for a hypermethylated region (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 10666 -10865, -639 to -440 bases upstream from the beginning of the TATA box at position 11305) in silencing of the BCR2 promoter in these cells </plain></SENT>
