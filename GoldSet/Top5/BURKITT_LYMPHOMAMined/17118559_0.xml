<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Ramos cells, a human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, stimulation of the B cell antigen receptor with anti-IgM antibody (Ab) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as indicated by a decrease in cell viability and an increase in DNA fragmentation and cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these changes are suppressed by incubating the cells in alpha(1)-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (AGP)-coated tissue culture plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that, during Anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Ramos cells, caspase-3 is activated downstream of caspase-8 and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway is activated, as indicated by a loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, an increase in the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> to the cytoplasm, and enhanced Bax expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neuraminidase-treated Ramos cells was suppressed by incubating the cells on plates coated with AGP, which contains a high concentration of alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incubation on plates coated with AGP also suppressed anti-IgM Ab-stimulated caspase-3 activity and increased the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (XIAP), but it did not affect caspase-8 activity, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release, or Bax expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the interaction of Ramos cells with immobilized alpha2,6-linked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> enhances XIAP expression, directly or indirectly suppressing caspase-3 activity and inhibiting anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
