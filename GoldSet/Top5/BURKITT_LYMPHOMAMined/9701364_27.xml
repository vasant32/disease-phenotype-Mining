<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because the development of drug-resistant cells can lead to relapses in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with chemotherapy, new approaches are needed for effective disease management, such as those targeting the c-MYC proto-oncogene with antisense oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate whether antisense c-myc oligonucleotides could prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in a B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunocompetent mice received subcutaneous injections of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from a transgenic mouse model of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 7 consecutive days, beginning 1 day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell transplantation, the mice were given either a DNA phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to c-myc codons 1-5 (myc6) or other c-myc-related oligonucleotides at a dose of 0.76 mg per day subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myc protein expression, normalized to beta-actin expression, was measured by western blotting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and splenic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> inhibition by myc6 could be a result of B-cell activation, we compared the activity of myc6 with that of an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, mcg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with control treatments (saline vehicle, scrambled-sequence oligonucleotide, or double-mismatch oligonucleotide), treatment with myc6 delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by 3 days, decreased total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass at sacrifice (i.e., 17 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell transplantation) by 40% +/- 16% (mean +/- standard error), and decreased the splenic Myc-to-actin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by myc6 and mcg (both of which share a dACGTT motif) was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to c-myc codons 384-388 (myc55) delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by 5-6 days, decreased total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass at sacrifice by 65% +/- 6%, and reduced the splenic Myc-to-actin ratio to below that produced by myc6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 14-day treatment regimen of myc55 alternating with mcg completely inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation during the therapeutic schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined oligonucleotide regimen, based on antisense c-MYC and immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, should be investigated to increase the number and duration of complete remissions obtained after standard chemotherapy for B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
