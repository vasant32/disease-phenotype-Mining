<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of STAT1 in these cells is modulated by the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), but the mechanism of STAT1 activation has remained unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in LCLs results from an indirect pathway encompassing an NF-kappaB-dependent secretion of interferons (IFNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell culture supernatant of LCLs induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in cells with no constitutively activated STAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, removal of supernatant from LCLs was sufficient to decrease the phosphorylation of STAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by different pharmacological inhibitors (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7939">parthenolide</z:chebi>, MG132 and BAY 11-7082) and by overexpressed mutated IkappaBalpha prevented the activation of STAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To identify the factors involved, we performed macroarray cDNA profiling with or without inhibition of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of several cytokines was NF-kappaB dependent among those alpha and gamma IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma), known activators of STAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we show that IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma are expressed and released by LCLs in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the blocking of the IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma by neutralizing antibodies led to the complete inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results clearly show that LMP1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is almost exclusively due to the NF-kappaB-dependent secretion of IFNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether this response, which is usually considered to be antiviral, is in fact required for the persistence of the virus remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
