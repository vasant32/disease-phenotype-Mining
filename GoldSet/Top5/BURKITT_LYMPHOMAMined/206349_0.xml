<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracts of 5 BL and 5 NPC biopsies gave a brilliant, EBNA specific fluorescence after binding to acid fixed chicken red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar extracts of 3 other African <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that are not known to carry the EBV-genome were negative, in spite of the fact that they were derived from EBV-seropositive patients with relatively high anti-EBV (VCA) antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude extraction and DNA-cellulose purification gave equally active extracts, provided that incubation was carried out at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that the acid fixed nuclear binding technique can be applied to biopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may be helpful in searching for EBNA carrying cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues in vivo where the direct in situ ACIF staining for EBNA is known to meet great difficulties </plain></SENT>
