<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the components is obviously identical to the recently described neutrophil-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 2 (NAP-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In further investigations on this protein preparation (called factor C) we are able to show an additional influence on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-cytolytic activities of mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total neutralization of the factor C effect, by treating a factor C preparation with specific monoclonal antibody C24 prior to application in cell culture, proved that the effect is really restricted to factor C proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If factor C is given in combination with natural interleukin-2 (IL-2) a dose-dependent suppression of IL-2-mediated natural killer lymphokine-activated killer activity can be measured, which is first detectable 72 h after addition of factor C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suppression does not occur if the both factors are added within a time interval of more than 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of monocytes from mononuclear cells has no effect on factor-C-mediated cytotoxicity, demonstrating that factor C acts directly on lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
