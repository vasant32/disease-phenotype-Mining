<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three C-P3Hs (nomenclature was amended according to approval by the HGNC symbols and names at http://www.genenames.org/ and Entrez database at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) leucineproline-enriched <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> (leprecan) 1 (Lepre1), leprecan-like 1 (Leprel1), leprecan-like 2 (Leprel2) and two paralogs Cartilage-Related Protein (CRTAP) and leprecan-like 4 (Leprel4) are found in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The C-P4Hs are tetrameric proteins comprising a variable α subunit, encoded by the P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3 genes and a constant β subunit encoded by P4HB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used RT-PCR, qPCR, pyrosequencing, methylation-specific PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry to investigate expression and regulation of the C-P3H and C-P4H genes in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C-P3H and C-P4H are downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation is associated with methylation in the CpG islands and is detected in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common types of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, but the CpG islands are unmethylated or methylated at lower levels in DNA isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation of multiple C-P3H and C-P4H genes is present in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, particularly Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of C-P3H and C-P4H is common in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and may have utility in differentiating disease subtypes </plain></SENT>
