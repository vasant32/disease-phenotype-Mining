<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the total of 5345 cases in the data bank, 610 met the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution of both simple gains (349 cases) and simple losses (261 cases) throughout the genome was distinctly nonrandom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes #8, #9, #12, and #21 were more often trisomic, whereas, chromosomes #7, #22, and Y were the ones most often lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of simple aberrations varied widely in different diseases: 29.6% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, 24.2% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, 16.9% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera, 8.1% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 4.2% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 1.4% in non-Hodgkin non-Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numerical changes have been correlated and compared with the specific structural rearrangements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and tentative pathogenetic mechanisms whereby numerical aberrations might enhance neoplastic development are discussed </plain></SENT>
