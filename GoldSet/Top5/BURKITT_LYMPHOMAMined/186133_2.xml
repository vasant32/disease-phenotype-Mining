<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method is easy, requires only a small number of cells and allows simultaneous testing of many enzymatic activities from the same sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three cell lines can be easily distinguished despite their close origin: NAB, derived from a malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroperitoneal mass</z:e> in an American patient, is the cell line with the greatest total activity and HRlK (a clone of P3J, derived from an African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) with the lowest and RAJI (a non-virus producing line derived from an African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) being the intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The more striking differences concern the activity of phosphatases (NAB greater than RAJI greater than or equal to HRlK), esterases-lipases (NAB greater than or equal to RAJI greater than HRlK), beta glucosaminidase, beta glucuronidase beta glucosidase (NAB greater than or equal to RAJI greater than HRlK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, alpha mannosidase and alpha fucosidase are more active in RAJI (RAJI greater than NAB greater than or equal to HRlK) </plain></SENT>
