<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) accumulation in endogenous membrane substrates was stimulated by vanadate or nonionic detergents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When in vitro phosphorylation was carried out at 0 degree C in the presence of 1 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29035">Mn2+</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100, P-Tyr constituted up to 40-50% of the total phospho amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">Polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis showed that membranes from mixed lymphocyte populations have four major P-Tyr-containing proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas nonionic detergents were potent stimuli for P-Tyr accumulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four substrates, tyrosine phosphorylation of two of these (p61 and p55) was markedly dependent on vanadate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two substrates were present in membranes from surface Ig-bearing splenic lymphocytes purified by affinity chromatography and Raji, a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P-Tyr accumulation in the two other substrates observed in splenocyte membranes (p64 and p58) was much less dependent on vanadate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p64 and p58 were phosphorylated in membranes from mouse thymocytes and human and mouse T-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, while p61 and p55 were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus it appears that in both murine and human lymphocytes, p64 and p58 served as T-cell-specific substrates, while p61 and p55 were specifically associated with B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these distinct P-Tyr substrate patterns were conserved in some neoplastic cell lines derived from B and T cells </plain></SENT>
