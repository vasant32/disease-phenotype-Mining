<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human polyomavirus, JCV, is the etiological agent of the fatal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disease</z:e>, progressive multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> (PML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In PML patients, JC Virus (JCV) can be detected in glial cells in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>); in B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and tonsil; and in tonsillar stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, JCV infects glial cells, tonsillar stromal cells, and to a limited extent B-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of as yet unidentified cell type specific transcription factors contributes to the restricted tropism of JCV for these cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, several studies indicate that cell surface receptors may also contribute to the limited host range of JCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine this latter possibility we measured the binding of purified JCV virions to primary cultures of glial cells, tonsillar stromal cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and to several established cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that JCV binds to primary glial cells, stromal cells, and B cells, but does not bind to primary T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, JCV bound to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested, including the Namalwa B cell line and the Jurkat T cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data are novel and demonstrate that JCV selectively interacts with cells in vivo that are known to be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This selectivity appears to be lost when one examines virus binding to a variety of human, monkey, or mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We next examined the susceptibility of primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and the Namalwa B cell line to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with JCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the majority of infectious JCV virions remain cell surface associated and do not efficiently establish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may explain the in vivo observation that JCV DNA is frequently detected in association with lymphocytes by PCR but that JCV <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is rarely detected in association with lymphocytes by reverse transcriptase PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results also confirm previous data regarding the association of JCV with human B cells in vivo and support the hypothesis that B cells may be involved in trafficking of JCV to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
