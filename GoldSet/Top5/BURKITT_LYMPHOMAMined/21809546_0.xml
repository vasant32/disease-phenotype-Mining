<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Raji cells were cultured in vitro and treated by different final concentrations (0.4, 0.8, 1.6 mg/mL) of matrine or combined with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) before matrine was added, then cocultured for 48 h, cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate was detected by Annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>/PI double staining method and the P-p38 MAPK, Fas, FasL protein expresssion of Raji cells were evaluated by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After cells were treated by matrine (0.4, 0.8, 1.6 mg/mL), the corresponding total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate (15.77 +/- 0.53)%, (27.88 +/- 1.52)%, (48.08 +/- 2.87)%, had statistical significance compared with SB203580 groups (11 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the concentration of matrine gradually increased,the protein expresssion levels of P-p38MAPK, Fas, FasL increased, and decreased after SB203580 were added, the correlation of P-p38MAPK and Fas, FasL was obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Matrine can upregulation of Fas and FasL to promote the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells, it may be related to p38MAPK Activation </plain></SENT>
