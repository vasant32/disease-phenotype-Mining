<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EBV genomes carried by the parental cell lines differ in sequence and in their physical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> 60 EBV genome is integrated into the host cell genome whereas the LCL IARC 277 carries exclusively episomal EBV molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hybrid cells contain both EBV genomes and display the differentiation phenotype of the parental LCL with regard to growth characteristics and cell-surface antigen expression in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the EBNA 1 and EBNA 2 gene expression of the LCL-derived EBV is maintained in these hybrid cells, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-60-derived EBNA 1 and EBNA 2 genes are transcriptionally down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mapping of the genomic region surrounding the latent Cp promoter of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-60-derived EBV revealed an extensive deletion upstream of the Cp promoter including the enhancer element in the ori P region, the origin of latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication (ori P), the coding sequences for the EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) and the EBV terminal protein (TP), and suggested that one <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-cellular junction sequence is located near the Cp promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integration of EBV into the host cell genome together with the extensive deletion might be causally related with the altered latent gene expression pattern after introduction of a lymphoblastoid host-cell background by somatic cell fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-60-derived EBNA genes could be due to loss of regulatory sequences in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-derived EBV necessary for EBNA 1 and EBNA 2 transcription in the lymphoblastoid hybrid cells, but not in the parental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
