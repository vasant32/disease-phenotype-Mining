<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal conditions for growth in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> medium are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The original EBV-negative lines can grow in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> to a high efficiency, provided a critical level of cell concentration is attained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Below this level, there is no growth at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-converted sublines form colonies at a much lower cell concentration, and their maximal plating efficiency is higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences may be related to a super-transformation state induced in these cells by EBV </plain></SENT>
