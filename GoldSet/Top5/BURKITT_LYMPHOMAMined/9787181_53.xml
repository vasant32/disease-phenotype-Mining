<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss and mutation of this gene has been reported in epithelial derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100843'>glioblastoma</z:hpo> multiforme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the potential involvement of PTEN in the pathogenesis of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 27 hematopoietic cell lines (representing a variety of lymphoid lineages), 65 primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> (including 24 lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [LBL], 30 large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [LBCL], 7 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>], and 4 anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALCL</z:e>]), and 25 nonmalignant lymph node controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene deletion and gross rearrangement were evaluated using Southern blot analysis, and mutations were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 27 cell lines (22.2%) and 3 of 65 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (4.6%) contained alterations of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large homozygous deletion spanning exons 2 through 5 was detected in one LBL cell line, and two insertions potentially resulting in premature termination, were detected in a second LBL cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonconservative nucleotide variations were found in two other cell lines (one LBCL and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and in one primary case of LBCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, two other cell lines (one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and one <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp>) and two primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, both LBCL, contained small deletions within intron 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These deletions mapped to a poly-T-rich tract just 5' to the intron 7/exon 8 spice site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their significance is unclear, as they may represent polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results suggest that abnormalities of the PTEN gene can contribute to pathogenesis in a small percentage of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
