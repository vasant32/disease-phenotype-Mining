<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The endocytosis and degradation of 125I-labeled anti-mu monoclonal antibody DA4-4 by a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line was investigated using biochemical, chromatographic, electrophoretic, radioautographic, and electron microscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>125I-DA4-4 was rapidly internalized by Ramos cells and routed from endosomes to lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteolysis of radiolabeled antibodies began in a late endosomal compartment, but lysosomes were primarily responsible for the terminal degradation of 125I-DA4-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catabolism of 125I-DA4-4 could be inhibited by 74-95% by blocking its delivery to late endosomes and lysosomes by incubation at 18 degrees C, by neutralizing the pH in intracellular organelles with monensin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">ammonium chloride</z:chebi>, or by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes with leupeptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiolabeled antibodies synthesized using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine T</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">Iodo</z:chebi>-Gen techniques were degraded three times faster than conjugates made using a nonmetabolizable 125I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17057">cellobiose</z:chebi> adduct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five major intermediate metabolites (Mr 48,000, 42,000, 25,000, 15,000, and 10,000) were generated during the intracellular catabolism of 125I-DA4-4, but 125I-tyrosine was responsible for 95% of the small-molecular-weight metabolites released by cells into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that a full comprehension of the catabolism of radiolabeled antibodies by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells will make possible the development of clinical interventions which will enhance the retention of radioimmunoconjugates by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and improve the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
