<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Asian race/ethnicity was evaluated using lists of Asian surnames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average annual incidence rates (per million) for 1988 to 1992 were calculated for non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian children (age &lt;15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) for 1988 to 1995 were used to compare Southeast Asian children to non-Hispanic white children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the Asian children, 4.2% (30/722) were misclassified by subgroup, predominantly Hmong listed as Laotian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rate was 134.2 versus 159.2 for non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumor</z:mpath> rate was higher in Asians (9.9) than in non-Hispanic whites (4.8), but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> rate was two-thirds lower (3.1 vs. 9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were lower (2.8 vs. 5.6 and 20.0 vs. 33.8) in Asians than non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-Hispanic whites, the PIR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> in Southeast Asian children was reduced (PIR = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Southeast Asian children had increased PIRs for Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (PIR = 2.6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> not classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (PIR = 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accurate race/ethnicity classification of Southeast Asian children is a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Marked differences were found in the incidence and PIRs of specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> among Southeast Asian children, other Asian children, and other children in California </plain></SENT>
