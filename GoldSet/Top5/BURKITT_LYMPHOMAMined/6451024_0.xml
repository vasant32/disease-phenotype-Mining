<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The low-avidity T cells (T1) had developed into more potent effectors than the high-avidity (Te) when assessed in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In ADCC and SCMC both subsets exhibited low but consistent lysis with no demonstrable differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of human leucocyte interferon to the ADCC and SCMC cultures resulted in enhanced SCMC, most notable and to an equal extent with the T cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ADCC of unseparated cells, non-T cells, and the two T subsets was found to be unchanged after interferon addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data are discussed in relation to findings with human T-cell subpopulations purified by other methods </plain></SENT>
