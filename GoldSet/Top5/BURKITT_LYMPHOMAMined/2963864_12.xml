<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human serum-treated Raji and Daudi cells were shown to bind C3 fragments on their surface as a consequence of their capacity to activate C via the alternative pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C3 molecules were detectable on the cell surfaces up to 24 h after serum exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The C3 fragment-coated cells showed increased sensitivity to spontaneous lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effector lymphocytes involved in the enhanced cytotoxicity were NK cells with low buoyant density, carrying both CR3 and FcR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blocking of the FcR and CR3 with F(ab)2 fragments from Leu-11c or Leu-15 mAb, respectively, did not influence the lysis of targets that did not carry C3 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the accessibility of CR3 on the effector lymphocytes was essential for the C3 fragment-mediated enhancement of cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Leu-15 antibody, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17411">N-acetyl-D-Glucosamine</z:chebi>, a compound known to block iC3b binding to CR3, also abrogated the C3 fragment-imposed effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our previous experiments showed that the C3 fragments bind to acceptor sites on target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present experiments show that the C3 fragments fixed onto the target bind to CR3 on effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data substantiate the hypothesis that the bivalent C3 fragments, which are fixed on the targets, promote their interaction with lytic lymphocytes by bridging the two cells </plain></SENT>
