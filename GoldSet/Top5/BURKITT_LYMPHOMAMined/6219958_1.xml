<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to detect C3b receptors on human lymphoblastoid cells using a solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) specific for human C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RIA was performed by coupling rabbit antihuman C3b to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> beads to make immunobeads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specificity and sensitivity of binding of 125I-C3b to immunobeads allowed the detection of as little as 6 X 10(-10) M unlabeled human C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells were incubated with a C3b concentration (10(-9) M) giving 25% inhibition in the RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of unbound C3b was then measured in the cell supernatants using RIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that: (a) loss of C3b antigen in the cell supernatant was not due to degradation of C3b molecules, (b) C3b binding could be detected at 37 degrees C on the four B cell lines, but not on the two T cell lines or on the two non T-non B cell lines tested, (c) C3b bound on the B lymphoblastoid cells was not cleaved, neither into iC3b nor C3c and C3d fragments, supporting the presence of C3b receptors on the cells tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method allows screening of a variety of C3b receptor-positive cells </plain></SENT>
