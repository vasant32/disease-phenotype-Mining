<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B95-8 strain of EBV was estimated to contain 8.6 repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The repeat number varies considerably among naturally occurring isolates around a mean of six repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some cell lines harbored multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes with differing numbers of repeats and our results suggest that the repeat number in IR-1 is more likely to change during lytic replication than during latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Jijoye strain had 6.6 repeats and the Jijoye deletion mutant clone P3HR-1 retained 5.9 repeats setting the size of the P3HR-1 deletion at 6.8 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the nonimmortalizing mutant has retained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the W1 and W2 exons of the immortalizing parent and has lost only the 3' unique exons of EBNA4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of EBNA2 </plain></SENT>
