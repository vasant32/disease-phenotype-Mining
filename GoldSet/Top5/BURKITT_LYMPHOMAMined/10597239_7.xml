<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lack of detectable expression of p27kip1 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor has previously been correlated with high degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in human breast, colorectal, gastric and small cell <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that an inverse correlation between p27kip1 expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> also exists in most types of human B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clear exception was Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), a highly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumour</z:e> which often expresses high levels of p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of p27kip1 derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines expressing high levels of p27kip1, BL40 and BL41, in a cyclin E/cdk2 kinase inhibition assay demonstrated that p27kip1 is not permanently inactivated since heat treatment can restore the inhibitory activity of p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, p27kip1 expressed in these two cell lines is largely sequestered in inactive complexes and we have no evidence that c-myc or Epstein-Barr virus are responsible for the sequestration of p27kip1 in these two cell lines although c-myc and EBV are two oncogenic agents often associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we observed that high level p27kip1 expression often correlated with cyclin D3 overexpression both in vivo and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of p27kip1 in BL40 cells was complexed with cyclin D3 indicating that overexpressed cyclin D3 may at least be part of the sequestering activity for the inhibitory function of p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cyclinD3/cdk4 complex could sequester p27kip1 in a cyclin E/cdk2 kinase assay in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that cyclin D3 transfected into an inducible p27kip1 cell line could overcome the G1 arrest mediated by p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results argue that in addition to down-regulation of p27kip1 expression, some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells can sequester and tolerate the antiproliferative function of p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also suggest a novel role for the overexpression of D-type cyclins as one pathway allowing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells to overcome the antiproliferative function of p27kip1 </plain></SENT>
