<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we demonstrate that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant human B-lymphocytes specifically bind and internalize <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioiodinated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (125I-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) was used to follow the uptake of the protein by Raji cells, a human pre-B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time course studies of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> uptake by these cells exhibited a saturable profile at both 4 and 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding saturation curve obtained by incubating Raji cells at 4 degrees C with different concentrations (1.5 nM to 1.5 microM) of 125I-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> showed two saturation plateaus; Scatchard analysis showed the presence of two groups of receptor sites with a Kd1 of 2.04 x 10(-7) M (n1 = 42,161 +/- 4,336 sites/cell) and a Kd2 of 1.01 x 10(-6) M (n2 = 198,000 +/- 48,000 sites/cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation of Raji cells at 37 degrees C with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) and horseradish peroxidase conjugates, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> was internalized and could be localized in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were used to follow the uptake and to determine the endocytic pathway of the protein in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial steps, contrary to those observed for AFP, did not apparently involve coated pits and vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small vesicles (approximately 50-60 nm) with electron-dense <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>-horseradish peroxidase reaction products were observed that could fuse with large endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These endosomes appeared dispersed in the cytoplasm with some preferential localization in the Golgi centrosphere region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulse-chase experiments showed that only 10% of the uptaken protein was released in a nondegraded form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, most <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> molecules accumulated in endosomes should be degraded in lysosomes, instead of being recycled back to the surface, as in the case of AFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contrary to malignant B-cells (Raji), the uptake ability for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> quiescent B-lymphocytes was very low </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant values of uptake were obtained at 37 degrees C after 72 h of incubation in the presence of pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The binding of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> was partially inhibited in the presence of an excess of unlabeled protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the actual results suggest that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> receptors are constitutively expressed by malignant B-cells and in a transitory form by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-lymphocytes undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
