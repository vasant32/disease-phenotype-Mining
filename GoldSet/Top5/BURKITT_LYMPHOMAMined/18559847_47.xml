<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue is relatively transparent to NIR, which suggests that targeting <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNTs</z:chebi> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, followed by noninvasive exposure to NIR light, will ablate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> within the range of NIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate the specific binding of antibody-coupled <z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNTs</z:chebi> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in vitro, followed by their highly specific ablation with NIR light </plain></SENT>
