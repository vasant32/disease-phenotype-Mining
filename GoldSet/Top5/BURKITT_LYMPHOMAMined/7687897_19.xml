<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By immunophenotype, the distribution of positive cases favored early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> (83%; n = 180) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> (61%; n = 89) and then T-cell ALL (46%; n = 61) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the B-lineage cases, CD34 expression was significantly associated with favorable presenting features: age 1 to 10 years, white race, absence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, low serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase level, CD10 expression, and leukemic cell hyperdiploidy (&gt; 50 chromosomes or DNA index &gt; or = 1.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival was clearly superior for patients with CD34+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (P = .01), with an estimated 83% +/- 6% (SE) of the cohort remaining free of adverse events at 5 years post diagnosis, as compared to 63% +/- 10% of the group without this feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the prognostic influence of the antigen was independent of age, leukocyte count, and other well-recognized factors, suggesting that it would add discriminatory power to current systems of risk assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings in T-cell ALL were the reverse: CD34 expression showed positive correlations with initial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and CD10 negativity but not with any good-risk presenting characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Log-rank analysis indicated no adverse effect on treatment outcome by CD34 antigen expression, although additional patients with need to be studied to obtain a definitive answer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The opposed clinical associations of CD34 expression in B- and T-lineage ALL may reflect fundamental biologic differences between these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> species </plain></SENT>
