<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A low concentration has a slight mitogenic effect but higher concentrations inhibit proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect is associated with increases in cell size, macromolecular content, and incorporation of precursors into <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis indicates that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> at 1-10 nM leads to an apparent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, within this population a significant proportion of cells undergo nuclear division but fail to carry out cytokinesis, giving rise to cells with two or more nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, DNA synthesis continues in cells which cease to divide in the presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> to inhibit proliferation can thus be attributed mainly to an inhibition of cytokinesis rather than DNA replication </plain></SENT>
