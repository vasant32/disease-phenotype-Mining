<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a large number of studies on the biological activities of PSK as regards the activation of immunocompetent cells and the potential cytotoxic effects on epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only a few studies have been conducted to see the direct cytotoxic effects of PSK on hematological malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether or not PSK was able to induce cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hematological malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PSK was found to inhibit cell growth, and induced subsequent cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the Burkkit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Namalwa), out of 33 hematological malignant cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This PSK-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was neutralized by the addition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> to the culture medium, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was augmented by treatment with beta-galactosidase, indicating the inhibitory involvement of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> in the mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide initial evidence of the direct cytotoxic activity of PSK in a hematological malignant cell line, thus encouraging further molecular-level study of PSK-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in malignant hematological cells </plain></SENT>
