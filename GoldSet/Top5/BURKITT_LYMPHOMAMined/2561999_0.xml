<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, the lysis was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (mAb J-90) directed against the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the target cell lysis by mAb J-90 is not due to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>-scavenging mechanism, as suggested by the use of control mAb Dako M-1 (anti CD-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As detected by the microscopic examination of samples from test tubes and measured by monitoring the light transmission from the cell suspensions, neutrophils and Daudi cells were found to co-aggregate during the lytic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Co-aggregation was efficiently inhibited by the mAb J-90 </plain></SENT>
