<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This area is affected directly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in many clinical situations and has an indirect relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren</z:e>'s have a spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> from benign lymphoepithelial disease (BLD) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and a significantly greater incidence of the latter than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and also benign and malignant lymphoid disease in the parotid illustrate various diagnostic considerations </plain></SENT>
