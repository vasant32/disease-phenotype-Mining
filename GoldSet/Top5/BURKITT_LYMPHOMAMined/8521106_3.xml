<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Epstein-Barr virus is periodically shed in the saliva of persons infected by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, particularly high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because high-grade subtypes represent the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that arise in oral soft tissues, we hypothesized that Epstein-Barr virus might be preferentially associated with oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A series of 34 oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were diagnosed according to the revised European-American classification scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were examined for the presence of latent Epstein-Barr virus by EBER1 in situ hybridization and for expression of the Epstein-Barr virus replicative protein, BZLF1, by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epstein-Barr virus EBER1 transcripts were detected in 11 of 31 oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> including 7 of 10 AIDS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and only 4 of 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that occurred in nonimmunocompromised persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus-containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high-grade histologic subtypes, that is, diffuse large cell, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, or Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus was not detected in any of five low-grade oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the single case of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in this study, EBER1 was expressed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A switch from <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency to replication, as measured by EBV BZLF1 expression, was identified in rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells in only four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication was not higher than what has been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising at other anatomic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although one of our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arose at a site of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206186" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral hairy leukoplakia</z:e>, there was no other evidence that Epstein-Barr virus replication predisposed to development or persistence of oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that even though Epstein-Barr virus is frequently found in oral secretions, neither latent nor replicative Epstein-Barr virus is present more commonly in oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> arising in other anatomic sites, when controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
