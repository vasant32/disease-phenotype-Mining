<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of fluidity in the surface membranes was quantitatively monitored by fluorescence polarization analysis of the fluorescence probe, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51594">1,6-diphenyl 1,3,5-hexatriene</z:chebi>, when embedded in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> region of the surface membrane of intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results have shown that cells derived from malignant diseases have a more fluid <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> layer in their surface membrane than cells derived from non-malignant disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, suggested that a quantitative analysis of fluidity differences in the cell surface membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core can be of value to the studies on basic differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant cell lines established from the human hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
