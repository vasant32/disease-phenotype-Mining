<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in combination with adriamycin(ADM) on cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cell lines were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>,and cell proliferation was examined by the method of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) at different time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cellular apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was applied to distinguish the level of caspase-9 mRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the caspase-9 protein expression in Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation and increased the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner within 20-100 Î¼mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> alone, the proliferation of Raji cell lines incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and adriamycin was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caspase-9 mRNA and protein expression in Raji cells were significantly enhanced after the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> can inhibit the proliferation of Raji cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> may lead to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Raji cells by up-regulating activities of caspase-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adriamycin could intensify the effect </plain></SENT>
