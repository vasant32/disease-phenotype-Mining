<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 is an EBV-encoded sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is consistently expressed in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and required for stable maintenance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome in proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBNA1 is also thought to provide cell survival function in latently infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this work, the authors describe the development of a biochemical high-throughput screening (HTS) method using a homogeneous fluorescence polarization (FP) assay monitoring EBNA1 binding to its cognate DNA binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An FP-based counterscreen was developed using another EBV-encoded DNA binding protein, Zta, and its cognate DNA binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrate that EBNA1 binding to a fluorescent-labeled DNA probe provides a robust assay with a Z factor consistently greater than 0.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pilot screen of a small-molecule library of ~14,000 compounds identified 3 structurally related molecules that selectively inhibit EBNA1 but not Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 compounds had activity in a cell-based assay specific for the disruption of EBNA1 transcription repression function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the compounds was effective in reducing EBV genome copy number in Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These experiments provide a proof of concept that small-molecule inhibitors of EBNA1 can be identified by biochemical HTS of compound libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further screening in conjunction with medicinal chemistry optimization may provide a selective inhibitor of EBNA1 and EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
