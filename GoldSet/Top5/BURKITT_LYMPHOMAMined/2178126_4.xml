<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the presence of the EBV genome and active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in some Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines confer the susceptibility of HIV-1 infection in spite of the absence of surface CD4 receptors in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we used an EBV genome negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line, DG75, transfected with three different subgenomic fragments of EBV expressing the nuclear antigens (EBNA1 and EBNA2) and the latent membrane protein (LMP), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated CD4 expression in more than 90% of the EBNA1, EBNA2 and LMP transfected cell lines, whereas the antigen could only be detected in less than 4% of the parental DG75 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> DG75 line, the three transfected cell lines were shown to be susceptible to HIV-1 by both IFA and production of virions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Northern blotting of poly(A) selected <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of the four cell lines and hybridization to a human CD4 cDNA (pT4B) demonstrated a 3 kb band in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three EBNA1, EBNA2 and LMP transfected cells as well as in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> DG75 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximate quantification indicates equivalent level of T4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the transfected cell lines as compared to T-cell lines (Hut-78, H9-9) </plain></SENT>
