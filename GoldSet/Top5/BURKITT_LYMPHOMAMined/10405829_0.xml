<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell fusion is one method to immortalize desired cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we established HAT sensitive human fusion partners, ICLU-B derived from human burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, ICLU-T from human T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, ICLU-E from human eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, for efficiently making various human immunological hybridomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When each fusion partner was fused with human peripheral blood lymphocytes or cord blood lymphocytes, their fusion efficiencies were about 1.3, 0.3 and 0.4 clones per 10(5) fusion partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% of hybridomas derived from ICLU-B were CD19 positive hybridomas, and approximately 80% of those derived from ICLU-T were CD2 positive hybridomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD4 positive or CD8 positive hybridomas of the CD2 positive were approximately 35% and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Though approximately 80% of hybridomas derived from ICLU-E were CD2 or CD19 positive hybridomas, phagocytosis was observed in the remaining hybridomas which were both CD2 and CD19 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most obtained hybridomas could proliferate in serum free medium as well as the fusion partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that ICLU-B, -T, -E were useful for making human hybridomas derived from various immunological cells </plain></SENT>
