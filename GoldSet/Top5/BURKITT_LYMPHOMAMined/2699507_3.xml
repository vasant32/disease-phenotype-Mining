<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In most human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, translocation of the myc oncogene to an immunoglobulin locus is associated with loss of myc exon 1 or with mutations near its 3' border, a region where myc transcription is attenuated and translation of a larger myc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> initiates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emu-myc transgenic mice, which bear the three myc exons coupled to an immunoglobulin enhancer, provide a model for the development of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, because their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> appears to require events other than expression of the transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether myc rearrangement or exon 1 mutation is a necessary tumorigenic event, we examined the transgene structure and myc exon 1 sequences in Emu-myc B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598798" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blots revealed no transgene rearrangements in 20 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and only two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> showed amplification (2 to 5-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To search for exon 1 alterations, the exon 1 mRNA region was amplified from five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced, but no mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, neither excision nor mutation of exon 1 is necessary to render myc tumorigenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence analysis across the exon 1-exon 2 boundary unexpectedly revealed an ambiguity in myc splicing that predicts a variant form of the larger myc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> lacking a single amino acid residue </plain></SENT>
