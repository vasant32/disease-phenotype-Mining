<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A human <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell line, BALM-9, was established from the peripheral blood specimen of a immunoglobin (lg) phenotype, the established BALM-9 cell line expressed both kappa and lambda light (L) chains simultaneously in a range of 30-80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-color flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that there was a distinct population of kappa lambda double positive cells as well as kappa single, lambda single, and double negative populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, subclones were obtained from each population by limiting dilution and were designated BALM-9KL (kappa+lambda+), BALM-9K (kappa+lambda-), BALM 9N (kappa-lambda-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting confirmed the results of the immunofluorescence test at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In BALM-9N, L chains were absent even in the cytoplasm as demonstrated by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence that the subclones have the same ancestry was provided both by cytogenetic analysis and by Southern blotting, which revealed the 14q32 chromosomal rearrangement as a common abnormality and the same IgH gene arrangement among the subclones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of a kappa lambda positive B cell population suggests a transient stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These subclones might represent such a stage and thus provide a useful means of analyzing the mechanism of this double light chain expression </plain></SENT>
