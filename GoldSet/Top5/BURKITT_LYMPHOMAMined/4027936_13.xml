<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients had high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three, intermediate-grade histologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients were in Stage 4 and one was Stage 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three had the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during pregnancy, and in these three cases the disease appeared to progress rapidly after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other three women probably had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> during pregnancy; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was widespread at the time of their diagnosis, but the diagnosis was only established on biopsy specimens after delivery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had full-term natural deliveries with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature delivery</z:hpo> with a cesarean section in the 29th week because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>abruptio placentae</z:hpo> probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the uterine wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case both mother and child died within 48 hours of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other five patients were treated soon after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Published literature dealing with this topic is scanty and inconclusive; accordingly this report attempts to discuss management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in pregnancy, based on the authors' limited experience with these six patients </plain></SENT>
