<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on our recent observation that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detected in 37% of the tissues of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, and especially frequently in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV), the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> on the replication of HCV was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-infected cell clones and their EBV-uninfected counterparts in cell lines MT-2 (a human T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected T-cell line), HepG2 (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> cell line) and Akata (a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line) were compared in terms of their permissiveness for HCV replication following inoculation of HCV derived from patients who were HCV carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that EBV-infected cell clones, but not their EBV-uninfected counterparts, promoted HCV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), which is invariably expressed in EBV-infected cells, supported HCV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deletion analysis of the EBNA1 gene showed good correlation between transactivation activity and the activity supporting HCV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present findings suggest that EBV acts as a helper virus for HCV replication </plain></SENT>
