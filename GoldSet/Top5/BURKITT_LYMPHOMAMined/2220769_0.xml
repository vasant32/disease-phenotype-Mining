<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former two types are phenotypically constituted of quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> ALLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, phenotypes of cells from five L3 type ALL were analysed in FACS-IV using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients coexpressed la (HLA-DR), CD19, CD20, CD21, CD24, CD38, and surface immunoglobulins, whereas a negative reaction with MAbs CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, and Ti (WT31), Ti gamma A, delta TCS 1, and anti TCR-gamma/delta was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither myeloid-monocyte-erythroid nor megakaryocyte related cell surface antigens were detected in these cases with L3 type ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis of the ALL cells from two cases revealed a normoploid karyotype with specific translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), whereas it was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (46XY or 46XX) for the remaining three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of myc oncogene was high in the former group, but low in the later one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basing from our findings, we conclude that L3 type ALL is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to immunophenotypes, cytogenetics and oncogene analysis </plain></SENT>
