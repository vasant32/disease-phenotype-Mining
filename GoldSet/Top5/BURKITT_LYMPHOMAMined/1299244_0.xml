<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over a two-year period, immunophenotypic patterns of 266 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cases were analyzed using a panel of tests including TdT, SmIg and 9 surface antigens by the immunofluorescence stains for the assessment of the incidence and grade of phenotypic ambiguity (lineage infidelity) and the possible clinical significance of unusual immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypes were classified into four groups according to the degree of ectopic antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We classified as Group A (91.7%, 244 of 266 cases) those expressing conventional pattern without ectopic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B (3.0%, 8 of 266 cases) was defined to have at least two lineage specific markers and single ectopic antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such a "low grade deviation" did not prevent a definite immunodiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group C (4.2%, 11 of 266 cases) revealed a promiscuous coexpression of markers related to different lineages, including two cases (0.8%, 2 cases) of biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group D (1.1%, 3 cases) included unclassifiable immunophenotypes with no antigen or HLA-DR only expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients with biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one patient with unclassifiable immunophenotypes failed to respond to induction chemotherapy, suggesting a poor prognosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) cases with one or more ectopic surface antigens was 10 (8.1%) of the 124 AML cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ectopic antigen expression was seen in 5 (4%) of the 125 B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cases and 3 (25%) of the 12 T-ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that nearly 95% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cases can be diagnosed accurately with immunophenotyping alone including patients with a mild degree of deviation from expected antigenic patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
