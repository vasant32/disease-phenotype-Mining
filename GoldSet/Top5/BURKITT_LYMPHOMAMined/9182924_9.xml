<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the cytolytic effector pathway involved in impaired generation of nonrestricted cytolytic activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and SLE patients were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb) and interleukin-2 to promote the generation of nonrestricted cytolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 13 of culture, the PBMC were assayed for cytolytic activity against Fas-Daudi cells and Fas+ Jurkat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects on cytotoxicity of calcium chelation, <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anti-Fas MAb, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) alpha and beta, and ATP were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular perforin expression was determined by intracellular staining, and perforin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> levels were determined by quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated the existence of a cytolytic pathway that is independent of Fas, TNF alpha, TNF beta, and ATP, but is dependent upon extracellular calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite its calcium dependence, this pathway is associated with low-to-undetectable levels of perforin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Impaired generation of nonrestricted cytolytic activity in SLE is likely due to decreased activity of this Fas-, TNF alpha-, TNF beta-, ATP-independent pathway associated with very low levels of perforin </plain></SENT>
