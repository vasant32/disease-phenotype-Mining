<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-7, IL-1, and IL-6, of irradiated bone marrow-derived fibroblasts (Fb) and of in vitro matured peripheral blood macrophages (M phi), on the survival, proliferation, and maturation of purified blasts from nine common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALLs</z:e>) in 7-day suspension culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure to IL-3, IL-7, IL-1, and IL-6 resulted in a mean 2.8-, 1.5-, 1.4-, and 1.6-fold stimulation of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (3H-TdR) incorporation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cocultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> blasts with irradiated M phi, either allowing direct cell-cell contact or preventing it by membrane filters, or with irradiated Fb, resulted in a mean 31.7-, 4.1-, and 11.2-fold increase of 3H-TdR incorporation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements before and after culture indicated exclusive proliferation of the leukemic clone in three of eight samples, whereas additional generation of nonleukemic cells was found in five samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal growth pattern corresponded to the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cell populations using FACS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> blasts as defined by the detection of cells coexpressing both CD10 and CD19 after culture was supported by accessory cells in five of eight samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence of induced lymphoid maturation was found under any culture condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate supportive effects of stromal cells on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> growth, which cannot be replaced by IL-3 or IL-7 </plain></SENT>
