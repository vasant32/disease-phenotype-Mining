<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The TAL1 gene is altered as a consequence of t(1;14)(p32;q11) found in T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and shows site specific recombination (tald rearrangement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated TAL1 gene alterations in 39 children with T-cell ALL, in 32 with B-precursor ALL, in three with ALL with myeloid-associated antigen, and in 18 with T-non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (T-NHL). tald rearrangement was found in nine of 39 T-cell ALL patients using Southern blot analysis with a TAL1 gene probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products predicted from the sequences of the corresponding tald alleles were shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no rearranged band was observed in other kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or in T-NHL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients with tald rearrangement had CD1- CD2+ CD4- CD7+ CD10- pheno-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven were classified as stage I thymic differentiation, and eight have survived for three to 59 months remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of seven patients investigated had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, which has been reported to be associated with a good prognosis in T-cell ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that tald rearrangement is restricted to T-cell ALL, for which it provides a useful clonal marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such patients with this rearrangement may constitute a subgroup of T-cell ALL with a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
