<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphoid progenitors and B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) progenitors were assessed by using an in vitro cell colony assay specific for either B or T cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of VDR on B untreated malignant progenitors at diagnosis was investigated by RT-PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VD induced a significant inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid cell progenitors growth of both T and B lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VD inhibited significantly also the growth of malignant B cell lineage lymphoid progenitors, without inducing cytotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As it has been reported that VD effects on activated lymphocytes are mediated by 1,25-(OH)2-D3 nuclear receptor (VDR), we investigated VDR expression on malignant B cell progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not detect VDR expression on these cells examined at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that VD inhibited in vitro the clonogenic growth of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors and that this inhibitory effect on malignant B cell progenitors was not related to VDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our work contributes to understanding of the mechanism of action of this hormone in promoting cellular inhibition of clonal growth of malignant lymphoid B cell progenitors, suggesting that the regulation of some critical growth and differentiation factor receptors could be a key physiological role of this hormone </plain></SENT>
