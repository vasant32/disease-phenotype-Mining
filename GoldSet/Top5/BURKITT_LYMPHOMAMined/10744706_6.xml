<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-4 also triggers phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS), leading to stimulation of cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IL-4 inhibits proliferation of a variety of cells, but the molecular mechanism of its growth inhibitory effect is not understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that IL-4 inhibited cell growth of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines (HT29 and WiDr) but promoted cell growth of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (BL30 and BL41) in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibition was not dependent on Stat6 activation, because Stat6 was activated at similar levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines in response to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, IL-4 activated Stat1 in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines but not in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results suggest that IL-4 induced Stat1 activation, resulting in growth inhibition of colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we present evidence that Stat1 is necessary for IL-4-mediated growth inhibition using Stat1-deficient and Stat1-reconstituted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 was diminished in Stat1-deficient cells, whereas it was restored in Stat1-reconstituted cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of dominant-negative Stat1 in HT29 cells led to the loss of growth inhibition in response to IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data suggest that IL-4 activates Stat1, leading to cell growth inhibition in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study demonstrates, for the first time, a molecular mechanism by which IL-4 inhibits cell growth </plain></SENT>
