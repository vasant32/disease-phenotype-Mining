<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PUT cells carry no membrane immunoglobulin, but contained intracellular 61K mu chain and kappa chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PUTKO-1 hybrid, derived from the fusion of PUT with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023440" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">erythroleukemia</z:e> line K562 contains no detectable immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two different mu chains could be detected, both precipitated by either anti-mu or anti-lambda sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation with anti-kappa precipitated neither kappa nor mu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PUTRAL was derived by fusing PUT with Rael, an unusual surface-IgG-lambda-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this hybrid, the ability to synthesize gamma and lambda chains has been eclipsed, but two mu chains are present: one corresponding to the truncated 61K chain of PUT, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized 74K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between 20 and 30% of the cells stain for surface IgM </plain></SENT>
