<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The localizations of the Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early transcriptional activator BZLF1 protein ZEBRA, of the BMRF1 early antigen diffuse component (EA-D), and of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication were studied in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Akata treated with anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompt and sequential appearance of ZEBRA, EA-D, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA was observed in about 70% of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At early times after activation, ZEBRA had a diffuse intranuclear distribution, but later it was concentrated in globular regions within the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EA-D appeared first in a finely stippled pattern and then in a diffuse pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At late times, EA-D concentrated in globular regions similar to those with ZEBRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double staining for ZEBRA and EA-D revealed that ZEBRA followed the morphological changes of EA-D with a 1-2 hr delay and that both finally coalesced in the same structures, where in situ hybridization localized replicating <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The redistribution of both ZEBRA and EA-D to these compartments depended upon the replication of lytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that these globular regions are sites for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication and that transcription of EBV late genes may be regulated in these structures </plain></SENT>
