<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the five MoAbs obtained, MoAb 3w3 showed the highest antibody titer and also best neutralized NT-3 activity as measured by the survival of chick embryonic day-8 dorsal root ganglia neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for NT-3 was established with solid phase MoAb 3W3 and the Fab' fragment of MoAb 3W3 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection limit was 2.7 pg/well of NT-3 and no cross-reactivity with nerve growth factor up to 100 ng/well was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this EIA system we have screened a variety of cell lines for NT-3 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these tested, only human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Namalwa cells were found to be producing NT-3 </plain></SENT>
