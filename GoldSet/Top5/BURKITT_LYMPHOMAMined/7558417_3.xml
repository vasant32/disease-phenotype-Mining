<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The de-regulation is caused through juxtaposition of c-myc with one of the 3 immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reported earlier that treatment of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> causes transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the possible therapeutic implication of this result, we looked for other compounds which, on the one hand, might be applicable in vivo and, on the other hand, might cause down-regulation of c-myc expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> is known to induce differentiation, we have examined other differentiation inducers of different chemical nature for their ability to reduce c-myc expression in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the substances tested caused down-regulation of c-myc expression, which, however, was transient except for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three types of compounds proved to be particularly active: polar planar compounds (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxide</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5686">heterocyclic compounds</z:chebi> (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acids</z:chebi> (e.g., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30772">n-butyric acid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi> on c-myc suppression was exceptional not only in not being transient, but also in being allele-specific: it down-regulated the translocated allele without affecting the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medium transfer experiments revealed that neither degradation of the active compound nor an intracellular resistance mechanism can fully account for the reversibility of c-myc down-regulation after treatment with the transiently acting polar planar compounds </plain></SENT>
