<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown whether these two pathways cooperate in the generation of IFN-alpha responses or function independently, and whether IRS-proteins transduce distinct downstream signals in response to IFNs or insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-mediated activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that in response to IFN-alpha treatment, IRS-1 functions selectively as a docking protein for the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the PI 3'-kinase, but not the SH2 domain of Grb-2 which is engaged during insulin/IGF-1 signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 human myelomonocytic cells and 32D mouse myeloid cells, which are IRS-defective, we found that the IFN-alpha-regulated activation of Stat-1, Stat-2, and Stat-3 does not require the function of the IRS-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells are responsive to the protective effect of IFN-alpha against vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both 32D and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha, but this effect was not reversible by expression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone in 32D cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken altogether these data show that: (1) The IRS-system transduces common and distinct signals in response to IFN-alpha or insulin/lGF-1 stimulation of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The IRS-pathway operates separately from the Stat-pathway, and its function is not essential for the generation of the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Neither the IRS- nor the Stat-pathways alone are sufficient to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha in hematopoietic cells, and additional signaling elements are required </plain></SENT>
