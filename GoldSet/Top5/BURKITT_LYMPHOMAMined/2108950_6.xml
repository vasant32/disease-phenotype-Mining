<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of completely purified native hM-CSF on the tumoricidal activity of human monocytes against Raji (Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line) using a <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of human peripheral blood monocytes with hM-CSF for 48 h markedly enhanced their antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This enhancing effect was dependent on the concentration of hM-CSF, and maximal enhancement was achieved at the concentration of 66 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of receptor sites on monocytes against the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G increased 2- to 4-fold during 48 h incubation with hM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that hM-CSF stimulates monocyte-ADCC by increasing the number of Fc receptor sites on human monocytes </plain></SENT>
