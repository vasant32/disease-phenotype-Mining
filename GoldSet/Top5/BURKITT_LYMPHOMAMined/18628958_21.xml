<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The c-Myc transcription factor is a master regulator and integrates cell proliferation, cell growth and metabolism through activating thousands of target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our identification of direct c-Myc target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis (ChIP-PET) revealed that nucleotide metabolic genes are enriched among c-Myc targets, but the role of Myc in regulating nucleotide metabolic genes has not been comprehensively delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the majority of genes in human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> biosynthesis pathway were induced and directly bound by c-Myc in the P493-6 human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of these genes were also responsive to the ligand-activated Myc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor fusion protein, Myc-ER, in a Myc null rat fibroblast cell line, HO.15 MYC-ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these targets are also responsive to Myc activation in transgenic mouse livers in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the functional significance of c-Myc regulation of nucleotide metabolism, we sought to determine the effect of loss of function of direct Myc targets <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2) on c-Myc-induced cell growth and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this regard, we used a specific IMPDH inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolic acid</z:chebi> (MPA) and found that MPA dramatically inhibits c-Myc-induced P493-6 cell proliferation through S-phase arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate the direct induction of nucleotide metabolic genes by c-Myc in multiple systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding of an S-phase arrest in cells with diminished IMPDH activity suggests that nucleotide pool balance is essential for c-Myc's orchestration of DNA replication, such that uncoupling of these two processes create DNA replication stress and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
