<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the regulation of CD20 expression after treatment with 0.5-2.0 Gy X-irradiation and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>), in the presence or absence of known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, in the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Daudi and Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irradiation of cells enhanced cell-surface CD20 expression; the kinetics and extent of this change were cell-type specific and time-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of reactive oxygen species generation and changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential after irradiation were also correlated with changes in CD20 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raji and Daudi cells treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> showed a 2-to 2.5-fold increase in CD20 expression at 12 and 20 h, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Buthionine sulfoximine, which depletes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, also increased surface CD20, whereas <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-catalase, <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-SOD, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2636">amifostine</z:chebi>, decreased CD20 expression induced by radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>-mediated decrease in CD20 expression induced by radiation or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> suggests a mechanism involving redox regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the critical role of radiation-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in CD20 expression and may have implications for defining and improving the efficacy of CD20-targeted antibody therapy and radioimmunotherapy </plain></SENT>
