<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined deletion and methylation of the p15INK4B (p15) and p16INK4A (p16) genes, using Southern blotting and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in 70 untreated adult patients with precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-ALL) and analysed the relationship between their genetic changes and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation and homozygous deletion of the p15 gene were detected in 30 (43%) and 18 (26%) patients, while those of the p16 gene were found in 16 (23%) and 11 (16%) patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of 17 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p15 gene showed expression of p15 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, whereas 31 out of 39 patients with alteration (deletion and methylation) of the p15 gene showed no p15 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by reverse transcription-PCR, suggesting that alterations of the p15 gene are highly associated with loss of p15 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival (DFS) at 4 years in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p15 gene is 33%, compared with 4% of those with p15 gene alterations (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the absence of p15 gene alterations was an independent significant favourable prognostic factor for longer DFS (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that alterations in the p15 but not p16 gene can be used as a genetic prognostic indicator in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e>-ALL </plain></SENT>
