<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) is currently being used in the treatment of B non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that rituximab triggers and modifies various intracellular signaling pathways in NHL B-cell lines, resulting in reverting the chemoresistant phenotype to a sensitive phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether rituximab also modifies intracellular signaling pathways resulting in the sensitization of NHL cells to Fas-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the Fas-resistant NHL cell lines (2F7, Ramos and Raji) with rituximab sensitized the cells to CH-11 (FasL <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> mAb)-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and synergy was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fas expression was upregulated by rituximab as early as 6 h post-treatment as determined by flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rituximab inhibited both the expression and activity of the transcription repressor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) that negatively regulates Fas transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of YY1 resulted in the upregulation of Fas expression and sensitization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to CH-11-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of YY1 expression was the result of rituximab-induced inhibition of both the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and constitutive nuclear factor kappa of B cells (NF-kappaB) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The involvement of NF-kappaB and YY1 in the regulation of Fas expression was corroborated by the use of Ramos cells with a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-kappaB (Ramos IkappaB-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) mutant) and by silencing YY1 with YY1 siRNA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, the role of rituximab-mediated inhibition of the p38 MAPK/NF-kappaB/YY1 pathway in the regulation of Fas and sensitization to CH-11-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was validated by the use of specific chemical inhibitors of this pathway and which mimicked rituximab-mediated effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a novel mechanism of rituximab-mediated activity by sensitizing NHL cells to Fas-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
