<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that 80% of ALL patients respond to anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs, the patho-<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of this disease is still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression-profiling studies that have been performed have not yet provided novel insights into the mechanisms behind cellular response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More powerful data analysis techniques may be required for identifying novel functional pathways involved in the cellular responses to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In order to explore the possibility that unforeseen biological processes may be involved in the response to DNA damage, we have developed and applied a novel procedure for the identification of functional modules in ALL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have discovered that the overall activity of functional modules integrating protein degradation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> processing is predictive of response to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
