<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 6 days in culture, the lytic properties of the LAK cells were analyzed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assay by utilizing a target panel of 6 paired lines consisting of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell line and an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) from the same donor, the Raji <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line and the natural killer (NK) cell-sensitive K562 line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patterns of lysis showed that the LAK cells discriminated between two categories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I/II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells which expressed the common <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> antigen (CALLA), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigen (BLA) and phenotypically resembled biopsy cells were strongly lysed whereas group III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells which had assumed an LCL-like phenotype during culture and lacked the CALLA and BLA surface markers were only poorly lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LCL targets were generally resistant to lysis but the K562 cell line was particularly sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and monoclonal antibody (MAb) studies indicated that the LAK cell populations were phenotypically and functionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and consisted of at least 2 subpopulations of effector cells; a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific component and an NK-cell-mediated component </plain></SENT>
