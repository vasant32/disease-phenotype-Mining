<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface protein, which is expressed at high density on <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissues and at lower levels on most other solid-organ tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In lymphocytes, its level of expression is dependent upon the state of cell activation, and polyclonal anti-PrP antisera partially block lectin-induced T-cell activation, suggesting a functional role of the protein in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3F4 we examined PrPc surface immunoreactivity on leukaemic cell lines of T- and B-cell origin, and unexpectedly observed a complete lack of PrPc cell-surface expression in Daudi cells, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cell lines displayed discernible reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the intracellular presence of PrP-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PrP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lack of surface PrPc is unrelated to the well-known defect of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) expression in Daudi cells as other beta2m-deficient cells, such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line F0-1 and spleen cells from beta2m gene-deleted mice, were not deficient in cell-surface PrPc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells failed to bind antibodies directed against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GPI-linked cell surface proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In somatic hybridization experiments using murine spleen cells as partners, we observed de novo expression of human PrPc, CD55 and CD59, thus demonstrating in Daudi cells the availability of these gene products for GPI linkage and cell-surface expression </plain></SENT>
