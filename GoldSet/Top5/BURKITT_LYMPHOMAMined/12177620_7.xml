<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) is a major complication after bone marrow and solid organ transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease encompasses a spectrum of abnormal, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B-cell proliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that EBV-infected, spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (SLCL) derived from PTLD patients require autocrine interleukin (IL)-10 to proliferate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine if cytokine signal transduction is involved in the autonomous growth of the SLCL, the activation states of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway proteins were analyzed in three different SLCL, termed JB7, MF4, and VB4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The tyrosine phosphorylation (P-tyr) states of the Janus kinases (Jaks) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated STAT dimer formation was determined by electromobility shift assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three SLCL, but not the Daudi Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line, expressed the four known Jak kinases constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, with particularly high levels of P-tyr Jak1 in the JB7 line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>STAT1 and STAT3, but not STAT2 or STAT5, are also constitutively activated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of the activated STAT proteins to form DNA-binding dimers was confirmed by electromobility shift assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SLCL, but not the Daudi line, express activated STAT complexes composed of STAT1 and STAT3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another EBV-infected B-cell line, isolated from a lymph node biopsy after kidney transplantation, is phenotypically similar to the other SLCL in both surface antigen and activated STAT1 and STAT3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the presence of a constitutively active autocrine signaling pathway consistent with IL-10 in the SLCL </plain></SENT>
