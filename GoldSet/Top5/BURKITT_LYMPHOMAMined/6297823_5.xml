<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> with human lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of virus-producing cells (P3HR-1) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in EBV genome copies per cell as determined by cRNA--DNA hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed in a non-virus-producer line (Raji) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose-response studies indicated that the optimum concentration was between 0.5 micrograms and 2 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This same dose range was most effective in inhibiting cell proliferation both of P3HR-1 and Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant treatment of P3HR-1 cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> gave an additive increase to 9-fold of the number of EBV genome copies per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of Raji cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with P3HR-1 virus resulted in a 35% enhancement of EBV DNA replication as analyzed by density centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Raji cells superinfected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi>-treated EBV showed a marked reduction in EBV DNA replication which indicates that the lesions produced in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome by the drug interferred with the infectious potential of the virus </plain></SENT>
