<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This occurs rapidly and efficiently in response to cross-linking the B-cell receptor on Akata Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After optimizing conditions for induction, signal transduction responses to B-cell receptor cross-linking were observed within 10 min, well before any autoactivation effects of BZLF1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary events in reactivation were shown to involve dephosphorylation of the myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF-2D) transcription factor via the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>-sensitive, calcium-mediated signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This and other signal transduction events were correlated with the quantitative promoter analysis reported in the accompanying paper (U </plain></SENT>
