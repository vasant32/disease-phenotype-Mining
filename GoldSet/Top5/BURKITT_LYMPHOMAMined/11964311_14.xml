<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e>, while liberated from many of the homeostatic constraints placed on physiologic counterparts, can nonetheless remain subject to both social and environmental control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells faithful to the biopsy phenotype were used to model the reliance of the colony, if any, on an inbuilt population sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Below a normally suicidal threshold number of cells, low picomolar quantities of exogenous CD40 ligand (CD40L/CD154) were found to sustain the clone without the discernible shift in phenotype that accompanies high CD40L encounter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although CD154 was undetectable in populous cultures, message was induced as numbers became limiting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, attempts to neutralize endogenous CD40L activity failed to perturb cells at optimal densities but resulted in their marked decline as the critical threshold was approached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data reveal an auto-inducible survival mechanism seemingly regulated through the monitoring of population size, a process somewhat akin to that of "quorum sensing" among <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram-negative</z:mp> bacteria in which diffusible molecules provide a means of communication to coordinate gene expression with population density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This process could be activated as cells discern <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletions</z:mpath> in their community or when deprived of signals otherwise furnished within an appropriate environmental niche </plain></SENT>
