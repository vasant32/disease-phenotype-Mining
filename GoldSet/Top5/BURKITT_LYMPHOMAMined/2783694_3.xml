<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LI were first apparent in Daudi cell cultures 12 h after the addition of 100 units/ml of the purified recombinant human leukocyte interferon, IFLrA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiolabels were added at this time and allowed to incorporate over the following 12 h during which an estimated greater than 99% of the LI material present at 24 h was formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LI-incorporated radiolabels were present only during this discrete 12-h period after the interferon activation of LI cell pathways in order to detect LIs de novo synthesized macromolecular components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimate relative specific activities of the LI-incorporated radiolabels were: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> at 4.042, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> at 2.631, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> at 0.664, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> at 0.578, and amino acids at 0.477 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> the estimated LI specific activity was 0.000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LI isolated from whole cells retained the tubular elements and the interwoven membrane network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide direct evidence that the interferon-induced Daudi cell LI are de novo synthesized complexes of ribonucleoprotein and membrane </plain></SENT>
