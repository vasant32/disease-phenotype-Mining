<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV has been implicated in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as well as in some human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its route of entry into epithelial cells is incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here evidence that there is no gene alteration in the SCR 1 and 2 exons of EBVR/CR2 in human embryonic nasopharyngeal epithelial (HENE) cells and NPC cells and that SCR 1 and 2 mRNA could be detected in HENE cells, different differentiated NPC cell lines and well-differentiated NPC biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of 15 cases of poorly differentiated NPC cryosections has SCR 1 and 2 mRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also provide evidence that transformation of HENE cells results from exposure to infectious EBV and that transformation is dependent on the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that expression of SCR 1 and 2 of EBVR/CR2 may be associated with replication of EBV and support the notion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1707758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">direct infection</z:e> and transformation of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells destined to evolve into the <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> by EBV through EBVR/CR2 </plain></SENT>
