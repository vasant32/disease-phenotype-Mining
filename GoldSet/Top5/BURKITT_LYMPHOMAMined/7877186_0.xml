<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that anti-CD3 McAb and PHA not only enhanced the proliferation of splenocytes induced by IL-2, but also produced synergism if used simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD4 and Tac of cellular surface markers were increased after splenocytes were induced by anti-CD3 McAb and PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of LAK cells suggested that PHA had the capability to promote anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of LAK cells by both direct and indirect pathways, but anti-CD3 McAb indirectly promoted anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of LAK cells by enhancing splenocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
