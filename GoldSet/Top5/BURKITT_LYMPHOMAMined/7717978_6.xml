<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as hSOS is involved in p21ras activation, we also demonstrated that mIgM ligation activated a Ras-dependent kinase cascade in which sequential activation of Raf-1 and MEK-1 culminates in the activation of p42 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK-2) </plain></SENT>
