<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper summarizes the various clinical trials undertaken in Africa over the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The single most effective drug for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given alone for remission induction, CPM is as effective as combinations consisting of either CPM, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (VCR) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) or CPM, VCR and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> (Ara-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival data indicate that single-dose CPM is comparable to multiple doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, maintenance therapy may not be necessary, and may in fact worsen the final outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal (IT) MTX given together with systemic therapy significantly delays central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) relapse, which is not prevented by cerebrospinal irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For established <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease, IT-Ara-C for three days followed by MTX on the fourth day is effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin scarification, while provoking measurable responses in vivo and in vitro, had no measurable, specific anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> reaction, since no effect was observed on relapse rate, duration of remission or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-dose CPM produces objective responses in patients previously resistant to conventional doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Teniposide (VM 26) is currently undergoing phase 2 trial, and definite short-lived responses have been recorded </plain></SENT>
