<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Mex- (Mer-) phenotype of human cells is characterised by a sensitivity to agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi>) and N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-N-nitrosourea (MNU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypersensitivity of Mex- cells is a consequence of their failure to express the DNA-repair enzyme m6-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16235">Gua</z:chebi>-DNA methyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> and MNU may be acquired by Mex- cells either by reexpression of a methyltransferase function or by an ill-defined process of tolerance in which the cytotoxic potential of m6-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16235">Gua</z:chebi> is circumvented without the altered base being removed from DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that tolerance might involve an altered mismatch correcting function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have investigated proteins which recognise and bind specifically to DNA fragments containing single-base mismatches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell-free extracts of a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Raji) contain two such mismatch binding activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither protein appears to have a high affinity for m6-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16235">Gua</z:chebi>-containing base pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that m6-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="16235">Gua</z:chebi>-containing base pairs might be poor substrates for mismatch repair processes in human cells </plain></SENT>
