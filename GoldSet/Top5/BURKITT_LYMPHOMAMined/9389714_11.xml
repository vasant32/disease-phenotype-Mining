<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA was analyzed in serum and plasma samples of patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell specimens as well as serum and plasma samples collected from 110 patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B-precursor lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 54% of serum or plasma samples analyzed at different times before and during treatment, clonal DNA from a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus was detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When examined at diagnosis and before any treatment, clonotypic DNA was found in serum or plasma of 86% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum or plasma from patients with systemic or bulky disease was uniformly PCR positive, whereas clonotypic DNA was also recovered from the serum or plasma from the majority of patients with limited disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Degradation of clonal DNA by nucleases in vitro was shown to be one cause of false-negative PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technical drawback can be relieved by adding a nuclease inhibitor like EDTA, ie, by using plasma instead of serum for PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of patients with cytotoxic drugs was followed by rapid clearance of DNA from the peripheral blood, suggesting that soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA might be associated with viable and proliferating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies showed a close correlation of persisting soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA with resistant disease or early relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA can be detected in serum or plasma of the majority of patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and that testing of serum or plasma for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated DNA may be a novel parameter for monitoring response to treatment </plain></SENT>
