<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently described a colorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH) method for detecting extra copies of the MYC gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> and the frequent occurrence of excess copies of discrete MYC signals in the context of diploidy or <z:mp ids='MP_0004025'>polyploidy</z:mp> of chromosome 8, which correlated with increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We further observed enlarged MYC signals, which were counted as a single gene copy but, by their dimension and unusual shape, likely consisted of "clusters" of MYC genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to further characterize these clusters of MYC signals by determining whether the presence of these correlated with other genetic features, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, protein, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that MYC clusters correlated with an abnormal MYC locus and with increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MYC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> correlated with protein levels, and both increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein correlated with poorer overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MYC clusters were seen in both the germinal center and activated B-cell subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DLBCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clusters of MYC signals may be an underappreciated, but clinically important, feature of aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance </plain></SENT>
