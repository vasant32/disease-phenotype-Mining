<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As conventional cytogenetics may not reveal a neoplastic clone, and unfixed material for fluorescence in situ hybridization may be unavailable, performing fluorescence in situ hybridization on fixed tissues is diagnostically and prognostically valuable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Manual interpretation of fluorescence in situ hybridization signals may be difficult on paraffin-embedded tissue sections due to truncated nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the use of an automated image acquisition and analysis system (MetaSystems) for interpretation of fluorescence in situ hybridization signals in tissue sections from dual fusion translocation probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three probe sets were analyzed on archival specimens with a confirmed diagnosis of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>100% of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (7/7) were positive for t(11;14), 91% of follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (10/11) for t(14;18) and 100% of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (9/9) for t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful hybridization was achieved using various tissue <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50913">fixatives</z:chebi> and fluorescence in situ hybridization interpretation was blinded with respect to the underlying diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, automated analysis of fluorescence in situ hybridization on fixed tissues is accurate and valuable in the evaluation of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and may provide pertinent diagnostic and prognostic information </plain></SENT>
