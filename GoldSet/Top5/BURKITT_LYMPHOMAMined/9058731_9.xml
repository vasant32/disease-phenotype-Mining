<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies showed that such SEA-directed T cells efficiently lysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> B-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next, we made a mutated SEA-protein A (SEAm-PA) fusion protein with more than 1,000-fold reduced binding affinity for MHC class II compared with native SEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fusion protein was successfully used to direct T cells to B-CLL cells coated with different B lineage-directed monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this communication, we constructed a recombinant anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MHC class II binding capacity of the SEA part was drastically reduced by a D227A point mutation, whereas the T-cell activation properties were retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Fab part of the fusion protein displayed a binding affinity for CD19+ cells in the nanomolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm molecule mediated effective, specific, rapid, and perforin-like T-cell lysis of B-CLL cells at low effector to target cell ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CD19+ B cells were sensitive to lysis, whereas CD34+ progenitor cells and monocytes/macrophages were resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A panel of CD19+ B-cell lines representing different B-cell developmental stages were efficiently lysed, and the sensitivity correlated with surface ICAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein mediated highly effective killing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsy cells representing several types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (B-NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Humanized severe combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice carrying Daudi <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were used as an in vivo therapy model for evaluation of the anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Greater than 90% reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> weight was recorded in anti-CD19-Fab-SEAm-treated animals compared with control animals receiving an irrelevant Fab-SEAm fusion protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that MoAb-targeted superantigens (SAgs) may represent a promising approach for T-cell-based therapy of CD19+ B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
