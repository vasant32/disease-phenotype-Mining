<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the expression of the three major known growth transformation-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins, EBNA-1, EBNA-2, and latent membrane protein (LMP), in a series of somatic cell hybrids derived from the fusion of EBV-carrying Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) lines with EBV-positive or EBV-negative B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Independently of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, EBNA-1 was invariably coexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EBV-carrying hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In hybrids between EBV-carrying, LMP-positive and LMP-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, LMP was expressed, indicating positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, Ramos and BJAB, differed in their ability to express LMP after B95-8 virus-induced conversion and after hybridization with Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BJAB was permissive while Ramos was nonpermissive for LMP, although both expressed EBNA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBNA-2-deleted P3HR-1 virus gave the same pattern of LMP expression in these two cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the expression of EBNA-1, EBNA-2, and LMP is regulated by independent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
