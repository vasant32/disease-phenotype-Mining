<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible coupling between the interferon-responsive genes that are directly transactivated by the interferon signaling and the genes that constitute the basic machinery of the cell cycle is not clear yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report in this work that interferon-induced double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-activated kinase (PKR) is one of the specific mediators of the antiproliferative effects of the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfections of M1 myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells with two catalytically inactive mutant forms of PKR abrogated the ability of interferon to suppress c-Myc without interfering with the pRB/cyclin D responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, these genetically manipulated cells displayed a small but significant reduction in their growth sensitivity to interferons, a phenotype that characterizes a single pathway disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the parental M1 cells with the functional <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human PKR restricted their proliferation in the absence of interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This PKR-mediated growth inhibition could be efficiently rescued by the ectopic expression of deregulated c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together these results prove the existence of direct or indirect links between PKR and c-Myc suppression, thereby placing this gene along one of the complementary growth suppressive pathways that are triggered by interferons </plain></SENT>
