<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The oncogene latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) without a ligand drives proliferation of EBV-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its levels vary in cells of clonal populations by more than 100-fold, which leads to multiple distinct activities of the oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At intermediate levels it drives proliferation, and at high levels it inhibits general protein synthesis by inducing phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found that LMP1 activates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> to induce phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, which upregulates activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATF4, in turn, transactivates LMP1's own promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP1 activates not only <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> but also <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and ATF6, 3 pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing expression levels of LMP1 induced a dose-dependent increase in IRE1 activity, as measured by its "splicing" of XBP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These infected B cells secrete immunoglobins independent of the levels of LMP1, indicating that only a threshold level of XBP-1 is required for the secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that LMP1's activation of the UPR is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> event in a continuum of LMP1's expression that leads both to stimulatory and inhibitory functions and regulates the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of EBV-infected B cells in multiple, unexpected modes </plain></SENT>
