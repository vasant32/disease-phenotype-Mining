<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age of the 41 patients was 15 years (range: 9 months - 23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 27 males and 14 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (23/41) were located in the thoracopulmonary region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 31/41 cases there was bone as well as soft tissue involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following histopathological patterns were found: Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>-like (n = 7), atypical Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>-like (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>-like (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo>-like (n = 8), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_241'>hemangiopericytoma</z:mpath>-like (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases combined patterns were noted, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> being characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>-like and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-like features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most cases of MPNT differed from the cytological features of typical Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> in that they contained hyperchromatic nuclei with distinct nucleoli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some reticulin fibrils were found in between the cells of some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, 19/23 cases reacted positively to vimentin, 29/32 to neuron specific enolase (NSE), 16/28 to protein S-100, and 1/9 to glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>12/24 cases reacted positively to NSE and protein S-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurofilaments and desmin were not found in the formalin fixed material of the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show that most cases of MPNT can be distinguished from typical Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> by cytological and histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis from atypical Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> is possible by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
