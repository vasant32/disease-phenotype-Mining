<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A functional role of class II antigen in the binding of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was deduced from the study of membrane proteins on Jijoye, an EBV receptor (EBVR)-positive B cell line, and its mutant, EBVR-negative daughter cell line, P3HR-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled microsomal membrane proteins and immunoprecipitates, we identified class II antigen on Jijoye but not on P3HR-1 cells and the presence of Ii on both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of these molecules in EBVR function was tested by antibody blocking of virus adsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-p23,30 serum (to class II antigen) was found to block binding of EBV to B lymphoblasts under conditions in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit serum, rabbit antiserum to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">butyrate</z:chebi>-treated P3HR-1 cells (with ample anti-Ii antibodies), and rabbit anti-p44,12 (to class I antigen and beta 2-microglobulin) serum did not block virus binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one of four commercial monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to framework <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on class II antigens blocked binding of EBV, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four MoAb demonstrated immunofluorescent reactivity with the EBVR+ Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In previous studies of binding of EBV to hairy leukemic cells, a substantial subpopulation of HLA-DR+, EBVR- cells was identified, in addition to HLA-DR+, EBVR+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with the view that the HLA-DR complex has a role in the binding of EBV but that other components are also needed for the expression of EBVR function </plain></SENT>
