<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 protein can determine whether cells will die via <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or be protected from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reh was found to express a high basal level of Bcl-2 but was lacking of Bax protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with bryostatin 1 induced a down-regulation in Bcl-2 protein that was not accompanied by an obvious Bax protein induction or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a decreased level of Bcl-2 alone in this cell line is not sufficient for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify the mechanism whereby <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could be induced in this ALL model, we treated Reh cells with three microtubule inhibitors: dolastatin 10, auristatin PE and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, in the presence and absence of bryostatin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When used alone, only dolastatin 10 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> that was detected morphologically, and by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots revealed that dolastatin 10-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was accompanied by the induction of Bax protein and the reduction in Bcl-2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Auristatin PE and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> induced both Bax and Bcl-2 protein, leaving the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reh cells pretreated for 24 h with bryostatin 1 followed by dolastatin 10, auristatin PE or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> showed significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> which was accompanied by Bcl-2 protein down regulation and Bax protein up regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that: (1) expression of bax is necessary for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-induction in this model; (2) a decrease in Bcl-2 level alone is not sufficient and might not be necessary for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-induction; and (3) the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 plays a critical role in susceptibility to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Reh cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results from this study should prove useful in guiding the clinical application of these novel agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
