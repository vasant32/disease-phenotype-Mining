<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following this trend, the first chemical synthesis of the gene for rHuTNF-alpha gene in Poland and its subsequent successful expression in E. coli was recently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we verify the in vitro biological activities of this TNF-alpha preparation (CMMS/TNF-alpha) in comparison with a commercially available preparation of TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that our TNF-alpha possesses strong cytotoxic activity against WEHI 164 (clone 13) cells, binds the p55 and p75 TNF receptors on cell lines, induces intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate its usefulness for further investigations as an effective reagent for in vitro assays </plain></SENT>
