<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified a human protein, EBP2, which interacts with the EBNA1 sequences that govern EBV partitioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that, in mitosis, EBP2 localizes to the condensed cellular chromosomes producing a staining pattern that is indistinguishable from that of EBNA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The localization of EBNA1 proteins with mutations in the EBP2 binding region was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An EBNA1 mutant (delta325-376) disrupted for EBP2 binding and segregation function was nuclear but failed to attach to the cellular chromosomes in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that amino acids 325-376 mediate the binding of EBNA1 to mitotic chromosomes and strongly suggest that EBNA1 mediates EBV segregation by attaching to EBP2 on the cellular mitotic chromosomes </plain></SENT>
