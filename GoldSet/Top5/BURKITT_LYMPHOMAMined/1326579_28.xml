<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human CTL have been isolated that show self-restricted recognition of autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines and allorecognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lymphoblastoid cell line ligand most likely used a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that is expressed in EBV-bearing cells when the virus enters the lytic cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is presented to CD8+ CTL by HLA-Cw7 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The allogeneic ligand recognized on non-EBV-infected cells is composed of a class I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and a naturally selected self-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In previous studies we demonstrated that this ligand is determined by two MHC-linked genes: one gene encodes the allogeneic class I molecule whereas the other controls the self-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of different <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and different class I molecules, seemingly equivalent structures are formed that enable these two ligands to function as antigenic mimics of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTL with the same patterns of dual specificity could be isolated from four unrelated donors, indicating that HLA-Cw7 is frequently involved in self-restricted recognition of EBV-harboring cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such CTL could help not only to contain lytic virus during a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> but also may be maintained life-long to eliminate cells in which reactivated virus appears </plain></SENT>
