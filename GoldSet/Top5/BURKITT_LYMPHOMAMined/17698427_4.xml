<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and mass spectrometry have been used to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in cytosolic extracts from four human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>), MEC1 (B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>), CCRF-CEM (T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>) and Raji (B-cell Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 247 differentially expressed proteins were identified between the four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data by principal component analysis identified 22 protein spots (17 different protein species) differentially expressed at more than a 95% variance level between these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several of these proteins were differentially expressed in only one cell line: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 (myeloperoxidase, phosphoprotein 32 family member A, ras related protein Rab-11B, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi>-isomerase, ran-specific GTPase-activating protein, nucleophosmin and S-100 calcium binding protein A4), and Raji (ezrin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several of these proteins were differentially expressed in two cell lines: Raji and MEC1 (C-1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> synthase, elongation factor 2, alpha- and beta-tubulin, transgelin-2 and stathmin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEC1 and CCRF-CEM (gamma-enolase), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 and CCRF-CEM (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed proteins identified in these four cell lines correlate with cellular properties and provide insights into the molecular basis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
