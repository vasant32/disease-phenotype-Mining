<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Here we test whether the targeting of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 to transcriptionally active regions is due to coincidence of the synthesis of these proteins with the replication and assembly of active chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line CA46 were synchronized with mimosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and the protein synthesis rates of HMG-14/-17 were determined at various stages during the S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of HMG-14/-17 was essentially constant throughout this phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The half-life for HMG-14/-17 protein corresponded to the doubling time of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that HMG-14/-17 are synthesized throughout S-phase and persist through the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeting of HMGs to active genes is not simply due to the timing of their synthesis during S phase </plain></SENT>
