<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine interferon-alpha subtypes, IFN-alpha1, IFN-alpha2, IFN-alpha5, IFN-alpha7, IFN-alpha8, IFN-alpha10, IFN-alpha14, IFN-alpha17, and IFN-alpha21, were separated from purified human lymphoblastoid IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested their inhibitory effects on cell growth and replication of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus (VSV) and their induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2', 5'-OAS) in ACHN <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three activities, the nine subtypes had similar relative activities, with IFN-alpha10 the most active and IFN-alpha1 the least </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their relative effects on cell growth were similar in two other human cell lines, SK-LU-1 lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells and KU-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> cells, whereas cells of the Daudi Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line behaved quite differently, being highly sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the nine subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative effects with ACHN cells correlated well with their relative binding affinities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, each of the subtypes bound to both ACHN and Daudi cells to almost the same extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that their profound inhibitory effects on the growth of Daudi cells are amplified at some stage in the signal transduction pathway or in the expression of genes that results from binding to the IFN-alpha receptor </plain></SENT>
