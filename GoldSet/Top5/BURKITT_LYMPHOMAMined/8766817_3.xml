<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding of proteins from an immortalised B-cell line to a panel of SH3 domains was investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the most prominent SH3 domain binding proteins was a 68 kD <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> which strongly associated with the SH3 domains of c-src, p85a and p47phox and weakly with the SH3 domain of PLCgamma and n-src with undetectable binding to the other SH3 domains tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting identified this protein as human Sam68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of proline-rich <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> homologous to the Sam68 primary sequence to inhibit the binding of Sam68 to SH3 domains was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> inhibited binding of Sam68 to the p85alpha SH3 domain, whereas several <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> inhibited binding of Sam68 to c-src SH3 domain, suggesting that Sam68 uses different proline-rich motifs to bind to different SH3 domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> derived from residues 32-44 of Sam68 which fits the class II SH3 domain binding consensus sequence inhibited binding of Sam68 to both p85alpha SH3 domain and c-src SH3 domain, but with differential potency, suggesting a differential affinity of these SH3 domains for this proline-rich motif </plain></SENT>
