<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The virus is harboured for life in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously infected individuals and is apparently controlled by a population of EBV-specific memory T lymphocytes, specifically activated to recognize the functionally defined lymphocyte-detected membrane antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types (A and B) of EBV have been identified that show DNA sequence divergence within the BamH1 WYH region of the genome encoding the transformation-associated antigen, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2) (ref </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To define the function of EBNA 2 in T-cell recognition, we have compared the ability of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell clones to distinguish between autologous B lymphocytes transformed by A- or B-type virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have now isolated both CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T-cell clones that recognize autologous A-type but not B-type transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, thus providing the first evidence that EBV-specific T-cell recognition can be mediated by EBNA 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As this antigen is not expressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, this finding explains the failure of EBV-specific T-cell surveillance to eliminate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
