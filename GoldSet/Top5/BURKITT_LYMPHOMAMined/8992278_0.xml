<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-dehydrogenase activity (LD, EC 1.1.1.27) and its isoenzymes have been evaluated twice (within 12 months) in 11 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> with respect to a control group (30 subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the relationship between those and other clinical and immunologic parameters (total lymphocytes, CD4/CD8, immunoglobulins, classification according to the Atlanta CDC 1987) has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIV infected children have shown a significant decrease in LD1 rates, which was directly correlated to CD4/CD8 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the follow-up, this correlation became even more significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings may suggest the usefulness of LDH isoenzymes evaluation as a marker of disease activity in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
