<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>huIL-4 can induce LAK activity from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with the LAK activity induced by rhuIL-2, the cytotoxicity of the killer cells induced by rhuIL-4 to K562 and Raji cells was lower, but that to <z:chebi fb="12" ids="9509">TBL</z:chebi>-E, a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0005526'>lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> cell line established in our laboratory, and PHA-activated blast cells (PHA-blasts) was of similar magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the cytotoxicity assay using PHA-blasts, the addition of PHA increased the IL-4-induced killer cell cytotoxicity by 131%, but had no effect on IL-2-induced killer cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This implies that IL-4 mainly induces CTL-like activity, while IL-2 mainly induces NK-like activity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of rhuIL-4 was evaluated by injection of human LAK cells induced from PHA-blasts by rhuIL-2+rhuIL-4 and human cytokines into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that human LAK cells effectively inhibit the tumorigenicity of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="9509">TBL</z:chebi>-E cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice with an inhibition rate of 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The antitumor effect of rhuIL-2 was better than that of rIL-4, and the antitumor effect of rhuIL-2+rhuIL-4 was similar to that of rhuIL-2, though the former delayed the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data imply the potential application of human IL-4 in clinic, and provide an animal model to evaluate the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity of human cytokine(s) with species specificity </plain></SENT>
