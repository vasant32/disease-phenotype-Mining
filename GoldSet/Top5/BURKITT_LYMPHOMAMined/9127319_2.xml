<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been a common practice to divide gastrointestinal (GI) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> into Western and Middle Eastern types; the former predominantly involves the stomach, whereas the latter are mostly intestinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggested that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> are biologically different from their nodal counterpart and hence should be classified separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the primary GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> seen at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan, between 1983 and 1992 in an attempt to reclassify and immunophenotype these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 53 cases of primary GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> for which available material was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphomas</z:hpo> were morphologically reclassified according to current classification schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase stains were performed using the streptavidin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method using antibodies against leukocyte common antigen, B, and T-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The stomach was the most common site of involvement, accounting for 62% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 2.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three most common histologic types were, in order, diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021071" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IPSID">Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease</z:e> was seen in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> predominated in our cases; it was seen in 85% of the gastric and 100% of the intestinal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unlike other series from the region, the stomach was the most commonly involved site by GI <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021071" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IPSID">Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease</z:e> seems to be a rare entity in Jordan, and the majority of intestinal and gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic evidence of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue origin was seen in at least 18% of the gastric cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were by far the most common type seen, and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were rare </plain></SENT>
