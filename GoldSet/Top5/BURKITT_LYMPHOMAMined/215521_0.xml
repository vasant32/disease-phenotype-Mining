<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of MA, VCA and EA was completely blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A marked reduction in the frequency of MA-positive cells was observed in the infected cell cultures in the presence of either Ara-C or PA, but a fraction of the MA-positive cells was insensitive to the inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differential absorption of an EBV antibody-positive human serum with Ara-C-treated or -untreated infected cells revealed two antigenically different components of MA: early (Ara-C-insensitive) and late (Ara-C-sensitive) MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of five sera from patients with NPC, but none of five sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults, showed an apparent 'prozone' phenomenon in their reactivity against late but not early MA </plain></SENT>
