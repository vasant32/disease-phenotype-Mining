<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One V-J junction was sequenced and an anti-junctional oligonucleotide synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This oligonucleotide was used as probe on in vitro amplified DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that this strategy allows the detection of the corresponding clonal DNA at dilutions of up to 10(6) fold in germline DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover we demonstrate that it is possible to differentiate this clone from the second leukemic clone and from polyclonal T-cells </plain></SENT>
