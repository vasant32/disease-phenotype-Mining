<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stereochemistry of these compounds was established by means of NMR spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antiproliferative activity was determined in a panel of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines (CCRF-CEM, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, HeLa, ZR-75-1, HT-29, and MEXF 276L) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generally, the new compounds were found to be more potent (IC50 = 0.011-0.436 microM) than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> (IC50 = 140 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the compounds exhibited the highest activity against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with an IC50 of 0.011-0.035 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">Cytidine</z:chebi> incorporation into DNA was quantitated for selected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38532">hydrazones</z:chebi> (Z-A, E-1, Z-3, Z-4, E-5, Z-5, E-13, E-18, Z-19, Z-24, and E-26) as a measure of the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26561">ribonucleotide</z:chebi> reductase in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E-configurated compounds were found to inhibit [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi> incorporation to a greater extent (IC50 = 0.67-5.05 microM) than the Z-isomers (IC50 = 7.20 to &gt; 10 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis of the IC50 values obtained for inhibition of cell proliferation revealed that the cell lines tested can be grouped into three main families showing different sensitivities toward the compounds in our series [(i) CCRF-CEM, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and Hela; (ii) HT-29; and (iii) MEXF 276 L] </plain></SENT>
