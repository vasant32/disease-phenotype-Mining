<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sequence of HuBlym-1 has been reported but it has not been established whether the sequence of the transforming gene differs from that of the gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, as might be expected from the common observation of mutational activation of proto-oncogenes into oncogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I report here that there are no differences between the sequences of three recombinant DNA clones that were isolated from Burkitt's cell lines and that cross-hybridize to HuBlym-1 but do not induce foci when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, and the reported sequence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Blym </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also there is no obvious or consistent increase in the transcription of the HuBlym-1 gene in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines of the type that might otherwise have accounted for its transforming activity even in the absence of a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>How the HuBlym-1 gene is activated therefore remains a mystery </plain></SENT>
