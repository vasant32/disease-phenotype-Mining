<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiometal-labeled antibodies provide higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> radiation doses than corresponding 1311 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>67Cu has an exceptional combination of properties desirable for radioimmunotherapy, including gamma and beta emissions for imaging and therapy, respectively, a biocompatible half-time and absence of pathways contributing to myelotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radioimmunoconjugate, 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1, has been shown to be efficacious in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji) xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, a clinical study of the pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with advanced stage 3 or 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were given a preload dose of unmodified Lym-1, then an imaging dose of 126-533 MBq (3.4-14.4 mCi) 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total Lym-1 ranged from 25 to 70 mg dependent on the specific activity of the radioimmunoconjugate and was infused at a rate of 0.5-1 mg/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Imaging, physical examination, including caliper measurement of superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and analysis of blood, urine and fecal samples were performed for a period of 6-13 d after infusion to assess pharmacokinetics, radiation dosimetry, toxicity and <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 7 patients, in whom superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had been accurately measured, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> regressed from 18% to 75% (mean 48%) within several days of 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The uptake and biological half-time of 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were greater than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, except the mean liver half-time exceeded the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> half-time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-marrow radiation ratio was 32:1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-total body was 24:1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-liver was 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Images were of very good quality; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organs were readily identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mild and transient Lym-1 toxicity occurred in 6 patients; 1 patient developed a human antimouse antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in blood counts or serum chemistries indicative of radiation toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the long residence time of 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, high therapeutic ratios were achieved and, remarkably, numerous <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regressions</z:mp> were observed after imaging doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results indicate considerable therapeutic potential for 67Cu-21T-BAT-Lym-1 </plain></SENT>
