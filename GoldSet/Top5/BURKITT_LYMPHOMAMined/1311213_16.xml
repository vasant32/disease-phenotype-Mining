<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the biologic relevance of the morphologic distinctions between subtypes of small noncleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (SNCL), ie, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's type (sBT) and the non-Burkitt's type (nBT), we have examined the molecular organization of several lymphomagenic oncogenes (c-myc, bcl-1, bcl-2) and the potential pathogenetic contribution of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine cases of SNCL, not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndromes, were reviewed and classified as sBT (18 cases) or nBT (11 cases) without knowledge of the clinical or molecular data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis of 18 sBTs found 17 to contain c-myc rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these comigrated with an Ig heavy-chain gene segment, indicating t(8;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 8 breakpoints were clustered in the first exon and the first intron of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 14 breakpoints mapped to the JH locus in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the S mu locus in nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and the S alpha locus in the remaining three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases involving the S alpha locus appeared to have a more rapid clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sBTs possessed germline bcl-2 and bcl-1 gene fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Southern blot analysis of 11 nBTs found none with c-myc rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather, three of 10 evaluable nBTs had bcl-2 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining seven showed no evidence of involvement by any of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-associated oncogene/breakpoint regions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EBV genome was detected in two sBTs and in one nBT, and thus was not a distinguishing feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the subtle histologic differences that distinguish subcategories of SNCL are significant biologically and reflect distinct molecular mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data suggest that the nBTs comprise a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group with respect to their molecular genetic composition and confirm the remarkable molecular genetic homogeneity of the sBT group </plain></SENT>
