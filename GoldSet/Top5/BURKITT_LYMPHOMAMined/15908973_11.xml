<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown the efficacy of a humanized CD20 antibody (rituximab) for treatment of CD20+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> together with conventional chemotherapy but less is known about its post transplant usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the ability of rituximab to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) with effector cells and complement from patients who were transplanted with T-cell-depleted grafts from unrelated or mismatched related donors </plain></SENT>
