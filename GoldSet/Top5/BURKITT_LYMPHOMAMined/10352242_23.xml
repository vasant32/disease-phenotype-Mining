<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical use of IFN-alpha/beta encompasses treatment for a variety of diseases; however, prolonged exposure to IFN-alpha/beta results in elevated levels of autoreactive Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the potential of IFNs to modulate apoptotic signals in B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that IFN-alpha or IFN-beta inhibit Ag receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3' (PI3)-kinase did not abolish the effect of IFN, indicating that the antiapoptotic mechanism is PI3-kinase- and protein kinase B/Akt-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma, significantly increase the levels of the survival protein Bcl-2, and to a lesser extent, Bcl-xL expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, IFN-alpha/beta-mediated inhibition of B cell Ag receptor-triggered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may offer a model for the process that leads to the escape of self-reactive B cells from negative selection and consequently results in autoantibody production </plain></SENT>
