<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work the EBV-NPC cell interaction has been analyzed at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction-based amplification to detect specific latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four transplantable NPC cell lines studied and 17 of 18 fresh snap-frozen NPC biopsy specimens expressed an EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with a BamHI Q/U/K splice structure exactly like that recently identified in group I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines and shown to be driven from a novel <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoter, Fp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BamHI Y3/U/K-spliced EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> characteristic of virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) was never found in NPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These same NPC biopsy specimens were then analyzed for evidence of the various LMP transcripts which are constitutively expressed in LCLs but down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While only 3 of 18 tumors gave a clear LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-specific signal after first-round amplification with either of two sets of polymerase chain reaction primers, the majority proved to be LMP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> positive after second-round amplification with nested primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rather similar pattern of results was obtained with respect to LMP2B <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, such transcripts being detectable only in a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and then at apparently low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, clear evidence of LMP2A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was obtained in 17 of 17 fresh biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predominant form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in NPCs, with coexpression of EBNA1 and LMP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, is therefore quite distinct from that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells (in which EBNA1 is the only expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and in LCL cells (in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six EBNA and three LMP transcripts are present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This third form of EBV latency may not be restricted to NPC but may have more general relevance in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
