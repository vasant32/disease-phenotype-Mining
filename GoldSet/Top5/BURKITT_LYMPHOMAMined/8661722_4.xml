<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is regulated, in part, by the pRB-family proteins, pRB and p107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis for this regulation is due to a network of interactions between the pRB-family proteins, pRB, p107, and p130; the E2F-family of transcription factors; and cyclins D, E, and A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the pRB-family proteins, p107, has also been found to bind to the transactivation domain of the c-Myc proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This region in c-Myc is frequently mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of p107 and regulation of c-Myc may conceivably be disrupted not only by mutations in c-Myc, but possibly by mutations in p107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to determine if mutations in p107 are indeed present in mouse B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> which exhibit a lower frequency of c-Myc mutation, we have cloned the mouse p107 cDNA and compared this sequence with its human counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find that the extreme N-terminal and C-terminal regions are the most conserved between human and mouse p107 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal positioning of the locus for p107 (designated Rbl1) as well as E2f1 to the distal end of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 2 also suggests a close but unlinked genetic relationship between these cell cycle regulatory transcription factors </plain></SENT>
