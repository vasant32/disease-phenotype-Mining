<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concern over missing the rare unsuspected, significant diagnosis propagates this practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Careful gross examination for asymmetry and clinical findings should obviate the need for routine microscopic examination of tonsil and adenoid specimens in patients age 21 years and younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was conducted using the SNOMED database of 4070 patients age 21 years or younger who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy between 1970 and July 2001 at the University of Florida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of the study group was 0 to 5 years (52%), 6 to 12 years (37%), and 13 to 21 years (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens consisted of tonsils only (15%), tonsils and adenoids (40%), and adenoids only (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant diagnoses were diagnoses that impacted the care of patients and included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-clinically significant diagnoses included <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo>, and tonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant pathological processes were seen in the tonsil or adenoid specimens of 3 of the 4070 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 3 cases included a 2-year-old male with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a 19-year-old male with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (small noncleaved cell, non-Burkitt's type), and an 11-year-old male with a probable <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> process but in whom a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> could not be absolutely excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, microscopic examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> routine tonsils and adenoids for individuals 21 years or younger is not indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gross examination is still recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion and specimen asymmetry should be used to determine when thorough histological examination is merited </plain></SENT>
