<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly purified preparations of ricin A chain or ricin B chain were separately coupled to anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies and the conjugates (immunotoxins) were affinity purified to eliminate free chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of anti-Ig-A and anti-Ig-B immunotoxins markedly synergized in vitro in their ability to kill the Ig-bearing human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, A-chain- or B-chain-containing immunotoxins of irrelevant specificity did not synergize with anti-Ig-A or anti-Ig-B immunotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that free A or B chains do not play a major role in the synergy and that the synergy is specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, synergy depends on the specificity of the two antibodies; the lectin binding ability of a B-chain-containing immunotoxin of irrelevant specificity does not suffice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach of delivering ricin A chain and B chain separately to a target cell may have significant advantages in killing cells that are not effectively killed by A-chain-containing immunotoxins alone </plain></SENT>
