<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When cAMP formation in response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of the A2-type (stimulating) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor is measured in the same cell lines there is no correlation with the expression of ecto-nucleotidases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and LCL cell lines derived from the same donor, an inverse relationship between ecto-nucleotidases and the response to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> N-ethyl-carboxamido-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (NECA) is observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells which exhibit both 5'-N and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor with specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against the enzyme does not impair the function of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antisera against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the membrane antigen BNLF I-MA, coded by the EBV-genome, do not co-precipitate 5'-N out of detergent extracts of LCL-cells </plain></SENT>
