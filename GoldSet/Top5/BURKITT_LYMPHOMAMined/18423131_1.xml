<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical characteristics are different between the endemic areas in Africa and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> areas in America and Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no large-scale report concerning Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in China yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was to summarize the characteristics of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of 69 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, treated from May 1985 to May 2007 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center of Sun Yat-sen University, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, 44 were men and 25 were women, with a median age of 7 (range, 2-72); 5 were at stage I, 9 at stage II, 21 at stage III, and 34 at stage IV, advanced stage (stages III and IV) accounted for 55 (79.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abdomen (63.8%), cervical lymph nodes (68.1%) and faciomaxillary-oropharynx (34.8%) were the most common involved sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (21.9%) and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (17.4%) could also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B symptoms were found in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level was elevated in 42 of 58 patients, while serum <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> level was elevated in 13 of 56 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was found in 6 of 57 patients, Epstain-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 7 of 13 patients, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 0 of 51 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Short-term and high intensive chemotherapy with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system prophylaxis could improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics of these 69 Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients are much similar to those from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> areas, but the median age is lower, and the most common involved sites are cervical lymph nodes, abdomen and faciomaxillary-oropharynx </plain></SENT>
