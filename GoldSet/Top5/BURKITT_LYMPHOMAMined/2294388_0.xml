Lineage fidelity has been challenged by the demonstration of lineage switching or mixed-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a 7 year old male who presented with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and nasopharyngeal and cervical masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His blasts had the morphologic appearance of myeloblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026998" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">FAB M1</z:e>) and were positive solely for the myeloid antigen CD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He entered a complete remission (CR) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At first relapse he had evidence of mixed-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with B-cell lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He again relapsed from a second CR with Burkitt-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic findings showed a consistent 14q+, 17p+ abnormality in the blasts and nasopharyngeal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The t(8;14) associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found in the mass tissue only following passage in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our patient demonstrates that limitations still exist in our ability to classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That leukemic transformation occurred in a multipotential progenitor cell leading to undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis and/or that chemotherapy can influence the genetic programs of leukemic cells leading to the evidence of mixed-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and lineage switching is supported </plain></SENT>
