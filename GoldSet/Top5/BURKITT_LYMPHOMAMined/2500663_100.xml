<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately 80% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> of the B-cell lineage carry only one or two immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements indicating their clonal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements due to the recombination of various variable, diversity, and joining regions of the heavy-chain gene segments during B-cell commitment result in a region called complementarity-determining region III (CDR-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This region, which encompasses the diversity region of the heavy-chain segment, because of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo>, provides a DNA-encoded signature specific for each B-cell clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CDR-III sequences were obtained from DNA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004812'>pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> by using suitable primers and the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sequences were used to generate diagnostic probes that hybridized only to the amplified CDR-III of leukemic cells from which the sequences were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With these probes, leukemic cells could be detected when diluted 1:10,000 with other cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By cloning the amplified CDR-III into recombinant libraries residual leukemic cells were accurately quantitated in bone-marrow samples from repeated relapses and remissions in one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a clinical remission lasting greater than 7 mo, malignant cells were present in marrow at greater than 1 per 1000 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that custom-made diagnostic probes will be useful in accurate quantitation of malignant cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients in clinical remission and will allow investigation of the biological significance of low or high numbers of residual leukemic cells in evolution of that disease </plain></SENT>
