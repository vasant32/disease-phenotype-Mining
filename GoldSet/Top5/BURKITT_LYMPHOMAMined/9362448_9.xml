<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 can inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by a variety of stimuli, including radiation and its presence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells would be expected to indicate poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, however, are often low-grade and highly responsive to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this apparent paradox, we analysed in vitro the responses of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells to gamma-irradiation in the presence and absence of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-level expression of Bcl-2 was shown to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell survival following irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a significant proportion of Bcl-2-rescued cells subsequently underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after an extended period in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, Bcl-2 was found either to promote or to inhibit long-term proliferative activity following gamma-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This differential regulation of proliferation correlated both with differential effects of Bcl-2 on the cell cycle and with differences in p53 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, by one week after irradiation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells expressing only <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p53 (wt/wt) had arrested in G1, whereas those with a mutant allele (wt/mu) were arrested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Bcl-2-rescued cells that subsequently underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was reduced by ligation of CD40 at the time of irradiation in wt/wt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, but not in wt/mu cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD40-ligation reduced both G1-arrest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, whilst Bcl-2 can delay <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells following gamma-irradiation, the protein can also cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth-arrest</z:mpath> and thereby promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival following Bcl-2-mediated rescue of gamma-irradiated cells may depend on p53 status and require additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-repressing or growth-promoting signals </plain></SENT>
