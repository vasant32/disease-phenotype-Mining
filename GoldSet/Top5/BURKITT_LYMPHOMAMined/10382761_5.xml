<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Co-clustering of the type II receptors binding the Fc part of IgG (FcgammaRIIb) and B cell receptors results in the translocation of cytosolic, negative regulatory molecules to the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (P-ITIM) of the FcgammaRIIb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHP-1 and SHP-2), and the polyphosphoinositol 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) have been reported earlier to bind to murine FcgammaRIIb P-ITIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither the functional substrates of these enzymes, nor the mechanism of the inhibition are fully resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that the human FcgammaRIIb binds SHP-2 when co-clustered with the B cell receptors, whereas its synthetic P-ITIM <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> bindes SHP-2 and SHIP in lysates of the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The P-ITIM <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding enhances SHP-2 activity, resulting in dephosphorylation and release of P-ITIM-bound SHIP and Shc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, P-ITIM-bound SHP-2 dephosphorylates synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> corresponding to the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on SHIP and Shc, indicating that these proteins are its potential substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus SHP-2-induced dephosphorylation may modulate the intracellular localization and/or activity of SHIP and Shc, thereby inhibiting further activation pathways which they mediate </plain></SENT>
