<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal exchanges between chromosomal region 3q27 and three loci of the Ig genes have been reported in cases of B-cell type non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have cloned a region containing a breakpoint junction of 3q27 from a cell line established from a patient with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> carrying t(3;22)(q27;q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region cloned was shown to contain an Ig lambda light chain gene fused to a gene on chromosome 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This finding was subsequently confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extra <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> were present at the joining site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heptamer-like and nonamer-like sequences separated by an intervening 24 bp were present in the region corresponding to the breakpoint of 3q27, suggesting that a misrecombination in Ig gene rearrangement may be involved in the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis with a 3q27-specific probe showed rearrangements in three additional patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> with the t(3;14)(q27;q32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breakpoints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases clustered within a limited 3-kb region on chromosome 3q27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The region of 3q27 involved in the translocation was designated as the BCL5 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transcripts from the BCL5 locus were detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and hematopoietic cell lines, and the increased expression of transcript of aberrant size was detected in the established cell line carrying t(3;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that a gene located at 3q27 is involved in the translocation and that its deregulation plays a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> of B cells </plain></SENT>
