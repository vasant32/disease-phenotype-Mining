<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the uptake and clearance characteristics of 99mTc tetrofosmin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>99mTc sestamibi was also evaluated for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines (U-937: monocyte-like, histiocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, human; RAMOS: B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, American Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, lymphoblastoid, human; Hs445: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, lymphoid, human) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After incubation of radiotracers 99mTc tetrofosmin and 99mTc sestamibi in medium for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min, the uptake and clearance of each radiotracer were measured in the three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The uptake of 99mTc tetrofosmin was lower than that of 99mTc sestamibi in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the three cell lines, Hs445 showed the greatest 99mTc tetrofosmin uptake capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RAMOS and U-937 showed similar 99mTc tetrofosmin uptake capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>99mTc tetrofosmin accumulated in the three tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, especially in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in comparison with 99mTc sestamibi, 99mTc tetrofosmin may not be the best radiotracer for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
