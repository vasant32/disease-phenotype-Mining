<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the similarity in properties between this 62-kDa protein and p62(Dok-1), the possibility that these two proteins are identical was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of a constitutively active form of Tec in a pro-B cell line induced the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous Dok-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tec also associated with Dok-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in 293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tec mediated marked phosphorylation of Dok-1 both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect required both the Tec homology and Src homology 2 domains of Tec in addition to its kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of Dok-1 in 293 cells induced inhibition of Ras activity, suggesting that Dok-1 is a negative regulator of Ras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the immature B cell line Ramos, cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-1, and this effect was markedly inhibited by expression of dominant negative mutants of Tec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of Dok-1 inhibited activation of the c-fos promoter induced by stimulation of the BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Tec is an important mediator of signaling from the BCR to Dok-1 </plain></SENT>
