<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 60 cases were confirmed in those aged below 15 years with a majority (38.3%) of the children under 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern shows a preponderance of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> and soft tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> as the commonest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A low relative frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (8.3%) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumours</z:e> were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This pattern closely resembles that of other Nigerian reports but contrasts with the situation in Britain and America, with their high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumour</z:e> frequency ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Generally, there appears to be a low prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> among children in Calabar and presumably the south-eastern part of Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Difficulties in their management are attributable to late presentation, high patient default rate, complete lack of radiotherapy, and shortage of chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
