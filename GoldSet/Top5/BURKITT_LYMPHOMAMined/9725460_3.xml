<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were fixed and permeabilized with Fix &amp; Perm cell permeabilization kit at room temperature for 15 min each, and stained with anti-MPO monoclonal antibody (MPO-7) by direct immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One myeloid cell line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, was MPO-positive, while the other myeloid cell lines (KG-1, K-562, and MEG-01) as well as lymphoid cell lines (KM-3, NALM-6, Raji, REH, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>-1) were MPO-negative as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, MPO was detected in 23 of 26 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), 7 of 23 cases of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), 1 of 6 cases of T-lineage ALL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>), and 1 of 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensity of MPO expression in 6 of 7 B-lineage ALL cases was weak compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable cytochemical MPO in the cells of ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> that stained negative for anti-MPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relationship between the expression of MPO and myeloid lineage surface antigens was observed in ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases of MPO-positive ALL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AUL</z:e> could be reclassified as biphenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> according to the revised Catovsky scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that anti-MPO is an excellent marker for the diagnosis and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and can be reliably detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This rapid technique should be a valuable addition to routine immunophenotyping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
