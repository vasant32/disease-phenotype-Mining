<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TGF-alpha shows sequence homology with epidermal growth factor and competes with epidermal growth factor for binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor, stimulating the phosphorylation of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TGF-alpha is secreted by many transformed cells and may be involved in embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cloned human TGF-alpha gene was used to map the locus for the TGF-alpha precursor to the short arm of human chromosome 2, region 2p11----2p13, by Southern blotting techniques with DNA prepared from rodent X human somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These hybrids contained different subsets of human chromosomes and included a set with a translocation between human chromosomes 1 and 2 [t(1;2) (q32;q13)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization of the TGF-alpha probe to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human metaphase spreads confirmed these data and localized TGF-alpha more precisely to bands 2p11----2p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints in the variant Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> translocation t(2;8) occur within these bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such a t(2;8) translocation could place TGF-alpha next to c-myc in band 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possibility is raised that TGF-alpha might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in these cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
