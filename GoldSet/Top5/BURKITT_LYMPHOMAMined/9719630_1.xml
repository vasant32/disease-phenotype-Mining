<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that EBV-infected marmoset lymphocytes do not form <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice following ip injection, while human lymphocytes infected with the same EBV strains do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the assumption that the EBV-infected marmoset cells were lacking a factor necessary for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation, we transfected a plasmid containing c-myc into EBV-infected marmoset cells (B95-8, FF41, and W91 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite expression of the c-myc protein as determined by immunoblot and flow cytometry when probed with a monoclonal antibody, no increase over baseline lesion development was seen in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice inoculated with 5 x 10(6) c-myc-expressing marmoset lymphoblastoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, cells that express c-myc and harbor EBV are not sufficient to form <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in certain immunocompromised hosts </plain></SENT>
