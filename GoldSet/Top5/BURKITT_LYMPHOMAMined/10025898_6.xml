<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the strong in vitro activity of some immunotoxins (ITs), clinical application did not result in complete cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome of therapy may be improved by combining ITs with IT-cytotoxicity enhancing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of various agents that influence the intracellular routing of ITs on the activity of the anti-B cell IT CD22-recombinant (rec) ricin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In protein synthesis inhibition assays the carboxylic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophores</z:chebi> monensin and nigericin enhanced the activity of the IT 117- and 382-fold, respectively, against the cell line Daudi, and 81- and 318-fold, respectively, against the cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IT activity to Daudi and Ramos was enhanced to a lesser extent by the lysosomotropic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> (14- and 11-fold, respectively) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> (nine- and 10-fold, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> induced more than an additive effect (145- and 107-fold, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was not influenced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35553">perhexiline</z:chebi> maleate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28669">Bacitracin</z:chebi> enhanced the IT cytotoxicity in contrast to the other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> aprotinin, leupeptin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, albeit enhancement was weak (two-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The enhancers exerted only a negligible effect on bone marrow progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recently developed a flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay in which cell elimination can be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to detect enhancement in this assay, we used 5 x 10(-11) M IT (approximately the 50% protein synthesis inhibiting dose (ID50)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This concentration killed 41% of the Daudi cells and 42% of the Ramos cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the presence of 10 nM monensin the IT killed 74% and 99% and in the presence of 10 nM nigericin 96% and 99% of the Daudi and Ramos cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 10(-8) M, CD22-rec ricin A eliminated malignant cells originating from three patients with B-CLL (0.42 log) and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> (0.19 log) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity to malignant cells was enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>, monensin and nigericin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> enhanced the activity most effectively (up to 2.06 log) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To determine the applicability of the IT in combination with enhancers in vivo we investigated the effect of human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Human serum inhibited IT activity which could not be restored by monensin and nigericin because of complete inhibition of these enhancers by serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> partially restored the activity of CD22-rec ricin A in the presence of human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We conclude that monensin, nigericin and the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> can be used instead of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31206">NH4Cl</z:chebi> to potentiate CD22-rec ricin A activity in purging autologous bone marrow transplants contaminated with malignant B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">Chloroquine</z:chebi> might be a promising enhancer of CD22-rec ricin A for treating patients in vivo </plain></SENT>
