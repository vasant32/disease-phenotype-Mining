<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic subgroups comprised 78.9% B-precursor cell, 15.1% T-cell, 2.0% B-cell, and 4% infant ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with B-progenitor cell ALL were stratified by age and leukocyte count and randomized to receive induction therapy comprised of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and asparaginase with triple intrathecal chemotherapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi>), followed by intensification with moderate-dose MTX (Regimen A), moderate-dose MTX plus asparaginase (Regimen B), moderate-dose MTX plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> given early (Regimen C), or moderate-dose MTX plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> given over the first 16 months of therapy (Regimen D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuation therapy comprised <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50667">mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system preventive treatment was continued for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with T-cell or B-cell ALL or infants less than 1 yr old were treated on individual very intensive multiagent therapy protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4-year event-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 66.4% +/- 2.4%; B-precursor ALL approximately 72%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> approximately 50%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> approximately 60%, and infants less than 1 yr old approximately 16.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that about two-thirds of newly diagnosed children with ALL can be cured with this approach which spares the majority of children exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi>, epipodophylotoxins, and irradiation, diminishing the risks of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and late effects </plain></SENT>
