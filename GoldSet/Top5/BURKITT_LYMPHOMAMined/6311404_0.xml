<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus complement-fixing antigen and its application to the demonstration of Epstein-Barr virus association in nonproducer lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on competition for complement between Epstein-Barr complement-fixing antigen and its specific antibody and a probe complex composed of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and specific anti-beta-galactosidase antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This competitive enzyme immunoassay is a specific and sensitive procedure for detecting Epstein-Barr virus association in nonproducer cell lines, allowing also quantitative estimation of the amount of antigen produced </plain></SENT>
