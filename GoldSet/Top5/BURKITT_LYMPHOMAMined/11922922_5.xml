<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infections</z:e> has been the method of choice, and tests are available as indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA)- and ELISA-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ELISA-based EBV assay from Wampole Laboratories (Cranbury, NJ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifty-two consecutive samples received for comprehensive EBV serology were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A comparison of the Wampole Laboratories' ELISA system with the Gull/Meridian Diagnostics (Cincinnati, OH) IFA, and ELISA assays showed 88% concordance for anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) IgM (n=177); 79% concordance for anti-VCA IgG (n=177); 87% concordance for anti-NA IgG (n=172); and 48% concordance for anti-EA IgG (n=165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four antibody assays to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the Wampole system had a 67% concordance with the Gull/Meridian (n=164) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the specificity of the anti-EA IgG assays (i.e. reactivity against the D component of early antigen (EA-D) (Wampole) vs. reactivity to EA-D and the R component of early antigen (EA-R) (Gull/Meridian)) may have lead to poor concordance (48%) for this particular assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the Wampole system had a &lt;70% overall concordance with the Gull/Meridian system in diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, these data suggest that further studies are needed to determine the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of this system </plain></SENT>
