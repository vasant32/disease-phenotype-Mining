<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>International experts in the field (discussed herein) shared their experiences in exploring the role of a variety of biologic markers related to different types of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (follicular, diffuse large B-cell, mantle cell, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>) as well as Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The final goal of this clinical research is to develop new biologic prognostic indices for these major subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years, various prognostic indices, mainly based on clinical characteristics of the patient at diagnosis, have served to determine the prognostic profile and to develop prognostic factor-based treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it is now time to reconsider this based on the wealth of new biologic information directly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and the surrounding cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this workshop, organized by the European School of Hematology and the European Hematology Association, the latest developments on molecular pathogenesis, new biomarkers, and their relation to prognosis were extensively discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, the major conclusions presented in the different sessions are summarized </plain></SENT>
