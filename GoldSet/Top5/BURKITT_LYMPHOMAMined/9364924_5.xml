<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species are organized in elongated structures, whereas others appear as dot-like concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the status of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> within these accumulations, we investigated the composition of accumulations derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes, human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus 18 (HPV18) open reading frames E6 and E7, as well as heat shock protein 89a (hsp89alpha) and 89beta (hsp89beta) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differential distribution of exon and intron sequences within concentrations of EBV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas accumulations of hsp89alpha and hsp89beta always coincided with Sm antigen foci, the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of EBV and HPV18 never co-localized with these foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This excludes Sm antigen foci as the only sites of splicing and suggests gene-specific variation in the nuclear localization of transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two sets of experiments were performed to assess whether transcripts in the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> accumulations are in statu nascendi or products released from a discrete gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts derived from EBV genes, which are located on both ends of the genome, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distributed along the entire length of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> signals, they cannot be derived from a highly decondensed genomic DNA extending throughout elongated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> accumulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, removal of labeled <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequences and subsequent visualization of DNA confirmed the confinement of the genomic sequences to a small subregion of the area occupied by accumulated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study supports the view of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> accumulations as a stream of molecules that delineate a path from a dot-like gene locus toward the nuclear envelope for export into the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
