<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hybrid cells exhibiting heterofluorescence were isolated in a cell sorter (FACS III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were cloned and analyzed for both Raji and K562 derived antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hybrid cells retained the excellent growth behaviour of AB5 cells while expressing also Raji antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the hybrids (BD7) was used for trioma production when fused with human stimulated spleen cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trioma cells representing a fusion product of three parental cells may be useful for studying problems of gene regulation and expression </plain></SENT>
