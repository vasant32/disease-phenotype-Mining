<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosed in children (&lt; 15 years) in the section of histopathology at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi during the period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: These consecutive cases were evaluated on H&amp;E stained sections and then immunohistochemistry analysis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was performed by employing Peroxidase Anti-Peroxidase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The present series included 61 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NHL was more common in males as compared to females with male to female ratio of 5.8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High grade NHL comprised 87% of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mode of presentation in majority of NHL (57%) was extranodal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (33%) was the most prevalent histological subtypes, followed by lymphoblastic (28%), diffuse large cell (15%), diffuse mix small and large cell (13%), small non cleaved Non-Burkitt's (7%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis of the childhood Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> revealed that 67% of the Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are B-cell type while 33%, are those of T-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NHL was more common in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Majority of NHL in children were high grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was the most frequent histological subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>T-cell NHL comprised a significant portion of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
