<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The proto-oncogene c-fgr is expressed in transformed human B lymphoid cell lines and has been reported to be induced in cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have compared the levels of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in several B cell lines and have examined the effects of interferon-induced changes in growth rate of Daudi cells on the concentration of this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels were found in exponentially growing EBV-positive Raji and Daudi cells but the amounts in B95-8 and P3HR-1 cells (also EBV-positive) were lower than in the EBV-negative cell line Ramos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth inhibition of Daudi cells by interferon-alpha is preceded by a reduction in c-fgr expression, with a 56% decrease observed within 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The differences in the amounts of c-fgr <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the various cell lines and in control versus interferon-treated cells are similar to the differences in the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> contents of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that c-fgr expression bears little relationship to the EBV status of B lymphoid cell lines but may play a role, in conjunction with c-myc expression, in growth regulation by interferons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other conditions which influence Daudi cell proliferation, such as treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> or growth to high cell density, also inhibit c-fgr expression but to a lesser extent than interferon treatment </plain></SENT>
