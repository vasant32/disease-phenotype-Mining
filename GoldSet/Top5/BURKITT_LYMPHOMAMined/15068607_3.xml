<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibodies BU12 and HD37, both of the IgG1 subclass, recognize CD19, an internalizing B-lineage-specific membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and member of the Ig supergene family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were readily labeled with 90Y using the highly stable chelate, 1B4M-MX-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radioimmunoconjugates selectively bound to the CD19 expressing B cell line Daudi, but not to CD19 negative control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more 90Y anti-CD19 bound to Daudi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> growing in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice than did a control non-binding antibody (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biodistribution data correlated with an anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity was dose dependent and the best results were observed in mice receiving a single dose of approximately 300 uCi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-CD19 antibody had significantly better anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity as compared to a control 90Y-labeled antibody and most mice survived over 119 days with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology studies showed no significant injury to the kidney, liver, or small intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because radiolabeled anti-CD19 antibody can be used to deliver radiation selectively to lymphohematopoietic tissue, these data support the use of 90Y anti-CD19 antibodies in treating B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
