<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Titers of the IgM antibodies were higher in the earlier stages of IM, a pattern similar to that for IgM antibodies to VCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IgM antibodies to the cell surface were identified as being those against the EBV-specific membrane antigen (MA) by the following criteria: (1) The antibodies were reactive to MA-positive cell preparations but to MA-negative cell preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Titers of the IgM antibodies were not significantly affected after absorption of sera with sheep red blood cells which could completely eliminate heterophil antibodies in the same sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection of the IgM antibodies to MA may have a particular diagnostic value for providing evidence of a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
