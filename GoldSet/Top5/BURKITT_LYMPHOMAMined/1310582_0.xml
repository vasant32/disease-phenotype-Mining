<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both V-araU and BV-araU effectively inhibited EBV replication in virus-producer P3HR-1(LS) cells, as determined by DNA-DNA hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 50% effective doses (ED50) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication were 0.005 and 0.3 microM for V-araU and BV-araU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vitro therapeutic index was 4000 for V-araU and 1300 for BV-araU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synthesis of EBV-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with molecular weights of 145,000 (145, 140, 130, and 110 kDa) was significantly inhibited by both drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only V-araU inhibited the synthesis of 85-, 55-, and 32-kDa <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> by approx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of inhibition and reversibility of EBV DNA replication after removal of the drugs indicated that BV-araU has a more prolonged inhibitory effect than V-araU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the substitution of H by Br in the 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37603">vinyl group</z:chebi> results in marked reduction in anti-EBV activity while prolonging the drug effect and diminishing cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
