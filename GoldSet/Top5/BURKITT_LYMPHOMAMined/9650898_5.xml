<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Africa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal cancer</z:e> (NPC) in Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-coded DNA was found to be present in epithelial elements of NPC, and is usually associated with non-keratinizing (WHO type II) or undifferentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (WHO type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional analyses of EBV genome expression in NPC demonstrate an activated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> state in some of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, leading to elevated levels of serum anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> capsid antigen (VCA) antibody in NPC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients with histological diagnoses of NPC according to the 1978 WHO classification were referred to the Department of Radiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> at Chang-Hua Christian Hospital for curative radiotherapy from 1985 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were staged according to the AJCC staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean dose of 7,020 cGy in 39 fractions was delivered to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> using a telecobalt-60 unit or 6-10 MV X-ray linear accelerator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postradiotherapy serum levels of anti-EBV/VCA IgG and IgA were determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients using the indirect immunoperoxidase assay (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was done to determine which factors affected the patients' treatment outcome and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients were excluded from this study due to incomplete radiotherapy, leaving 75 patients eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall local control was 77.3%, with a mean disease-free interval of 19.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factors affecting local control included radiation dose and pretreatment anti-EBV/VCA IgG titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year actuarial survival for the 75 patients was 75%, with a median survival of 129.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival rates for stage I + II, III, and IV patients were 90%, 40%, and 45%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors for survival included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histological type and pretreatment anti-EBV/VCA IgA titer, while prognostic factors for local control included total radiation dose received and pretreatment anti-EBV/VCA IgG titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that there was a significant difference in the geometric mean titer of anti-EBV/VCA IgA antibodies before and after radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors affecting NPC patients' actuarial survival included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and pretreatment IgA titer, while prognostic factors for local control of NPC included total radiation dose received and pretreatment IgG titer </plain></SENT>
