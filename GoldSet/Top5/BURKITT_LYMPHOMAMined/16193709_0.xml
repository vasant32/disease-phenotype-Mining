<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, high titles of anti-VCA antibodies are observed in EBV-associated neoplasic disorders, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was the development and optimization of P3HR1 cell slides for the EBV serologic detection by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P3HR1 exponential growth culture cells were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi>-12-mirystoil-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, collected at different time points and used for slide preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IIF assay was performed in each slide using an anti-EBV positive serum as primary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An 11% increase in VCA expression was observed at 40 hours post-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data was confirmed by Western blot and immunodetection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intra- and inter-lot precisions of the developed slides were evaluated for IgG and IgM antibodies using EBV-positive sera and positive samples for other members of the Herpesviridae family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither false-positive or false negative results were obtained for EBV detection nor cross-reaction was observed with other members of the Herpesviridae family with the developed slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the slides here presented can be a useful instrument for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> diagnosis and for the serologic detection of IgG anti-VCA antibodies in EBV-associated neoplastic disorders </plain></SENT>
