<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike adults with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, children typically have extranodal disseminated disease of high grade (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of treating children in the Czech Republic with B-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> according to very intensive protocols based on the German Berlin Frankfurt Munster (BFM) NHL 90 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatments are divided in the BFM studies according to "B" and "non-B" immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors report only those treated according to the BFM B-cell protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 1991 through 1997 eighty-two patients less than 18 years with NHL were admitted to the department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three of them were classified as B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 54 were thus eligible for the BFM B-cell treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The entire group consisted of 38 males and 16 females (ratio 2.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age was 11.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve had stage I disease, 3 stage II, 30 stage III, and 9 stage IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 21 patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 29 with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, of which 5 were patients with MALT <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases B-cell NHL was not further classified and one child had a mediastinal B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients were further stratified according to clinical stage and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therapy consisted of a prephase and short (2, 4, or 6 courses), intensive 5-day therapy with 6 drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The probability of event-free survival (pEFS) for the entire group was 74% and overall survival at 5 years was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly better outcome for children classified as stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the EFS of stage III and IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Four patients died from treatment-related complications in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Treatment results were not identical between NHL subtypes, with large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients doing significantly better (pEFS 90%, p = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The use of protocols based on BFM 90 study was feasible at this center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The treatment results are approximately 10% lower than those reported by BFM investigators, but comparable to results from other centers </plain></SENT>
