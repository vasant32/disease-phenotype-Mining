<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lenalidomide and pomalidomide have both been evaluated clinically for their properties as anticancer agents, with lenalidomide being available commercially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that both compounds cause cell cycle arrest in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines by increasing the level of p21(WAF-1) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for p21(WAF-1) up-regulation using Namalwa cells as a human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that the increase of p21(WAF-1) expression is regulated at the transcriptional level through a mechanism independent of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of approaches, we show that several GC-rich binding transcription factors are involved in pomalidomide-mediated up-regulation of p21(WAF-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we report that p21(WAF-1) up-regulation is associated with a switch from methylated to acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 on p21(WAF-1) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) silencing reduced both pomalidomide and lenalidomide up-regulation of p21(WAF-1), suggesting that this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> demethylase is involved in the priming of the p21(WAF-1) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, we propose a model in which pomalidomide and lenalidomide modify the chromatin structure of the p21(WAF-1) promoter through demethylation and acetylation of H3K9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect, mediated via LSD1, provides GC-rich binding transcription factors better access to DNA, followed by recruitment of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II and transcription activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results provide new insights on the mechanism of action of pomalidomide and lenalidomide in the regulation of gene transcription, imply possible efficacy in p53 mutated and deleted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and suggest new potential clinical uses as an epigenetic therapy </plain></SENT>
