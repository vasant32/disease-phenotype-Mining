<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Raji and Daudi cells were opsonized with C3b, iC3b, and C3d fragments by using purified complement components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of C3-opsonized cells to lysis mediated by low density blood lymphocytes was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji and Daudi cells carrying C3b or C3d fragments were lysed with similar efficiencies as the nonopsonized cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of iC3b on the target surface imposed elevated NK sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The iC3b-mediated enhancement of NK lysis was inhibited when iC3b fragments or rabbit anti-human C3 antibodies were included into the lytic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the iC3b fragments fixed on the targets bind to the CR3 on the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results obtained in immobilized conjugate-lytic assays showed that iC3b-opsonized targets interact more readily with the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was reflected by the elevated proportion of lymphocytes that were bound to the iC3b-carrying targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of conjugates in which target damage occurred were similar with the control and with the iC3b-carrying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems therefore that opsonization of targets with iC3b leads to recruitment of effector lymphocytes due to contact with their CR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, once the effector-target contact is established, the triggering of lytic function does not seem to be influenced by the iC3b/CR3 bridge </plain></SENT>
