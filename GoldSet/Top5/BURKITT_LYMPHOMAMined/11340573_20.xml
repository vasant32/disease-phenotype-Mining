<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> was based and confirmed on review of pathological material from time of original diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HIV serology was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were identified during the 5-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 17 (59%) were males, 12 (41%) were females, and the median age was 26 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall survival of HIV-seropositive cases was significantly worse than that of the HIV-seronegative cases; median survival in the HIV-seropositive patients was 15 weeks </plain></SENT>
