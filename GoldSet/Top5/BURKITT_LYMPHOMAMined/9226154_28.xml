<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of efficient B7 family (B7-1/CD80; B7-2/CD86) -mediated costimulation has been shown to be a major defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells' capacity to function as antigen-presenting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here the generation of autologous anti-pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific cytolytic T-cell lines from the marrows of 10 of 15 patients with pre-B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-cell costimulation via CD28 is an absolute requirement for the generation of these autologous cytolytic T cells (CTL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although costimulation could be delivered by either bystander B7 transfectants or professional antigen-presenting cells (indirect costimulation), optimal priming and CTL expansion required that the costimulatory signal was expressed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell (direct costimulation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These anti-pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific CTL lysed both unstimulated and CD40-stimulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells from each patient studied but did not lyse either K562 or CD40-stimulated allogeneic B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytolysis was mediated by the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by CD8+ T cells via the perforin-granzyme pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although we were able to generate anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific CTL from the bone marrow, we were unable to generate such CTL from the peripheral blood of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies show that antigen-specific CTL can be generated from the bone marrow of patients with pre-B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and these findings should facilitate the design of adoptive T-cell-mediated immunotherapy trials for the treatment of patients with B-cell precursor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
