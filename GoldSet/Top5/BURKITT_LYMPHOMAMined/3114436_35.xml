<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have been able to detect soluble interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) in pretreatment sera from 80 patients with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (predominantly Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of IL-2R in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines by immunoprecipitation and direct staining indicates that IL-2R is synthesized by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with two other subject groups: 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> patients and 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of soluble IL-2R values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients (geometric mean, 1,132 U/mL) was significantly greater than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> patients (geometric mean, 332 U/mL; P = .0001) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (geometric mean, 238 U/mL; P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> stages B, C, and D had significantly higher soluble IL-2R values (geometric mean, 1,648 U/mL) than stages A and AR (geometric mean, 706 U/mL; P = .0001) or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (geometric mean, 826 U/mL; P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> group, the soluble IL-2R level was found to be the most significant prognostic indicator of disease-free interval and survival when compared with other previously recognized factors such as histology, stage, bone marrow involvement at presentation, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA), and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No factor was significantly associated with response to therapy, ie, the initial achievement of complete remission (CR) status, although small numbers of patients with a partial response limit interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Soluble IL-2R levels were measured serially in two patients and were found to be elevated at presentation or relapse and to decrease to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels during periods of disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-2R appears to reflect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and may prove to be a useful and specific marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
