<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), dot blotting, and direct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> sequencing were used to assess ras gene activation in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0007716'>uveal melanomas</z:hpo> for three candidate genes: c-Ha-ras1, c-Ki-ras2, and N-ras at codons 12, 13, and 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of 49 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0007716'>uveal melanomas</z:hpo> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amplifiable high molecular weight DNA was obtained from 39 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of regions centering on three candidate ras genes was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR-amplified DNA was evaluated by dot blot and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> sequencing utilizing standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No point mutations were identified in screening the c-Ha-ras gene nor were any genetic alterations found in the c-Ki-ras2 gene at codons 12 and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> sequences were found at codon 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No ras mutations were detected in any <z:hpo ids='HP_0007716'>uveal melanomas</z:hpo> studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to support an association between ras protooncogene mutations and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0007716'>uveal melanomas</z:hpo> at codons 12, 13, or 61 </plain></SENT>
