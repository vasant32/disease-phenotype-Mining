<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells that vary in their phenotypic characteristics show significantly different degrees of susceptibility to radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Propensity to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is reflected in the degradation of substrates such as DNA-dependent protein kinase but the status of bcl-2, c-myc and p53 has been uninformative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have focused on 2 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated Burkitt's cell lines, one (WW2) susceptible and the other (BL29) resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in expression of BHRF1, an EBV gene that is homologous to the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene and known to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, or changes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitory proteins (IAPs), did not appear to account for the difference in susceptibility in the 2 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic extracts from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-treated WW2 cells caused apoptotic changes in nuclei isolated from either BL29 or WW2 cells, whereas extracts from BL29 cells failed to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, extracts from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>-treated WW2 cells degraded the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), an important indicator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but this protein was resistant to degradation by BL29 extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears likely that caspase 3 (CPP32) is involved in this degradation since it was activated only in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> susceptible cells and the pattern of cleavage of DNA-PKcs was similar to that reported previously with recombinant caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As observed previously, addition of caspase 3 to nuclei failed to induce morphological changes indicative of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but addition of caspase 3 to nuclei in the presence of extract from the resistant cells led to apoptotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in BL29 cells is due to a failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> to activate upstream effectors of caspase activity </plain></SENT>
