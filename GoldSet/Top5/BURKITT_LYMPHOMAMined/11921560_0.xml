<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search was made for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> histopathologic diagnosis of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from the files of the department for the years 1988-1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathologic diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was grouped according to Rye's classification and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> according to the working formulation for clinical usage classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were tabulated and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The department of pathology of Gondar College of Medical Sciences; the only unit which provides histopathologic services for the region, that includes Amhara and Tigrai region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases diagnosed at the department were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 83 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were diagnosed over a period of 11 years (1988-1999) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged from four years to 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty one (25.3%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's diseases</z:e>, 61(73.5%) non Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and one (1.2%) unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The commonest type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> were lymphocyte predominant (38%) and mixed cellularity (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nodular sclerosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was diagnosed in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The commonest type of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (41.0%) followed by low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (32.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was diagnosed in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> was high in the first and second decades while non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed high frequency in the fifth decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has shown many similarities in proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and age and sex distribution of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The identified minor differences such as frequencies of histologic patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and paucity of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> deserve explanation and invites prospective studies </plain></SENT>
