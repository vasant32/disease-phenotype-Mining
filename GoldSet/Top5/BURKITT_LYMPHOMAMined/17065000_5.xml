<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> between 1990 - 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to two different chemotherapy approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group A received a protocol which was adapted from the German multi-center study group for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (GMALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group B received a conventional CHOP-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group A (n = 20), significantly more patients achieved complete remission (75% vs 40%, P = 0.02) than in group B (n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-year survival in group A was 65% compared to 44% in group B (P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multi-variable Cox regression analysis, treatment according to the GMALL protocol was significantly associated with prolonged survival with a relative hazard rate of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 - 0.63, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the short and intensive GMALL protocol for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>/NHL is feasible in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
