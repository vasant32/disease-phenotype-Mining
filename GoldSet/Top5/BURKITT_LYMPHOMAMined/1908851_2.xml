<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequence obtained from the stored slide was compared with that of DNA from a frozen lymph node biopsied at the initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequences were shown to be identical, implying that DNA from a smear on a stored slide can be used as a source of DNA for PCR amplification, sequencing, and development of a clone-specific probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using oligonucleotides generated from one of the CDRIII sequences of the IgH gene as molecular probes, a retrospective study for the malignant clone on the smears was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Malignant cells were detectable in the peripheral blood at an early stage of bone marrow relapse but not in the peripheral blood or bone marrow at the initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No malignant clone was detected in the bone marrow when testicular infiltration was diagnosed by examination of a pathological specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the technique permits molecular analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> of B-cell lineage in cases where fresh or frozen specimens are not available </plain></SENT>
