<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of numerous studies, HLA-G is also expressed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> and involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of HLA-G gene regulation differ from those of classical HLA class I genes and involve epigenetic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide additional evidence on the influence of DNA demethylation on HLA-G activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyze the 5' regulatory region of HLA-G in 2 cellular models, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> (FON, M8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> (JEG-3, JAR), either expressing HLA-G transcripts or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data strongly suggest that HLA-G is silenced as a result of CpG site hypermethylation within a 5' regulatory region encompassing 450 bp upstream of the start codon, whereas it is activated upon demethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result correlates with the acetylation status of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> within this region and the putative locus control region located at -1.2 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>cis-acting epigenetic changes and the fact that demethylating agents activate HLA-G expression at least 5 days following treatment should be taken into account in epigenetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
