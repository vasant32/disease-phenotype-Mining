<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that three of four lymphoblastoid cell lines (ADD, IM-9, W1) secreted TNF-beta and expressed TNF receptors, whereas one pre-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and six Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines had no detectable TNF secretion and, except for one Burkitt's cell line (LOU), very low expression of TNF receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When IM-9, W1 or LOU cells were cultured over seven days in the presence of either TNF-alpha or antiserum to TNF-beta there was no difference between their growth rate, endogenous TNF-beta secretion or immunoglobulin secretion compared to untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that TNF does not have a universal role as an autocrine growth factor in transformed B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
