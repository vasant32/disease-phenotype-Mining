<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were 77-year-old female and 34-year-old male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and the other with rupture of spleen on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leukemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> revealed a typical L3 profile by FAB classification system in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunologic analysis showed the presence of surface immunoglobulins in both cases, and one phenotype was IgM kappa, whereas the other was IgG kappa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic study revealed the typical translocations (8; 14) in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved in one case, but the other died 36 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including our two cases, we studied 12 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and 77 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> reported in Japan, investigating the clinical prognosis as well as the biological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that there are no significant difference of survival between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We estimated it is due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> from the same original cell in despite of the difference in main <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site between two diseases </plain></SENT>
