<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated the impact of an intensified post-remission therapy using a high-dose chemotherapy course followed by allogeneic or autologous SCT on the outcome of 58 patients with t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 (E2A group, n=24) or t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 (MLL group, n=34) treated in the LALA-94 multicenter prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in the MLL group had higher WBC counts and more frequent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CR rates achieved by MLL and E2A groups were similar to other B-cell ALL (87, 82 and 86% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While in CR, patients with a donor were assigned to alloSCT (n=22), the remaining patients with were randomized between autoSCT (n=15) or chemotherapy (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year overall survival was 31 and 45% for E2A and MLL groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, DFS was higher in the alloSCT arm as compared to autoSCT and chemotherapy arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that chemotherapy intensification did not overcome the poor prognosis of adults with t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic SCT should thus be offered in first CR to patients with t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 or t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New therapeutic approaches are needed for patients without donor </plain></SENT>
