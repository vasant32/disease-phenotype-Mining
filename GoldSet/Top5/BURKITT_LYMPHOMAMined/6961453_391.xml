<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using a DNA probe that is specific for the complete gene (c-myc), different somatic cell hybrids possessing varying numbers of human chromosomes were analyzed by the Southern blotting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the human c-myc gene is located on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of hybrids between rodent cells and human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells, which carry a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14, allowed the mapping of the human c-myc gene on region (q24 leads to qter) of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This chromosomal region is translocated to either human chromosome 2, 14, or 22 in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
