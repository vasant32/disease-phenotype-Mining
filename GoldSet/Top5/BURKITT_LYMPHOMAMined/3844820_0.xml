<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, the overly simple concepts that certain underlying diseases predispose patients to specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> can no longer be uniformly applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, while Hodgkin's patients were once thought to have cell-mediated immune defects, we now know that mixed T- and B-cell abnormalities as well as alterations in complement and phagocytic processes are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can expect to find infecting organisms against which several immune functions appear to be important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The more common organisms found in these patients include the encapsulated bacteria and fungi, intracellular microbes such as the mycobacteria and certain viruses, and, finally, some protozoa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many are prevalent in the environment and some are considered to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human microbial flora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These opportunistic pathogens will continue to cause serious, often fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in this group of compromised patients until more is known about the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> and significant advances in immunotherapy are made </plain></SENT>
