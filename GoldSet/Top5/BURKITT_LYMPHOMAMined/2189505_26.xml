<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the proliferation-inducing effects of human recombinant interleukin-7 (IL-7) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is shown that IL-7 stimulates DNA synthesis in ALL cells of B-cell precursor (n = 5) as well as immature T-cell origin (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of the cells of four patients proliferating in IL7-supplemented cultures established the leukemic descendence of the IL-7-responsive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>125I-IL-7 binding experiments with the cells of one patient and with two ALL cell lines showed the presence of two types of IL-7 receptors: one with a high affinity (kd 29 to 51 pmol/L) and one with a low affinity (kd 2.3 to 76 nmol/L) for the ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IL-7 is one of the cytokines involved in the complex regulation of ALL cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
