<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we have characterized the cell surface interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor in HepG2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that HepG2 cells bind both IL-1 alpha and beta with high affinity, KDs of 136 and 180 pM and receptor densities of 16,000 and 8500 binding sites/cell respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding sites appeared to be predominantly type II since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> treatment of the cells, which selectively downregulates type II IL-1 receptors, reduced binding by 68% while treatment of the cells with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for the type I receptor had no significant effect on IL-1 binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Competition studies with a modified IL-1 beta analog (Glu4) also revealed binding kinetics more consistent with binding to type II receptors than to type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crosslinking and ligand blotting with human 125I-IL-1 demonstrated the presence of two bands, a 78 kDa band typical of crosslinking to type II (p60) receptor, and a 98 kDa band, typical of crosslinking to the type I (p80) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low level expression of the type I receptor was consistent with molecular biological studies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification which indicated that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the type I receptor was produced by the HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional receptors were demonstrated by the induction of IL-8 by IL-1 stimulated cells </plain></SENT>
