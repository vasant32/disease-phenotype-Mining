<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two closely related genes coding for NELL proteins (NELL1 and NELL2) have been cloned by the yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library with the regulatory domain of protein kinase C betaI (PKCbetaI) as bait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rat NELL proteins show about 55% identity with each other and contain several protein motifs assigned to a secretion signal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, an NH(2)-terminal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-like module, five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor C domains, and six epidermal growth factor-like domains; the NELL proteins share many protein motifs with TSP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NELL proteins expressed in COS-7 cells are homotrimeric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> and possess <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while NELL1 and NELL2 show distinct subcellular localization in cytoplasm, they both are partially secreted into the culture medium of COS-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the NELL1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is faintly expressed in adult neural cells, the NELL2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed abundantly, particularly in the pyramidal cells of rat hippocampus, showing neuronal high plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During mouse embryogenesis, expression of the NELL2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is initiated 7-11 days postcoitum, simultaneously with neural plate formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the NELL2 protein, similar to but not identical with TSP-1, is involved in the growth and differentiation of neural cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the NELL1 and NELL2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were found to be expressed abundantly in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Raji cells and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> SW480 cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is likely that the NELL proteins also participate in the growth, differentiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
