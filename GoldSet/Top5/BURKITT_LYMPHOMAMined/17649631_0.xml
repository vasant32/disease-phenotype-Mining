<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anticancer effects and molecular mechanism of deguelin on human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells in vitro and compare the cytotoxicity of deguelin on Daudi cells and human peripheral blood monocular cells (HPBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of deguelin on the growth of Daudi cells were studied by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5 diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed through Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin V/PI double-labeled cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of deguelin on the cell cycle of Daudi cells was studied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of cyclin D1 and pRb were checked by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proliferation of Daudi cells was decreased in deguelin-treated group with a 24 h IC50 value of 51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>55 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deguelin induced Daudi cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daudi cells treated with deguelin showed an increase of G0/G1 phase and decrease of S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Daudi cells treated with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 nmol/L deguelin for 24 h, showed an increased Go/G, phase from 37.34% to 56.56% , whereas decreased S phase from 37.72% to 21.36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PBMC was less sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of deguelin than Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of cyclin D1 and pRb protein were decreased in Daudi cells treated with deguelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deguelin can inhibit the proliferation of Daudi cells by regulating the cell cycle that arrest cells at G0/G1 phase and inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, deguelin demonstrats low toxicity in PBMC but selectively induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The antitumor effects of deguelin may be related to down-regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 and pRb protein </plain></SENT>
