<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A child who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) associated with an 8;14 chromosome translocation and with a pre-B phenotype is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The leukemic cells were determined to be pre-B-cells on the basis of intracytoplasmic mu-chain immunoglobulin (cIgM+) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common-ALL</z:e> antigen, lack of receptors for sheep erythrocytes, and lack of surface immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 8;14 translocation is frequently found in patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in most patients with B-cell ALL and is known to carry a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus far, no karyotypes have been reported for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B-ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present case indicates that a 14q+ chromosome may provide a proliferative advantage not only to cells with a B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, but also to pre-B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The short survival of our patient also suggests that the 14q+ abnormality and the pre-B phenotype may signal a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
