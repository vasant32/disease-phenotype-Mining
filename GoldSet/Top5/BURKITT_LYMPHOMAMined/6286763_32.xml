<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of an investigation of the cellular origins of undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of the Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's types, we have examined immunoglobulin secretion by cell lines and biopsy samples from these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and have compared it with other lymphoblastoid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and a smaller fraction of African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines secreted monoclonal IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No other Ig classes were secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ig secretion by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples was also found to be exclusively IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secreted IgM was polymeric and associated with J chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secretion of free light chain by most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitation by immunoassay demonstrated that the American <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines secreted significantly more IgM than the African <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have proposed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells represent an early stage of B cell differentiation, during which antigen-independent secretion occurs </plain></SENT>
