<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a histological diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were included provided the final surgical histology reports as well as the biopsy reports were available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>Squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (SCCA) with a peak age incidence in the 6th decade of life and a male to female ratio of 1.65 to 1 was the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (42.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males with SCCA (mean = 48.7 years) were relatively younger than females (mean = 58.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen percent of patients with SCCA were below 40 years at presentation and males were predominantly affected at a ratio of 5.2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Majority of the SCCA (75%) were well/moderately well differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients below 40 years, 45.9% had poorly differentiated SCCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Most commonly affected sites for SCCA were the maxillary antrum (36.7%), mandibular gingiva/ alveolus (23.0%) and tongue (12.04%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented with antral SCCA were relatively younger (mean = 48.9 years) than those who had SCCA involving the mandibular gingiva/ alveolus (mean = 57.1 years) as well as floor of mouth (mean = 56.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, males with antral SCCA were younger than their female counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, males who had mandibular gingiva/ alveolus SCCA (mean = 48.4 years) were younger than their female counterparts (mean = 62.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Majority of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>glandular carcinomas</z:mp> (GLDCAs) arose from minor salivary glands (63.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty seven per cent of these patients were below 40 years at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Females who had antral GLDCA (mean = 32.4 years) were relatively younger than their male counterparts (mean = 49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> were below 40 years (77.4%) and males were younger (22 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of orofacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that is SCCA in Nigerians is relatively low because of a relatively high proportion of GLDCA and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A relatively high proportion of patients with SCCA were below 40 years at presentation </plain></SENT>
