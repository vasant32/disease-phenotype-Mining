<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The members of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein family, pRb, p107 and pRb2 (p130), are central players in controlling the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas disturbed function of pRb is commonly seen in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, it is still an open question whether pRb2 is involved in tumorigenic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, altered subcellular localization of pRb2 and mutations in the pRb2-encoding gene RBL2 have been described for some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, including Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrieved 51 biopsy specimens of endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases from Uganda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of pRb2 was determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exons 1922 of the RBL2 gene, the region known to contain a nuclear localization signal, were screened for mutations by PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our cases (84.0%) were positive for pRb2 protein expression although this protein is a marker for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is characterized by a high proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the positive cases, 73.8% were scored as expressing the protein at a high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subcellular pRb2 localization was predominantly nuclear and no cases with expression restricted to the cytoplasm were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any RBL2 mutations in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal end of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases from Uganda express pRb2, but somatic RBL2 mutations affecting the protein's nuclear localization signal appear to be rare </plain></SENT>
