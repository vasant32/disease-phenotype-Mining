<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five (52%) of patients with initial complete remission relapsed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> over an observation period ranging from 2 years to over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relapse was more common in patients who initially presented with abdominal or central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement than in patients who presented with localized facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anatomical distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> on relapse differed from that at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Facial bones were much less frequently involved on relapse; on the other hand, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, cranial nerves, orbits and skin were frequent sites of disease on relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement occurred in 42% (19/45) of patients at the first relapse and in 73% (11/15) of patients with multiple relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognosis in these patients was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two relapse types were clinically identifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early relapse (remission duration less than 12 weeks) was associated with frequent involvement of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, drug resistance and a generally unfavourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with late relapse (remission duration greater than 12 weeks) responded much better to secondary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible pathogenic mechanisms underlying these two relapse types are discussed </plain></SENT>
