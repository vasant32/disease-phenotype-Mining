<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A monoclonal antibody, referred to as 38.13, was obtained by fusing murine <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells with Lewis rat splenocytes sensitized with Daudi cells (human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> containing Epstein--Barr virus genome but lacking HLA-A, -B, and -C and beta 2-microglobulin molecules at the cell surface) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>38.13 antibody was demonstrated to be a rat IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By complement-dependent microcytotoxicity and indirect immunofluorescence assays, 38.13 antibody was shown to react specifically with cells derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumors</z:e>, including both Epstein--Barr virus genome-carrying and Epstein--Barr virus-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Epstein--Barr virus-containing lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes were not recognized by 38.13 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fresh malignant cells from patients affected with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> were negative, except 4/8 having abdominal Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes from peripheral blood, spleen, lymph node, tonsil, and bone marrow and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, and concanavalin A)-activated blasts were also negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, 38.13 antibody apparently recognized a Burkitt-associated antigen that is not related to Epstein--Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of reactivity of 38.13 antibody with various Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells appeared quite heterogenous and some Burkitt cells were consistently negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>38.13 antibody thus defines a subset of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
