<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has rarely been seen in indolent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report for the first time on 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL) with t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed as having typical CLL (case 1) and CLL/prolymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (case 2), respectively, based on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic analysis of the bone marrow cells using the R-banding technique revealed a karyotype of 47,XY, t(2;8)(p12;q24), +4,[17]/46, XY[9] in case 1 and a karyotype of 45,X, t(Y;7)(q12;q21),t(2;8)(p12; q24),del(12)(p12),-17[5]/46,XY[9] in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T(2;8) translocation was confirmed by whole chromosome painting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the MYC gene and loss of one p53 allele were detected by FISH only in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both cases had negative ZAP70 and CD38 expressions; however, only case 1 showed good response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider that MYC rearrangement, loss of one p53 allele as well as other factors, such as more prolymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow and complex chromosome abnormalities, also had adverse effects on the poorer prognosis of case 2 </plain></SENT>
