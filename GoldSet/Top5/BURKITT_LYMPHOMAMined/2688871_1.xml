<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present investigation demonstrates that leukoregulin, a cytokine secreted by natural killer (NK) lymphocytes up-regulates the sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been previously established that leukoregulin increases the sensitivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> cells were treated with leukoregulin for 1 h at 37 degrees C and tested for sensitivity to NK and LAK cytotoxicity in a 4-h <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi>-release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NK-resistant Daudi, QGU and C4-1 human cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells became sensitive to NK cytotoxicity after leukoregulin treatment, and their sensitivity to LAK was increased two- to sixfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Y-79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> cells, which are moderately sensitive to NK and very sensitive to LAK, became increasingly sensitive (two- to four-fold) to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), recombinant interleukin-1 (alpha and beta), recombinant interferon gamma, recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor or combinations of the latter two failed to up-regulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell sensitivity to NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with recombinant interferon gamma for 16-18 h, GM-CSF and interleukin-1 beta for 1 h induced a state of target cell resistance to both NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leukoregulin may have an important physiological function in modulating NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity by increasing the sensitivity of target cells to these natural cellular immunocytotoxicity mechanisms </plain></SENT>
