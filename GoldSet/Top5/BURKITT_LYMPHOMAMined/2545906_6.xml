<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two species of EBNA-1 (68 and 70 kilodaltons) were identified in nuclear extracts of the EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji and not in nuclear extracts of the EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line BJAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both EBNA-1s bound specifically to the region required for EBV plasmid DNA maintenance (oriP) located in the BamHI-C fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, which activates latent EBV genome in Raji cells, the 68-kilodalton EBNA-1 was uncoupled from binding to EBV oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear extracts from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated BJAB cells also uncoupled the binding of both EBNA-1s to oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA-cellulose column chromatography identified two protein species which competed for and uncoupled the binding of EBNA-1 to oriP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two cellular competitors we called anti-EBNA-1 proteins had molecular masses of 60 and 40 kilodaltons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were not found in nuclear extracts of BJAB cells not activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
