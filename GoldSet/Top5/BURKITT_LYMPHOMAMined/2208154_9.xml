<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that regulation of the expression of this gene involves elements within the gene as well as those upstream from the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that a ubiquitous mammalian sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, MDBP, binds specifically to a site in the beginning of the first intron of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This protein, which binds to certain <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> enhancers, may be helping to control expression of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, which contain activated c-myc genes, the MDBP site is lost by chromosome rearrangement or by multiple spontaneous mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This might contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related activation of this protooncogene </plain></SENT>
