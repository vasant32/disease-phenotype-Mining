<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Besides the problems inherent in endoscopically obtained tissue and the low incidence of intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the major difficulties reside in the distinction to reactive processes and in the differential diagnosis among several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the microanatomical and biological properties of the intestinal MALT, supplemented by sufficient clinical information, are important prerequisites for the diagnostic work-up which has to include immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas the diagnosis of aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) is usually straightforward, lymphomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> (LP, the intestinal equivalent of mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and low-grade B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of MALT-type may be difficult to diagnose and to separate from reactive lymphoproliferations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristic immunohistochemical profile of LP (cyclin D1 + CD5 + CD43 + CD23 - CD10 - IgM kappa or lambda, is very helpful in this regard and similarly useful to exclude intestinal involvement by B-CLL or follicular center <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the endoscopic appearance characterized by seeds of small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> along the colorectum favors LP although MALT-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> may occasionally produce polypoid lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp> occurs in the terminal ileum and may present with a mass in the right iliac fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of intestinal T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ITL) represents the most challenging task for both clinicians and pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This disease is often associated with and may closely mimick <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> type, or can be misdiagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of an abnormal activated T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, i.e. different from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intraepithelial lymphocytes, strongly suggests ITL and is of particular importance in cases that lack overt cytological atypia </plain></SENT>
