<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is shown that irradiation in the dose range between 2 and 20 cGy (maximum at 10 cGy) stimulates growth of cultured cells due to the shortening of the lag phase of cell growth, with the duration of the doubling time being unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preirradiation of growth medium in this dose range also stimulates cell proliferation, though to a lesser extent than irradiation of cells and the medium does </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effect manifests itself in an increase in the cell number as well as in the size and number of colonies </plain></SENT>
