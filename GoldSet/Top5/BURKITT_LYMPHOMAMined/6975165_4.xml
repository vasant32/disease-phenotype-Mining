<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a range of levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor numbers seen in the various subclasses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This variability cannot be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors, since the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with the highest growth fraction (i.e., Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with lower growth fractions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> have some measurable level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors; therefore, the resistance seen in vivo cannot be explained by the lack of receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there has been a positive correlation, in our hands, with receptor level and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of in vitro models, it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines (i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">common ALL</z:e> of childhood) have relative stability of their genetic material making <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low-receptor cell lines (i.e., T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This greater genetic variability in the low-receptor lines could account for the earlier emergence of clinical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> resistance in these patients </plain></SENT>
