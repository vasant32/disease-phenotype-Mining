<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This G-rich region of the c-MYC promoter has been shown to form a G-quadruplex structure that acts as a silencer element for c-MYC transcriptional control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we have synthesized a series of 11-substituted quindoline analogues as c-MYC G-quadruplex-stabilizing compounds, and the cell-free and in vitro activity of these compounds were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> (4 and 12) demonstrated good cell-free profiles, and compound 4 (2-(4-(10H-indolo[3,2-b]quinolin-11-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine) significantly down-regulated c-MYC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, despite the good cell-free activity and the effect of these compounds on c-MYC gene expression, we have demonstrated, using a cellular assay in a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (CA46-specific), that these effects were not mediated through targeting of the c-MYC G-quadruplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, caution should be used in assigning the effects of G-quadruplex-interactive compounds that lower c-MYC to direct targeting of these promoter elements unless this assay, or similar ones, demonstrates direct targeting of the G-quadruplex in cells </plain></SENT>
