<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-Myc protein is a transcription factor with an N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain and C-terminal oligomerization and DNA-binding motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that p107, a protein related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein, binds to the c-Myc transcriptional activation domain and suppresses its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize the transforming activity and transcriptional properties of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived mutant MYC alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alleles encoding c-Myc proteins with missense mutations in the transcriptional regulatory domain were more potent than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> c-Myc in transforming rodent fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mutant c-Myc proteins retained their binding to p107 in in vitro and in vivo assays, p107 failed to suppress their transcriptional activation activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived MYC alleles contain missense mutations that result in substitution for the threonine at codon 58 or affect sequences flanking this amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that in vivo phosphorylation of Thr-58 was absent in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line with a mutant MYC allele containing a missense mutation flanking codon 58 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro studies suggest that phosphorylation of Thr-58 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> c-Myc was dependent on cyclin A and required prior phosphorylation of Ser-62 by a p107-cyclin A-CDK complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Thr-58 remained unphosphorylated in two representative mutant c-Myc transactivation domains in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that missense mutations in MYC may be selected for during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e>, because the mutant MYC proteins have altered functional interactions with p107 protein complexes and fail to be phosphorylated at Thr-58 </plain></SENT>
