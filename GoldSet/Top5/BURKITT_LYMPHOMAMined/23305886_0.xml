<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional regulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncoprotein LMP1, remains yet not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMP1 expression can be initiated in an EBNA2 dependent or independent manner from ED-L1 or LT-R1 promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that sequence variation at ED-L1 region could be an important factor concerning LMP1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize the natural sequence variation of the ED-L1 promoter, and its relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 44 pediatric patients, 17 IM and 27 EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases from Argentina, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis showed 4 main clusters, namely B95.8, Raji, Cao and P3HR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most isolates, 80.3%, conformed the B95.8 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with more than one <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> variant was detected in 5/17 IM cases, but no co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were detected among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, co-infected IM cases exhibited differences between the ED-L1 sequences obtained from different anatomical compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations confined to transcription factor binding sites such as SP1/SP3, CRE, AP2, C/EBP were found in similar proportions in 23 isolates from both benign and malignant samples, rendering the distribution of these mutations not significant among malignant samples </plain></SENT>
