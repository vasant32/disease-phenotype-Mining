<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the factors that predispose towards invasive fungal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinosinusitis</z:e> (FS) in immunocompromised children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and 2) to propose practice guidelines for management of pediatric FS in immunocompromised patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 9 patients who developed invasive FS compared to 8 patients who did not develop invasive FS during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting signs and symptoms, nasal endoscopic findings, radiographs, laboratory studies, histologic and microscopic samples, and outcomes were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen consecutive pediatric immunocompromised patients with hematologic and lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> underwent nasal endoscopy and biopsy for possible FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were diagnosed with 10 episodes of FS; 1 patient developed FS with different organisms on 2 separate occasions separated by 6 months; 8 patients were not diagnosed with FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); 6 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL); 1 patient had Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 1 patient had undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>; and 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005531'>biphenotypic acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with FS had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 600 or less (range 0-600) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with FS had either persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> or sinus symptoms (facial pain, nasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, rhinorrhea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus CT scans were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with FS and without FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with FS had maxillary sinus retention <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative endoscopic findings were helpful diagnostically when <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or ulceration was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the non-FS group normalized their ANCs; 2 of the 9 patients in the FS group did not normalize their ANC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 2 patients died from disseminated FS or from complications due to their immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with FS had either persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> or symptoms localized to the sinuses (facial pain, nasal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, or rhinorrhea) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic examination was helpful when <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We recommend directed biopsies of suspicious lesions, the middle and inferior turbinate, in immunocompromised, neutropenic pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> who present with either persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> or localizing symptoms to the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We favor the use of "rush" biopsies over frozen sections because of the better-quality sections and ability to perform appropriate stains </plain></SENT>
