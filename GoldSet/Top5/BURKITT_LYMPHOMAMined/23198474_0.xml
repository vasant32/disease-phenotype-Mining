<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the spectrum of OMF histopathological diagnoses encountered in a sample of South African children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was designed to analyse the clinico-pathologic data, as obtained from OMF histopathology reports, at the University of the Witwatersrand's Division of Oral Pathology over a 20-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 1,258 OMF biopsies from children &lt; or = 16 years of age with histologically confirmed disease were recorded, accounting for 6,5% of the total number of OMF biopsies received during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathology involving the jaw bones formed the largest category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> OMF pathologies and was predominated by odontogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining pathology, in decreasing order of frequency; involved the oral/perioral soft tissues, salivary glands and oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> comprised 4,1% of the total number of cases with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> emerging as the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the smallest number of biopsy specimens was obtained from children younger than 5-years of age, the likelihood of a malignant diagnosis in this age group was substantially higher than in older children </plain></SENT>
