<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five common <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, LCLs, pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated blasts and resting B-cells from healthy donors, and eight pairs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and LCLs, each pair originating from one patient, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis was performed using a radioimmunoassay; qualitative aspects were studied by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, LCLs expressed significantly higher amounts of class I antigens than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells, the latter showing class I densities similar to or lower than peripheral resting B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From analysis of the expression of class I-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, there is some evidence that class I antigen expression is regulated on the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells studied, class I expression could be enhanced by gamma-interferon, whereas the corresponding LCLs seemed to be refractory to this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines, in addition to the generally lower class I expression, distinct class I specificities were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these alterations in class I expression was EBV specific; however, they may well play a role in the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells and LCLs by cellular immune mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, down-regulation of class I antigens may contribute to the resistance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, whereas their enhanced expression may improve the recognition of EBV-infected LCLs </plain></SENT>
