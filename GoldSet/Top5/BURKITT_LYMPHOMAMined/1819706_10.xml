<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paf, from 1 x 10(-5) M to 10(-6) M, <z:mp ids='MP_0005093'>decreased B cell proliferation</z:mp> induced by both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and anti-IgM antibodies (anti-IgM Ab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 1 x 10(-7) M to 1 x 10(-9) M paf enhanced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> triggered, but not anti-IgM triggered B cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B cell proliferation was modulated between 24 and 72 hr of culture indicating that the effect of paf did not merely reflect a shift in proliferation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, paf also enhanced the spontaneous proliferation of a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived B cell line, Raji, which suggests that paf can directly act on B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modulatory effect of paf on peripheral blood B cells was independent of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> concentration, yet the effect on Raji cells was dependent upon cell density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that paf is a potent modulator of B cell function, and may be involved in the control of humoral immune response </plain></SENT>
