<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis showed that this monovalent immunotoxin had a binding affinity of 3 nmol/L, within 15-fold of the bivalent parental monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G28-5 sFv-PE40 was stable when incubated in mouse serum at 37 degrees C for 6 hours and cleared from the circulation of mice with a half-life of 16.7 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This immunotoxin was effective in treating human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografted <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice with complete responses, defined by an asymptomatic phenotype for greater than 120 days, obtained at doses of 0.13 to 0.26 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of treatment was dependent on the schedule used, with every three days for five injections being the most effective tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of G28-5 sFv-PE40 was examined in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice, rats, and monkeys, with the maximum tolerated dose being 0.48, 1.0, and 1.67 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative immunohistology showed that the G28-5 specificity was qualitatively similar between human and monkey tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, G28-5 sFv-PE40 was effective at inducing complete antitumor responses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> xenografted mice at doses that were well tolerated in mice, rats, and monkeys </plain></SENT>
