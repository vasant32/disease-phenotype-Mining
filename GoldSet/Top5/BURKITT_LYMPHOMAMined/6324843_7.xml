<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a series of 49 abdominal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from the Paediatric Clinic of Surgery, Mustapha Hospital, Algiers, has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age distribution shows a peak between 4 and 5 years of age, and the sex ratio is (M:F) 2.26:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by a rapid evolution in the absence of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major problem is an explosive form of the disease, which at present seems difficult to control in this country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 49 patients (30.6%) died before completion of the first course of chemotherapy; however, complete remission (CR) was obtained for 30 patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 42.85% (21/49), whereas survival of patients who reached CR is 70% (21/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When CR was obtained, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were related to cerebrospinal fluid involvement, local recurrence, secondary bone marrow involvement or therapeutic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients alive with no evidence of disease (NED) 8-months after CR can be considered definitively cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology performed on 31 BL patients and on a control group of 25 children with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> showed that most Algerian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> have elevated EBV titres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A search for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> markers within malignant cells in 17 patients indicated that 88% (15/17) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases were EBV-associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the immunological and cytogenetic data showed that, as in the rest of the world, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases involve proliferation of B-cell-type lymphocytes, with characteristic cytogenetic translocations involving chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This report represents the most detailed description so far of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from an area in non-equatorial Africa and the first report of a large series from North Africa </plain></SENT>
