<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Hodgkin-associated Ki-1 antigen (CD30) consists of a 120-kDa membrane-associated glycosylated phosphoprotein (Ki-1/120) and a 57-kDa non-glycosylated phosphoprotein (Ki-1/57) which only occurs intracellularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both molecules are phosphorylated at serine residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragments resulting from staphylococcal V8-protease digestion of the Ki-1/57 molecule revealed identical bands irrespective of the cell source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a few bands of the Ki-1/57 digests appeared among the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> fragments of the Ki-1/120 membrane antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein kinase activity was tested for both forms of the Ki-1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ki-1/120, devoid of the Ki-1/57 molecule, was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of Hodgkin-analogous cell lines L428 or L540, which had been loaded with the Ki-1 or the Ki-1-analogous antibodies Ber-H2, HSR-1, -2 and -3 (method 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These other antibodies reacted with the Ki-1/120, but not with the Ki-1/57 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter, devoid of the Ki-1/120, was isolated from L540 cells after removal of the membrane form by method 1 or from U266/Bl <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> or Raji Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells which only contain the smaller form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effects of non-specific adsorption were eliminated by various control precipitates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Ki-1/57 intracellular antigen showed autophosphorylation and could phosphorylate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a protein kinase activity of the membrane-associated Ki-1/120 could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
