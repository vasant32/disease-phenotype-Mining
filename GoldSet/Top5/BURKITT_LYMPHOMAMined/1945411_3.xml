<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the possibility that expression of P0 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> may be capable of independent regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate this possibility we have isolated putative regulatory domains flanking P0 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> starts within the human c-myc gene and analysed both their ability to direct expression of control reporter genes and their ability to interact with specific transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regulatory regions necessary for expression of P0 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> have been located within 131 bp 5' of the first major P0 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNAase 1 footprint analysis and gel retardation assays demonstrate binding of transcription factors Sp1, NF1 and CBP to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NF1 binds specifically to two consensus sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The more distal site overlaps with the binding site for CBP, and it is likely that concomitant binding of NF1 and CBP within the distal region of the P0 promoter is not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous work from our laboratory has described a negative regulatory domain within the 5' flanking region of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P0 promoter resides within this domain and therefore may contain a negative regulator of c-myc gene expression </plain></SENT>
