<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr-1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of B cell lines, including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Egr-1 expression correlates with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> and the specific pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency established within the individual cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, constitutive activation of Egr-1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group III EBV genome carrying cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Egr-1 expression is abrogated in group I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006413" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BL">Burkitt tumor</z:e> cells, irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr-1 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several forms of EGR-1 protein are found within the different groups of cell lines, and the binding activity to DNA consensus sequences was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, time course analysis of Egr-1 expression during the early steps of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> in vitro demonstrated that Egr-1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte </plain></SENT>
