<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell growth was inhibited and this effect was reversible, non-toxic, and proportional to the concentration of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate up to 20mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The total <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilisation and the total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> production were reduced in proportion to the inhibition of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>D-beta-hydroxybutyrate was not metabolised by the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other glycolytic inhibitors and chemical analogues of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate either did not inhibit or proved to be too toxic for cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D-beta-hydroxybutyrate also inhibited the growth of rabbit kidney (RK13), HeLa, mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> (B16), fibroblast and trypsin-dispersed human thyroid and beef testis cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in vivo dietary-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001946'>ketosis</z:hpo> reduced the number of B16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> deposits in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice by two-thirds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of these results in the clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
