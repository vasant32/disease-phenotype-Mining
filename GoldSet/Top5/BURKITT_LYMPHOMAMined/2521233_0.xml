<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human blood lymphocytes stimulated in mixed cultures by allogeneic B cell lines were shown to cleave C3 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The B cell lines were derived from Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients: 1) established from their EBV-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, 2) the EBV-positive sublines converted in vitro, and 3) lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) i.e., B lymphocytes transformed in vitro by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cell lines differed considerably in their capacity to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The split products of C3 were detected in the supernatants and on the surface of the activated lymphocytes at levels which correlated with the strength of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes cultured with LCL had the highest levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation blast transformation, C3 cleavage, and C3 fragment fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes exposed to the EBV-negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> were stimulated weakly and their C3-activating capacity was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of the efficiency of lymphocyte stimulation induced in the cultures, 60 to 70% of the blasts were found to fix C3 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the lymphocytes which fixed C3 fragments were T blasts that carried the CD3 marker and expressed IL-2R (CD25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD4 and CD8 cells were represented with equal frequency in the C3-fragment fixing and C3-fragment negative populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-exposure of the MLC-activated lymphocytes to human serum increased their cytotoxic capacity toward CR type 2-carrying targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The enhanced lysis was abrogated by F(ab)2 rabbit anti-human C3d or rabbit anti-CR type 2 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the C3 fragments fixed on the lymphocytes bind to CR on the targets and elevate the avidity of binding between the two interacting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was also indicated by an increase in the frequency of lymphocyte-target conjugates </plain></SENT>
