<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The formation of the signaling complexes requires LMP1 oligomerization, a role assigned to the membrane-spanning domains of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is, however, increasing evidence that these membrane-spanning domains are not only confined to oligomerization but play a direct role in downregulation of promoter activity and cytostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a new inhibitory activity which is effective on <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or cellular promoters (even the endogenous ones), requires only membrane-spanning domains 3-4 or 5-6 and is neither associated with cytostasis nor with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
