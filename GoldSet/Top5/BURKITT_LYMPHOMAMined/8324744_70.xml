<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was tested that expression of bcl-2 could provide protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by cytotoxic drugs via a mechanism which was different from the classical determinants of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and resistance to inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>45) were chosen for study since these drugs have a well-defined and quantifiable locus of action with similarly well defined biochemical sequelae resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells transfected with the vector alone readily underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after a 36-h exposure to various drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (0.1 microM) induced 67% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in vector control cells 24 h after removal of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells treated under identical conditions, but which expressed the bcl-2 protein, showed only basal levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (8%), with no significant fall in viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained using two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36621">quinazoline</z:chebi>-based inhibitors of thymidylate synthase, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717) and ICI M247496 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Determinants of resistance to these three drugs were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the cell cycle, thymidylate synthase levels, and activity showed these to be unchanged by expression of bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of the drugs brought about equivalent inhibition of proliferation in the presence or absence of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5-Fluorodeoxyuridine treatment reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> synthesis, induced strand breaks in nascent DNA, measured by alkaline elution, and increased the synthesis of thymidylate synthase; these changes preceded the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and were identical in the vector controls and bcl-2 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resistance to thymidylate stress in bcl-2-expressing cells therefore occurred by a mechanism different from those which classically define resistance to this type of cytotoxic drug </plain></SENT>
