<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To select the isotype of a CD19 MoAb most suitable for radioimmunotherapy of patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, we studied the influence of MoAb isotype on modulation, after binding of the MoAb to different cell-line cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD19-IgG1 MoAb was found to induce modulation of CD19 antigens on Daudi cell line cells more rapidly than did its IgG2a switch variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that this difference in modulation rate is caused by the expression of Fc gamma receptor II (Fc gamma RII) on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanism of Fc gamma RII involvement in modulation induction by CD19-IgG1 showed that Fc gamma RII did not comodulate with CD19 MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, cocrosslinking of CD19 and Fc gamma RII with CD19-IgG1 MoAb resulted in enhanced calcium mobilization in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increased signal induction accompanies the enhanced capping and subsequent modulation of CD19 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because Fc gamma RII is expressed in varying densities on malignant B cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differentiation stages, our results have implications for the MoAb isotype most suitable for use in MoAb-based therapy of patients with B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
