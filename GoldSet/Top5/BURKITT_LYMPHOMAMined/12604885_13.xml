<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the lymphoid proliferations arising in solid organ transplant recipients, collectively referred to as posttransplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (PT-LPDs), represent a clinically and histopathologically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven B-cell proliferations of variable clonal composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a retrospective histopathologic review of lymphoid proliferations associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> we identified 10 cases that morphologically resemble the polymorphic PT-LPDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They arose in lymph nodes (five), lungs (two), and the parotid gland, perineum, and skin (one each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They exhibit a diffuse growth pattern and are composed of a polymorphic lymphoid cell population exhibiting a variable degree of plasmacytic differentiation, cytologic atypia, and numbers of atypical immunoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A clonal B-cell population was detected by immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangement and/or EBV terminal repeat analysis in 8 of the 10 (80%) cases by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nongermline hybridizing bands were usually faint, however, suggesting that the clonal B-cell population represented only a subpopulation within the polymorphic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong clonal rearrangement bands were present in one case in which there was clear morphologic evidence of transformation to diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case exhibited C-MYC, BCL-6, and p53 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One other case exhibited a p53 gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining eight cases lacked C-MYC, BCL-6, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, and p53 gene alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> was detected in 4 of the 10 (40%) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Like EBV-containing PT-LPDs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four EBV-positive HIV-associated polymorphic lesions were associated with type A EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated herpesvirus was detectable in two cases by polymerase chain reaction analysis, but not by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo>-associated herpesvirus in some of the cytologically malignant-appearing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, polymorphic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> comparable morphologically and molecularly to those arising after solid organ transplantation also occur in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As in the case of their polymorphic PT-LPD counterparts, their malignant status, biologic significance, and relationship to monomorphic B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
