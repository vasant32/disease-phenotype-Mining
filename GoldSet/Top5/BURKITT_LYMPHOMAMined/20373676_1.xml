<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This real country-based, cross-sectional, retrospective study reviews <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> out-patient clinical records of patients histologically and/or clinically diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from January, 2000 to December, 2007 at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana, a country within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> belts of the world </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mean age of 6.9 +/- 2.7 (range: 1-16) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males generally dominated in incidence (M:F=1.43:1, P&lt;0.001) and significantly with facial presentation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age range 4-8 years was the high risk range (P&lt;0.001) for both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Males were affected early in life (4-7 years) compared to their female counterparts (6-11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 551 cases reviewed, 48.3%, 32.7%, 15.8% and 3.3% involved the face, abdomen, combined facial and abdominal and either facial or abdominal with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement (usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An intriguing observation was evident between facial and combined facial and abdominal cases which exhibited reversed trends in incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three regions within the forest zone showed significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) incidences compared to the seven cohorts from the coastal and savannah agro-ecological zones of Ghana </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No region was explicitly associated with any particular clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study has shown that although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> can present with demographic patterns in prevalence within a given geographical location, no clinical characterisation is associated with such patterns </plain></SENT>
