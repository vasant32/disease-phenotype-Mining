<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The large non-cleaved follicular center cell (FCC) type showed higher contents of cleaved cells than did the others; the geometric mean value differed significantly from that of small non-cleaved FCC Burkitt type (p less than 0.0001) or non-Burkitt type (p less than 0.01) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency toward a better prognosis with large fractions of cleaved cells but no statistical difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic characteristics of the neoplastic clone are better revealed by the predominant cell </plain></SENT>
