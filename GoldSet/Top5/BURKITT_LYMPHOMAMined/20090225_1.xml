<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is paucity of data pertaining to EBV association with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in India  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: The study aims to investigate the association of EBV in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients attending pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> services of the referral center have been included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five consecutive pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic lukemia (ALL) were subjected to EBV studies employing sensitive polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization for presence of Bam H1-W region of EBV genome and detection of anti Z EBV replication activator (ZEBRA) antibodies using Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive control included a case of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Raji cells were used as positive control with each test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PCR for EBV was positive in 8/25 patients of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot test using anti ZEBRA antibodies was positive in 5/25(20%) cases of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering PCR as the gold standard, 32% of the children with ALL had evidence of active EBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The positive controls were consistently positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 30 healthy laboratory controls, 22 age matched disease controls, 12 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and 15 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> were positive either by PCR or Western blots assays (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant correlation between duration of therapy and EBV positivity (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that a significant number of patients with ALL show evidence of active EBV replication </plain></SENT>
