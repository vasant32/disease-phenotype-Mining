<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome has recently been detected in various non-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including various T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and in Reed-Sternberg cells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, but the contribution of EBV genes to the transformed phenotype remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the possible effect which the EBV genes LMP1 and EBNA2, of which the expression has been reported in non-B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, may have on a variety of cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LMP1 and EBNA2 genes were transiently expressed from heterologous promoters in two human T-cell lines (HPB-ALL and Jurkat), two human cell lines of the myeloid lineage (K562 and U937), one type I Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line (Rael) and in human primary T cells and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cell surface expression of CD23, CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 was monitored on transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cell lines, except U937, the surface antigens CD21 and ICAM-1 were upregulated in a dose-dependent and transient manner by the transient expression of LMP1, and EBNA2 slightly enhanced the effects of LMP1 on CD23 and CD21 upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP1 also induced increased CD21, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 surface expression on transfected primary T-cells, and CD21 and ICAM-1 in four of five B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, LMP1 transient expression caused <z:mp ids='MP_0000354'>increased cell size</z:mp> of the primary T cells and responding B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that LMP1 can trigger specific responses in a variety of white cell types and thus is probably contributing to the phenotype of EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells not only in the B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
