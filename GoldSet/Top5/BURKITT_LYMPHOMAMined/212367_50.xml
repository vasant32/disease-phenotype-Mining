<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> American KS sera contained CMV antibodies and their geometric mean titers (GMT) were significantly higher than those in sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> patients (GMT ratio k = 5.3 to 7.7 by complement fixation [CF], k = 8.9 by indirect hemagglutination [IHA]) or in sera of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (k = 12.6 to 16.0 by CF, k = 12.6 by IHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The result is strongly reminiscent of the data obtained previously for European KS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the GMT to CMV of African KS patients were similar to the GMT of the American KS groups, their significance cannot be demonstrated due to the high background of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infections</z:e> in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex mechanisms are hypothesized, by analogy with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) involvement in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), for a CMV involvement in the development of KS </plain></SENT>
