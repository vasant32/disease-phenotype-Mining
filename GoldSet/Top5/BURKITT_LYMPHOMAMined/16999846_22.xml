<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the dic(9;20)(p11-13;q11) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in paediatric B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (BCP ALL), occurring in approximately 2% of the cases, its molecular genetic consequences have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) were used to characterise the 9p and 20q breakpoints (BPs) in seven childhood BCP ALLs with dic(9;20), which was shown to be unbalanced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them, resulting in loss of 9p13.2-pter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the cases had loss of 20q11.2-qter, whereas two displayed gain of 20cen-pter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BPs on 9p clustered in a 1.5 Mb segment of the sub-band 9p13.2; in three of the cases, the 20q BPs mapped to three adjacent clones covering a distance of 350 kb at 20q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aberration should be designated dic(9;20)(p13.2;q11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the ALLs, shown to have a complex dic(9;20), was further investigated by FISH, revealing a rearrangement of the haemapoietic cell kinase isoform p61 (HCK) gene at 20q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disruption of HCK may result in a fusion gene or in loss of function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, lack of material precluded further analyses of HCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it remains to be elucidated whether dic(9;20)(p13.2;q11.2) leads to a chimaeric gene or whether the functionally important outcome is loss of 9p and 20q material </plain></SENT>
