<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the epidemiology and aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> by analysing data from cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, up to June 30, 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this period 97,258 AIDS cases were reported, of whom 2824 (2.9%) had non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition was about 60 times more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients than in the general US population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased from 0% in those under 1 year old to 3.5% in those aged 50 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the brain was constant at 0.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> increased from zero in infants to a peak at 10-19 years of age (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was twice as common in whites as in blacks and in men as in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> was most common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophilia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> and least common in those born in the Caribbean or Africa who had acquired HIV by heterosexual contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data suggested that whilst infectious agents (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) may be associated with development of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> patients there was probably no single cause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the most puzzling question is why Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> but not with other types of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
