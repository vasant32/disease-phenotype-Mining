<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the role of Spi-1 in the transcriptional regulation of B cell and myeloid specific genes has been largely demonstrated, the biological function of Spi-B still remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since Spi-B and Spi-1 are very divergent in their transactivator domain, these domains might acquire functional specificity in vivo by interacting with different co-factors and/or by undergoing different phosphorylations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we observed that casein kinase II phosphorylates Spi-B as well as Spi-1, in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, by affinity chromatographies and in vitro kinase assays with fusion proteins between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase and the transactivator domain of Spi-B, two kinases were identified on their ability to interact and phosphorylate this domain; the MAP kinase ERK1 and the stress activated protein kinase JNK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Threonine 56 was defined as the ERK1 phosphorylation site by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26051">phosphoamino-acid</z:chebi> analyses and a Spi-B mutant version with the substitution T56 to A56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, ERK1 failed to phosphorylate Spi-1, in vitro, whereas JNK1, like CK II, phosphorylated Spi-B and Spi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, other purified Spi-B-kinase activities, unidentified as yet, display similar specificity than ERK1 for Spi-B versus Spi-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the evident interaction of pRb protein with the transactivator domain of Spi-B in an unphosphorylated state disappeared when this domain was first phosphorylated in vitro either by ERK1 or by the purified Spi-B-kinase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data revealed multiple phosphorylation sites within Spi-B whose some of them appeared specific for Spi-B versus Spi-1 and which may account for differential regulation of their activities </plain></SENT>
