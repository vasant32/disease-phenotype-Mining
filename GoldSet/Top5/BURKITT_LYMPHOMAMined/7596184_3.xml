<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These molecular pathways include the formation of the fusion transcripts BCR/ABL and E2A/PBX1, due to t(9;22) and t(1;19), respectively, as well as rearrangements of the MLL gene at 11q23 and of c-MYC at 8q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hyperdiploid ALL in the absence of chromosomal structural abnormalities is an additional ALL molecular subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> family genes and of the p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene represent additional genetic lesions detected in a fraction (10-20%) of ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> activation in ALL may be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> molecular subtypes of ALL and denotes poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, little is known regarding the clinical and biological features of ALL cases carrying p53 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to help clarify the role of p53 inactivation in ALL development, we have determined the frequency of p53 mutations throughout the molecular spectrum of B cell lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report that p53 inactivation in ALL of B cell lineage is restricted to cases carrying a rearrangement of MLL or c-MYC, whereas it is consistently negative in other molecular subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data underline the molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ALL of B cell lineage and indicate that at least some of the molecular pathways involved in ALL pathogenesis require more than one genetic lesion </plain></SENT>
