<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The signals involved in regulating the proliferation, differentiation and survival of B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (B-CLL) cells are fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-CLL cells have been found to respond poorly to various activation signals and only after successful Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation has it been possible to maintain such cells in long-term cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work we describe a new method to activate and induce proliferation in B-CLL cells and to maintain such cells in long-term culture for longer than 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used a combination of protocols in an attempt to mimic some of the signals of a thymus-dependent immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The B-CLL cells were first activated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC) particles plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi> (Trx), followed by stimulation with interleukin (IL)-2 + Trx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This treatment primed the cells for further stimulation with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) presented on irradiated CD32L cells (the CD40-system) or soluble CD40 Ligand, and a combination of Trx and cytokines (IL-4 + IL-10), which allowed the cells to be maintained for up to 1 month with preserved viability and a variable rate of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, induced proliferation of the B-CLL cells was limited to approximately 1 month, suggesting that additional signals are required to facilitate further proliferation </plain></SENT>
