<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations at the short arm of chromosome 9 have been reported in a remarkable percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> (ALL) and have been suggested to cause the loss of activity of the putative TSG, p16INK4A (MTS1/CDKN2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the correlation between this gene inactivation and visible cytogenetic abnormalities, we have investigated p16INK4A homozygous gene deletions in 10 paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> of different cell lineages which demonstrated karyotype aberrations involving chromosome 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the dimension of the genetic alteration was evaluated by studying the loss of heterozygosity of two highly polymorphic markers of chromosome 9p, namely alpha-interferon (IFNA) and D9S104, and the deletion of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAPase) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the deletion of a gene belonging to p16INK4A family, the p18 gene, was analysed in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that: (1) the biallelic loss of p16INK4A gene is strictly related to a specific immunophenotype, namely ALL of T-cell lineage; (ii) no significant correlation exists between alterations at chromosome 9p level and the homozygous deletions of p16INK4A gene; and (iii) p18 gene was not deleted in the examined cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a possible correlation between the T-lymphocyte phenotype and the expression of p16INK4A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the absence of MTAPase activity seems to be a valuable marker of p16INK4A gene inactivation, thus indicating that the deleted chromosomal area on 9p21 very frequently involves the MTAPase gene </plain></SENT>
