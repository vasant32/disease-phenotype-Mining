<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A molecular clone of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> myc (v-myc), the oncogene of avian myelocytomatosis virus, MC29, detected homologous human, mouse, and Chinese hamster cellular myc (c-myc) sequences by Southern filter hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A v-myc probe, containing sequences from the 3' domain of the gene, hybridized to single human HindIII and mouse EcoRI genomic DNA fragments of the cellular myc genes whose segregation could be followed in interspecies somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human c-myc segregated concordantly with the enzyme marker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase and with a karyotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rearrangement of human c-myc was observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells possessing the t(8;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that human c-myc is located close to the breakpoint on chromosome 8 (q24) involved in the t(8;14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mouse c-myc gene segregated concordantly with chromosome 15 in mouse-Chinese hamster cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These gene assignments are noteworthy, as structural and numerical abnormalities of human chromosome 8 and mouse chromosome 15 are associated frequently with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
