<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypes were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and karyotypes were analyzed in 37 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection with JSB1 or with C219 led to similar results in terms of positive cells and cases, but the intensity of staining was higher with JSB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the populations studied, the rate of first complete remission differed between <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-negative in adult patients only (56% v 93%, respectively, P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 MDR-positive patients who had presented a first complete remission, 13 (81%) relapsed, compared with 13 of 35 (37%) <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-negative (P = .008) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of relapse among <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive compared with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-negative patients was observed in adults and in children taken separately (adults 100% v 46%; children 73% v 32%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rates (Kaplan-Meier method) were significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-negative compared with <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive populations as a whole (P = .002) and among children (P = .05) and adults (P = .03) taken separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Event-free survival curves followed this trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of second complete remission was very low in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-positive group (15%) compared with 38% for the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results were shown by multivariate analysis to be independent of age, immunophenotypes, and karyotypes and clearly show the importance of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype detection in ALL </plain></SENT>
