<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 12 with clinical data had acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome before the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 15 with data available, a body cavity was the site of initial presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytological subtypes were large cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e>, n = 7; large cell anaplastic, n = 6; and large cell NOS, n = 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of anaplastic large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and the conspicuous absence of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> differ strikingly from HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> generally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypically, two cases were B-cell (CD19/20+, sIg+, CD/5-), one was T-cell (CD3+, CD5+, CD4+, CD8-, CD19/20-, sIg-), and 15 were null (CD45+, HLA-DR+ CD19/20-, sIg-, CD3/5-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This 83% incidence of null immunophenotype contrasts sharply with a 9% incidence among 35 tissue-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in HIV+ patients that were similarly studied and a 0% null immunophenotype among 11 lymphomatous effusions in patients without HIV risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 18 HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> expressed CD30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of five cases with null immunophenotype showed Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangement, two had clonal Epstein-Barr virus integration, and none had MYC protooncogene rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases belong to a subgroup of high-grade HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that occur in the setting of profound immunosuppression in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> predominates and MYC rearrangement is encountered only infrequently </plain></SENT>
