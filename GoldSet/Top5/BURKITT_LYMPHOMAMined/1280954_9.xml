<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same promoter fragment was not active in Jurkat T cells nor did it respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> in either cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least three distinct elements, the CK-1 sequence, a decanucleotide present in haemopoietic growth factor genes, an NF-IL-6 consensus sequence and a consensus octamer sequence, were essential in the G-CSF promoter for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of any of these sequences abolished promoter function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mutation of two other consensus protein binding sequences, i.e. a Pu-1 site and a CK-2-like sequence, did not eliminate promoter function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the CK-1 and octamer sequences acted independently as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta responsive elements upstream of a heterologous promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response of the octamer sequence and the 330 bp promoter but not the CK-1 sequence was greater with IL-1 beta than TNF-alpha reflecting a similar response of the endogenous gene </plain></SENT>
