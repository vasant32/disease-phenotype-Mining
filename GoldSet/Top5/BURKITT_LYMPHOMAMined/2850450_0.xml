<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using anti-human B cell monoclonal antibodies prepared against B1 (CD20), B2 (CD21), B4 (CD19), and BB-1 (B lymphoblast antigen-1), we compared the expression of B cell differentiation antigens on a Jijoye-P3HR-1 cell line family of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of BB-1 and B2 antigens was faint on P3HR-1 K cell line which is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) high producer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, B1 and B4 antigens were strongly expressed on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was also found that BB-1 expression decreased on P3HR-1 cells after activation of intracellular EBV genes by treating chemically with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting agent (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, or on Raji cells on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> with EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This decrease of BB-1 was blocked by the additional treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of virus replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dual immunofluorescence staining analysis showed that the individual cell expressing EBV-associated antigens expressed BB-1 antigen only marginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the change in phenotypes of host B cells and the activation of the EBV genome is discussed </plain></SENT>
