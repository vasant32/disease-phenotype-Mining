<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative densitometric analysis of ribosomal ribosomal DNA fragment distribution in families demonstrates additive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> in those with chromosomally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or aneuploid offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences between offspring and parental ribosomal DNA patterns could be explained by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> distribution of length variants on the acrocentric chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New ribosomal DNA length variants of 9.0, 6.7, 5.5, and 5.2 kilobases were observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals after BamHI restriction, and the former two were present in multiple copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> specimens exhibited ribosomal DNA patterns that were generally characteristic of the patient rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, novel ribosomal DNA length variants or changes in length variant proportions were noted in three of the four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> for which adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue was available for comparison; these alterations occurred in a Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consistent karyotype of 50,XY in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>Wilms tumor</z:hpo> specimen supports previous evidence for increased repetitive DNA variation in aneuploid, neoplastic tissues </plain></SENT>
