<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the major clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated NHL is the high frequency of extra-nodal involvement, including the gastrointestinal tract, at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1997 to December 2004, 8 cases of NHL of the digestive tract and anexal glands (liver and parotid gland) were observed at the HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> division of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infectious Diseases</z:e> FJ Mu√±iz Hospital from Buenos Aires, Argentina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were staged by computed tomography scanning and bone marrow examination, in addition to the endoscopic evaluation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 42 years and the median CD4 T cell count was 87 cells/uL at the time of the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient was receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy with granulocitic growth factor support plus highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); 2 of them (cavum and one of the colon) had a prolonged survival with immune reconstitution during 5 and 6 years, respectively, after the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the patients, which received HAART plus chemotherapy, was 33 months </plain></SENT>
