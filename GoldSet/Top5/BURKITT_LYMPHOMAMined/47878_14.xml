<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2m IgG and Fab' fragments completely inhibited the MLR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of stimulator or responder cells with anti-beta2m suggested that the major effect of anti-beta2m may be on the responder cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clear-cut effect on responder cells was demonstrated by showing that anti-beta2m completely inhibited a MLR in which the stimulator population was a beta2m negative lymphoblastoid cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2m also inhibited <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>-induced proliferation of sensitized lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of this inhibition indicated that anti-beta2m added within the first 18 hr of stimulation was effective in inhibiting the proliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data are discussed in light of the hypothesis that beta2m may be a subunit of an antigen receptor on T cells </plain></SENT>
