<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is necessary to develop new drugs to obtain a better treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one synthetic <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compounds</z:chebi> including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> analogs and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These compounds were serially diluted and added to Akata cells, an EBV-containing cell line derived from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cells were immediately added with anti-human IgG to activate EBV replication within the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After one day of incubation, reduction of EBV protein synthesis was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA replication was assayed by slot blot hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> analogs 2-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-5, 6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribofuranosyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> and 2-ethyl-5, 6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26565">ribofuranosyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36622">benzimidazole</z:chebi> appeared to be the best drugs analyzed </plain></SENT>
