<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma membrane of extragonadal somatic cells absorbed 1.2 to 2.8% of these hydrophobic proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The unoccupied H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of bovine fetal ovarian cells, on the other hand, selectively absorbed polymers of 18,000 mol. wt. subunits, and this antigen-receptor interaction, if allowed to continue for five days, induced the formation of tunica albuginea and seminiferous tubules in bovine XX embryonic indifferent gonads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this manner, human H-Y antigen excreted by Daudi cells has functionally been identified as a series of polymers derived from 18,000 mol. wt. subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While, the H-Y antigenic determinants were retained even by the largest polymeric form that became irreversibly water insoluble, the receptor binding activity was shown only by 36.8% of the available polymeric forms of 18,000 mol. wt. subunits, at the most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, once bound to the receptor site, these polymers were rapidly reduced to the monomeric form on the plasma membrane of bovine fetal ovarian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the 18,000 mol. wt. monomer might actually represent the functional form of H-Y antigen </plain></SENT>
