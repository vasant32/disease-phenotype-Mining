<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals, such as that provided by TGF-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the presence of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> EBV or its transforming latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) results in the loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in human B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemical cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 showed an essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TGF-beta receptor profile in EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals, as evidenced by the TGF-beta 1-mediated modulation of junB gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, TGF-beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV (or LMP-1)-positive cells as opposed to EBV-negative cells, suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, LMP-1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells or EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells do not express D-type cyclins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP-1 can lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
