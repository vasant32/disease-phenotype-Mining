<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of a possible synergy between c-myc and bcl-2 proteins in cell lines, we compared 40 ALL of either T or B lineage with seven Burkitt's ALL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found the same high expression of bcl-2 in adult (Ad) and childhood (Ch) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> examined at presentation, regardless of the T or B phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No bcl-2 expression was detectable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases, except for two investigated at relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 staining intensity was also not related to the stage of blast differentiation, except in Ad <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e>, or to the relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was used to investigate the possible correlation between bcl-2 expression and the proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was found only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirm that bcl-2 expression is the rule in ALL, regardless of the immunophenotypic characteristics at presentation, and that high expression is not correlated with a bad prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> may represent a particular type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, with bcl-2 expression in relapse, but not at presentation </plain></SENT>
