<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>4 showed no significant differences between the various lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> diphosphoribose incorporation, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, cyclic-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, striking differences of activity were found for the enzyme, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25524">NAD(P)</z:chebi> glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activity levels were, as a mean, four times higher in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines than in nonmalignant control lines, and the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Burkitt cell lines containing translocations of chromosome 8 with either chromosomes 2, 14 or 22 showed an increased activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity and significance of this possible enzymatic marker of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells is discussed </plain></SENT>
