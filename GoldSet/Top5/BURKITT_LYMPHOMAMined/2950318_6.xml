<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbit anti-gp 140 was prepared against this highly purified receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using these polyclonal antibodies, it was found that: gp 140 is the C3d receptor (CR2) which reacts with the C3d site expressed on C3d, C3dg, C3bi and at a less extent on C3b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gp 140 is a specific marker of human B lymphocytes; gp 140 is also the Epstein-Barr virus receptor (EBVR); CR2 is a membrane site involved in B-cell regulation; and the C3d/C3dg receptor (CR2) of human B lymphocytes is distinct to the C3dg receptor (CR4) of human neutrophils </plain></SENT>
