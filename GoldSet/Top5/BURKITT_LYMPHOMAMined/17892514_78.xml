<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been found that inappropriate expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of miRNAs (miRs) -143 and -145, the levels of which were previously shown to be reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> and various kinds of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines, was also decreased in most of the B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> examined, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemias</z:hpo> (CLL), B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell lines, and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples from 13 CLL patients and eight of nine B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> ones tested exhibited an extremely low expression of miRs-143 and -145 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of miRs-143 and -145 were consistently low in human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and were inversely associated with the cell proliferation observed in the EBV-transformed B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the introduction of either precursor or mature miR-143 and -145 into Raji cells resulted in a significant growth inhibition that occurred in a dose-dependent manner and the target gene of miRNA-143 was determined to be ERK5, as previously reported in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> DLD-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that miRs-143 and -145 may be useful as biomarkers that differentiate B-cell malignant cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells and contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> in B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> by a newly defined mechanism </plain></SENT>
