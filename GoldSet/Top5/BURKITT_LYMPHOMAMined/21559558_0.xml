<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GLC4, a cell line established at the State University of Groningen from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCLC</z:e>, contains a 30 fold amplified c-myc gene and the cells show a high steady state c-myc transcription rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amplified c-myc copies of this cell line are not grossly rearranged and contain the gene's known major EcoRI (12 kb) fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate in detail the mechanism(s) responsible for transcriptional activation we analyzed the c-myc promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas point mutations, which often occur in a mutational hot spot region in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, were not detected, c-myc transcription in GLC4 initiates mainly from P1 instead of the P2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This promoter shift seems to overcome transcript termination at a transcriptional pause site described for Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> c-myc sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the shift of promoter usage - together with gene amplification - plays a likely role in c-myc transcriptional activation in GLC4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SCLC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
