<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed as HIV positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abdominal CT scan showed a large mass in the ascending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">Gallium</z:chebi> scintigraphy demonstrated increased uptake in the ascending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was performed and histological examination of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> revealed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He received highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and his <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because CD4 count was significantly low at 31/microl, he was treated with dose-adjusted EPOCH (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-EPOCH) combined with HAART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was decreased in size by <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-EPOCH, we changed to the combination of hyper-CVAD/MTX-Ara-C alternating therapy with HAART in order to increase dose intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six cycles of hyper-CVAD/MTX-Ara-C were performed and complete remission was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the HAART era, the survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related diffuse large cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (DLCL) improved dramatically, whereas the survival of similarly treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> remained poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests that intensive chemotherapy with hyper-CVAD/MTX-Ara-C combined with HAART may be well tolerated and effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
