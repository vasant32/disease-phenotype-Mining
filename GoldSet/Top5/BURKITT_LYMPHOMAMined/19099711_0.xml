<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with Burkitt's and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were registered in Beijing Children Hospital from Feb 2003 to Apr 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry of biopsy, and clinical staging by the examination of imaging, cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow based on St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jude system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensive, short-term chemotherapy witch was modified from LMB89 protocol was given to the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 30 were diagnosed as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and 10 as Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-Ab) was positive in 19 cases at diagnosis, only 7 of the patients were positive for EBER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three of the cases were male and 7 female (M:F = 4.7:1); the median age was 6 years 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequently seen clinical characteristics were abdominal masses and surgical abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine cases were at stage I - II and 31 cases at stage III - IV at diagnosis; <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was involved in 4 cases and bone marrow in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The courses of treatment were approximately 2 - 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were followed up, the median follow-up period was 22.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After chemotherapy, 35 patients (88.7%) were still alive during the one-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 81.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Major toxicity was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> and mucositis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stage III to IV of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> occurred in the most patients with unresected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-involvement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Burkitt's and Burkitt-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are the most common NHL in children with rapid clinical process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Outcome was greatly improved by current intensive, short-term chemotherapy regimen, the 3-year EFS was 81.8% including the patients who were in advanced stage </plain></SENT>
