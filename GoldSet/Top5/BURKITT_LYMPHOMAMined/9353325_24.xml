<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight had received a single treatment with a highly cytotoxic dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remainder, including the previously described RajiF12 cell line, arose following multiple exposures to initially moderate but escalating doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, methylation resistance arose in three clones by reactivation of a previously silent O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five clones, including RajiF12, displayed the microsatellite instability and increased spontaneous mutation rates at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase locus, consistent with deficiencies in mismatch repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defects in either the hMutSalpha or hMutLalpha mismatch repair complexes were identified in extracts of these resistant clones by in vitro complementation using extracts from colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defects in hMutLalpha were confirmed by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, five methylation-resistant clones in which mismatch repair defects were demonstrated by biochemical assays did not exhibit significant microsatellite instability </plain></SENT>
