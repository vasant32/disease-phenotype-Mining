<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients are currently assigned to therapy regimens based on arbitrarily chosen age limits only (eg, 18 or 60 years) and not biologically justified limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 364 diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and related mature aggressive B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> other than Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups were analyzed by comprehensive molecular profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of several biologic features previously reported to be associated with poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, such as ABC subtype, BCL2 expression, or cytogenetic complexity, increases with age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, various genetic features, such as IRF4 translocations, gains in 1q21, 18q21, 7p22, and 7q21, as well as changes in 3q27, including gains and translocations affecting the BCL6 locus, are significantly associated with patient age, but no cut-offs between age groups could be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If age was incorporated in multivariate analyses, genetic complexity lost its prognostic significance, whereas the prognostic impact of ABC subtype and age were additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that aging is a major determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They challenge current concepts regarding both prognostic biomarkers and treatment stratification based on strict age cut-offs </plain></SENT>
