<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas TRAF2, -5, and -6 initiate NF-kappaB activation, the outcomes of TRAF3-initiated signaling are less characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To delineate CD40-induced TRAF3-dependent events, Ramos B cells stably transfected with a dominant negative TRAF3 were stimulated with membranes expressing recombinant CD154/CD40 ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of TRAF3 signaling, activation of p38 and control of Ig production were abrogated, whereas Jun N-terminal kinase activation and secretion of IL-10, lymphotoxin-alpha, and TNF-alpha were partially blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, activation of NF-kappaB, generation of granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and up-regulation of CD54, MHC class II, and CD95 were unaffected by the TRAF3 dominant negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 initiates independent signaling pathways via p38 and JNK that are associated with specific functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
