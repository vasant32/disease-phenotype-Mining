<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the reovirus as a potential therapeutic agent against lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 9 lymphoid cell lines and 27 primary human lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, were tested for susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For in vitro studies, the cells were challenged with reovirus (serotype 3 Dearing), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was assessed by cytopathic effects, viability, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> protein synthesis, and progeny virus production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present evidence of efficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> and cell lysis in the diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines Raji and CA46 but not Daudi, Ramos, or ST486 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when Raji and Daudi cell lines were grown subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient/nonobese diabetic (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>) mice and subsequently injected with reovirus intratumorally or intravenously, significant regression was observed in the Raji-induced, but not the Daudi-induced, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, which is consistent with the in vitro results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reovirus infection</z:e> was also detected in 21 of the 27 primary lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> tested but not in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that reovirus may be an effective agent against several types of human lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
