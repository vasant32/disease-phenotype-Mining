<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Preclinical and cohort studies suggest that certain antidepressants are associated with a predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> whereas others decrease the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess whether different classes of antidepressants were associated with changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence in a population of HIV-1 infected individuals, based on duration of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antidepressant exposure was measured from date of first prescription of the antidepressant until the date of last follow-up or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AIDS-related cancers</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AIDS-related cancers</z:e> according to whether patients were receiving selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi>, or other medicines for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data for time exposed to antidepressants, before and during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a cohort of 10,997 patients representing 52,656 years of follow-up attending a large HIV center during the pre-HAART and HAART eras, a total of 2,004 (18%) were prescribed antidepressants representing 15,850 years exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,607 (15%) individuals were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between any class of antidepressant and any type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (P = .19), in either the pre-HAART or HAART era (P = .23), and use of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors did not alter the risk of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antidepressants, irrespective of their class, do not affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in HIV-infected individuals </plain></SENT>
