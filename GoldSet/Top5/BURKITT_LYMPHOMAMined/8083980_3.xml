<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of different <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> promoters for the expression of the EBNA1 gene product appears to be a critical step in the regulation of Epstein-Barr virus latent gene expression and may reflect the extent of differentiation of B-cell hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low-passage Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines resemble immature B cells in that they express CD10 (CALLA) and do not express B-cell activation antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cells, transcription from a promoter located in the BamHI F fragment of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome results in the exclusive expression of EBNA1, referred to as the latency I pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high-passage Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and lymphoblastoid cell lines resemble activated B cells in that they do not express CD10 but do express activation antigens such as CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cells, the use of two promoters located in the BamHI W and C fragments of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome leads to the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six EBNA gene products (latency III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have found that four human B-cell lines, DB, LBW2, LBW14, and Josh 7, stably express a pattern of B-cell differentiation antigens intermediate between those found in latency I and latency III cell lines and characterized by the coexpression of CD10 and CD23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of EBNA1 promoter usage in these cell lines was examined to determine whether their intermediate <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> was reflected in their patterns of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DB, LBW2, and LBW14 utilize both the BamHI F promoter region and BamHI W promoter region to transcribe the EBNA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This stable pattern of mixed promoter usage for the expression of the EBNA gene products in B cells has not previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, these three B-cell lines expressed lower levels of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latent gene product EBNA2 than those typically observed in latency III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lower levels of activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and cellular promoters known to be regulated by EBNA2 also correlated with the reduced levels of EBNA2 expression in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These included the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> LMP1 and LMP2A promoters and the cellular CD23B promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fourth B-cell line, Josh 7, expressed EBNA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> derived from both the BamHI W promoter and BamHI C promoter, similar to latency III cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The intermediate <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> in Josh 7 cells appeared to be due, in part, to a deficiency in the expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> LMP1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
