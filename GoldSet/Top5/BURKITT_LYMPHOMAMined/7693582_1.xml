<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of the 20-kDa homologous restriction factor (CD59/HRF20), a complement regulatory protein, on two subsets of blood derived B cells and on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both low-density (activated) and high-density (resting) B cell populations expressed high levels of CD59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD59 was detectable, however, only on a minority of cells or not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> on three Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines (BL41, BL28 and DG75) and on clones of an EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> line (Mutu) that phenotypically resembled resting B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CD59 was detected at high or medium levels on Mutu cells which had a lymphoblastoid cell-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD59 was upregulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi>, a drug inhibiting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> methylation, on CD59-negative cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Induction was accompanied by a partial hypomethylation in the 5' region of CD59 coding sequences </plain></SENT>
