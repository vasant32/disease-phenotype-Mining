<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The primary diagnosis of non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (FNA) is still controversial and relatively underused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated our FNA experience with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> using the revised European-American classification of lymphoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> to determine the reliability of FNA when combined with flow cytometry in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, the types of diagnoses made, and the limitations of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Slides and reports from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lymph node and extranodal FNAs performed during the period January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1998, with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or benign lymphoid process were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 290 aspirates from 275 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These included 158 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, of which 86 (54.4%) were primary and 72 (45.6%) were recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 44 aspirates suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 81 benign/reactive diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With diagnoses suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> considered as positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, levels of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 85%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specificity was 100% when only definitive diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, FNA and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry are complementary and obviate a more invasive open biopsy for many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
