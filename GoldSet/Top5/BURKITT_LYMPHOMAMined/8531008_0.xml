<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consistent result is even more difficult to achieve on routine paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic enzyme digestion is most critical for both consistency and sensitivity of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here have investigated the effect of enzyme digestion on cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, protein and DNA reduction, and hybridization efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that enzyme digestion improves efficiency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> through a process involving partial DNA purification on sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a clear relationship between proteolytic enzyme digestion, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> changes, and hybridization efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although detection of DNA sequences in abundance can be achieved within a relatively wide range of digestion levels, maximum hybridization efficiency was always related to the cells, which showed <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of nuclear swollen, weak homogeneous chromatin staining with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and loss of visible nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA in low copy number critically depends on the creation of the morphologic changes by enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The morphological changes would therefore serve as important criteria for optimal digestion, result interpretation, and comparison </plain></SENT>
