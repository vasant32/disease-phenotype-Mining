<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to describe the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected patients controlled in our hospital and to highlight the keys for an early diagnosis considering the variability of immunological disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed and controlled of AT in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were found, including two couples of siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent reason for consultation was unstable gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients suffered repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> the most frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the patients developed Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and another patient, Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, which caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the patient at the age of 11 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were treated with non-specific gamma-globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By the end of the follow-up, 8 patients (ages ranged 7 to 12 years) lost gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic testing was conducted in patients who are still cared for in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion of this entity will lead to an early diagnosis, the treatment of complications, and to provide genetic counselling for the families </plain></SENT>
