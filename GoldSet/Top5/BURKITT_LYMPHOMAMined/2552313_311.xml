<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein are characteristically expressed in B lymphocytes proliferating in vitro in response to growth transformation by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two proteins are thought to be effectors of lymphocyte growth since they increase the expression of B-lymphocyte activation (CD23) and cell-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (LFA 3 and ICAM 1) molecules in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using monoclonal antibody-immune microscopy, we have demonstrated that these two EBV proteins and their associated B-lymphocyte activation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules are expressed in the infiltrating B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients with EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These monoclonal antibodies should be useful in the early diagnosis of EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> and in distinguishing it from other B-lymphocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> associated with EBV, such as Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
