<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, and other nucleated mammalian cells, by neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) triggered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) represents a widely used model system to dissect the PMN cytolytic armamentarium, potentially responsible for the cell damage at tissue sites of PMN activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although oxidants are generally considered to be instrumental in the target lysis by PMNs, the mediators actually involved remain a matter of controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other factors potentially crucial to the lysis have not been clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to reexamine the determinants of the cytolytic process, we studied the events underlying the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-triggered PMN-delivered attack against two different targets, selected on the basis of preliminary experiments (B lymphoblastoid Daudi cells and erythroleukemic K 562 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the lysis is promoted by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>) or a compound with characteristics very similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No evidence was obtained for the intervention or contribution of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> (OH.) radicals, and the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>-derived chloramines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PMNs appeared to use 35% of the generated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> to produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>, while the remainder appears to be consumed by PMNs themselves and target cells as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PMNs and target cells coaggregated at an early step of the cytolytic reaction, through a process efficiently prevented by a monoclonal antibody (MoAb J-90) directed against leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the PMN-target aggregation by the MoAb J-90 resulted in the impairment of the lysis, despite a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> generation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data demonstrate that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-triggered lysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> target cells by PMNs requires at least two events, occurring simultaneously: the LFA-1-mediated effector-target adherence and the PMN production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intervention of the LFA-1-mediated PMN-target adherence in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-triggered lysis is likely to allow PMNs to focus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> on the target cell surface and suggests that the process requires a sort of molecule to molecule recognition at the effector-target surface level </plain></SENT>
