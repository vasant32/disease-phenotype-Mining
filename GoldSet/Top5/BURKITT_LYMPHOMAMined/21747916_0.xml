<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Mdm2-p53 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression pathway plays a vital role in regulating cellular homeostasis by integrating a variety of stressors and eliciting effects on cell growth and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated an in vivo signaling pathway mediated by ribosomal protein (RP)-Mdm2 interaction that responds to ribosome biogenesis stress and evokes a protective p53 reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that mice harboring a Cys-to-Phe mutation in the zinc finger of Mdm2 that specifically disrupts RP L11-Mdm2 binding are prone to accelerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphomagenesis</z:e> in an oncogenic c-Myc driven mouse model of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because most oncogenes when upregulated simultaneously promote both cellular growth and proliferation, it therefore stands to reason that the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway might also be essential in response to oncogenes other than c-Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using genetically engineered mice, we now show that disruption of the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway by an Mdm2(C305F) mutation does not accelerate prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> induced by inactivation of the pRb family proteins (pRb/p107/p130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, loss of p19Arf greatly accelerates the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> induced by inhibition of pRb family proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using ectopically expressed oncogenic H-Ras we demonstrate that p53 response remains intact in the Mdm2(C305F) mutant MEF cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, unlike the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 pathway, which is considered a general oncogenic response pathway, the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway appears to specifically suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> induced by oncogenic c-Myc </plain></SENT>
