<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Membrane fractions of the EBV-carrying Raji cells and a fusion protein (LMFP), that represents the carboxy part of LMP, were used as antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were assayed by the reduction of the leukocyte migration inhibition (LMI) reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactivity with LMFP was detected in 10 of 14 sera from patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and in 3 of 23 sera from healthy EBV-seropositive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibody levels were higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells do not express LMP, this may be due to the high virus load in the patients </plain></SENT>
