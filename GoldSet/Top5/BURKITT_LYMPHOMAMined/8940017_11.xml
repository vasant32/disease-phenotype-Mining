<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified p52 Shc in the FcgammaRIIb1-specific immunoprecipitates isolated from the membrane fraction of BL41 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells following B cell receptor-FcgammaRIIb1 co-ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insolubilized synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> representing the phosphorylated form of the tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of FcgammaRIIb also binds Shc from the lysates of activated but not from resting BL41 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the binding does not depend on the interaction of FcgammaRIIb1-phosphotyrosine with the SH2 domain of Shc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tyr phosphorylation of FcgammaRIIb1-associated Shc is low, indicating an impaired function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shc is implicated in regulating p21(ras) activation; thus, we have compared p21(ras) activities in BL41 cells treated in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p21(ras) activity is reduced when B cell receptor and FcgammaRIIb1 are co-ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p21(ras) couples protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent events to the Ser/Thr kinase-mediated signaling pathway leading to the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that B cell receptor-FcgammaRIIb1 co-cross-linking partially inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FcgammaRIIb1-dependent inhibition of human B cell activation may be based on interrupting signal transduction between protein-tyrosine kinases and the p21(ras)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase-dependent activation pathway </plain></SENT>
