<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was isolated in the 1960s from the African <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368871" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood tumor</z:e>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>), characterized by the translocation of the c-myc gene into one of the immunoglobulin loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the extreme discrepancy between the widespread dissemination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and the overall rarity of EBV-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, it remains an open question whether EBV is really a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> virus, and if so, what specific contribution EBV may have to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Protein binding at the EBER locus of EBV was analyzed by genomic footprinting electrophoretic mobility shift, reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation in a panel of six B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several novel in vivo protein binding sites were found in the EBER locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among those, a prominent binding site, 130 base pairs upstream of the EBER1 gene, contains two E-boxes providing a consensus sequence for binding of the transcription factor and oncoprotein c-Myc to the EBV genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the discovery of a binding site for c-Myc in the EBV genome, a new molecular model for the specific role of EBV as a causal factor in the origin of endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> is proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Translocated and deregulated c-myc directly activates and maintains the antiapoptotic functions of the EBER locus in a single EBV-infected B cell undergoing the germinal center (GC) reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the balance shifted towards cell survival, the oncogenic potential of the pro-apoptotic c-Myc protein is unmasked in the translocated GC cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This single translocated and surviving cell is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> cell of an endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The new model reinstitutes EBV as a real human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> virus </plain></SENT>
