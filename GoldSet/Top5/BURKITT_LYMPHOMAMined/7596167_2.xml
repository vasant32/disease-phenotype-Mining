<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 7 (IL-7) stimulates proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human and murine B cell precursor (BCP) cells in a distinct fashion, depending on the stage of maturation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For instance, the productive rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene has been demonstrated to be essential for the response of BCP cells to IL-7 as the single proliferation stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-7 activates a receptor that consists of the IL-7R protein and the common gamma chain (gamma c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCP <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (BCP-ALL) cells variably respond to IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 72 cases of BCP-ALL IL-7 activated DNA synthesis in 34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four cases inhibition of DNA synthesis was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 38 cases IL-7 exerted no effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined whether this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in IL-7 response could be correlated with parameters that could influence the IL-7 response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Firstly we show that, in contrast to the murine BCP cells, the IL-7 response of human BCP-ALL cells did not correlate with the status of IgH chain gene rearrangement and expression, nor with the rearrangement of IgL chain genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, it is demonstrated that IL-7R protein and transcripts as well as gamma c transcripts are equally present in the IL-7 responsive and nonresponsive BCP-ALL samples, indicating that the defective expression of these chains could not be held responsible for IL-7 response failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed that kit ligand (KL), known to synergize with IL-7 in the most primitive stages of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cell development, did not enhance the IL-7 responses of BCP-ALL cells </plain></SENT>
