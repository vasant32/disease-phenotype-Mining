<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Expression density and function of Fas (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-1/CD95) on malignant B-cells, an antigen thought responsible for abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biology, remains to be fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five cases with B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (HCL), B-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (MM) were studied for qualitative and quantitative expression and function of Fas using flow cytometry and annexin-V staining methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fas expression was flow cytometrically unimodal with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> density and showed quantitatively characteristic features among different diseases; weak in ALL, faint in CLL, moderate in HCL, and strong in ML, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not only full-length but also alternatively spliced truncated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were detected even in leukemic B-cells with qualitatively faint or negative Fas, and then band density of the former transcripts by RT-PCR was correlated to the Fas protein expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term culture of freshly isolated cells gave rise to increases of Fas density and susceptibility for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and inducible Fas are functional at least in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that Fas is a biological marker for characterizing B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> reflecting various stages of B-cell ontogeny and may have clinical utility as a therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
