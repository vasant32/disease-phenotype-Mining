<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the antiapoptotic function and chemoprotective effects of Bcl-2, it represents a rational target for modulation using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in Bcl-2-expressing, EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a fully phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to the first six codons of Bcl-2, we examined the effects of Bcl-2 antisense both in vitro in LCLs and in vivo in the human/severe combined immunodeficient chimeric model of EBV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro treatment of LCLs with Bcl-2 antisense in the presence of cationic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> was associated with decreased expression of Bcl-2 protein, inhibition of proliferation, and stimulation of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; these effects were sequence-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, treatment of LCL-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice with Bcl-2 antisense but not control oligodeoxynucleotides completely prevented or significantly delayed the development of fatal EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides mediate sequence-dependent antitumor effects in EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferations both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Bcl-2 antisense therapy may represent a novel antitumor treatment strategy for EBV-associated PTLDs and other Bel-2-expressing, EBV-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
