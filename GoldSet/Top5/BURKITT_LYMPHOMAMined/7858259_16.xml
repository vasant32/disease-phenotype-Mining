<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RAGs are normally expressed during a narrow window of precursor lymphocyte development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RAG expression was examined in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No steady-state RAG <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was found in EBV immortalized cells, including newly established B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from precursor lymphocytes that transcribed RAGs at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RAG <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were detected in some endemic (EBV+) and also in some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> (EBV-) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines that had been infected with EBV in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RAG+, EBV+ Burkitt's lines were unusual in that they were SIgM+ (one was SIgG+, SIgM-), CD10+, and lacked terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In EBV+ Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines, transcription of virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) was correlated with downregulation of RAG-1 and RAG-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, absence of LMP-1 in clones of EBV+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lines was associated with increased RAG transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Translocation of c-myc into V(D)J loci has been observed in endemic Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, and heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences have been identified at some chromosomal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Association of RAG transcription with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> raises the possibility that, under certain conditions, virus might predispose to aberrant V(D)J recombination reactions </plain></SENT>
