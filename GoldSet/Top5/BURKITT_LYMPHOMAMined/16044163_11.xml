<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found ARK5 expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines expressing c-MAF and MAFB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, gene expression profiling of 351 clinical specimens revealed ARK5 expression in primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> expressing c-MAF and MAFB, suggesting that ARK5 may be a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the ARK5 gene promoter revealed that it contains two putative MAF-recognition element (MARE) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, ARK5 was induced when an MAFB or c-MAF expression vector was introduced into non-ARK5-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ARK5 promoter activity was dramatically decreased by mutation or deletion of MARE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed an interaction between the Large-MAF family proteins and MARE sequences in the ARK5 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in ARK5 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> lines, but not in ARK5-negative lines, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 increased invasion activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IGF-1-induced invasion was reproduced when ARK5 was overexpressed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on results, we conclude that ARK5 is a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family through MARE sequence and that ARK5 may in part mediate the aggressive phenotype associated with c-MAF- and MAFB-expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
