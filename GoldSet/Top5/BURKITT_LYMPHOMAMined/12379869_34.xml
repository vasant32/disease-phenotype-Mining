<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We show that iterative antigen-mediated selection of B-cell lines that constitutively hypermutate their immunoglobulin V genes during culture can be exploited to generate antibodies in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From Ramos, a hypermutating human B-cell line expressing IgM of unknown specificity, we derived descendants that exhibit stepwise improved binding to streptavidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding is initially conferred by mutations in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), but maturation is due to strategic framework mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A more powerful system is provided by a hypermutating chicken B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line, owing to its rapid proliferation, high rate of mutation accumulation, and genetic tractability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Starting from a single cell, we selected parallel lineages of derivatives, making mutated antibodies of increasing affinity to independent test antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selection is initiated at an exceedingly low affinity threshold, but antibodies can be delivered with nanomolar affinities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strategy could prove useful for in vitro generation of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and may be extendable to the maturation of other protein-ligand interactions </plain></SENT>
