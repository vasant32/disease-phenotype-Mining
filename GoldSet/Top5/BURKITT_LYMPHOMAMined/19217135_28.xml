<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of BHRF1 miRNAs is dependent on the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> latency, whereas the BART miRNAs are expressed in cells during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forms of latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is not known how these miRNAs are otherwise regulated, though </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have used quantitative, stem-loop, real-time PCR to measure the expression of EBV's miRNAs and found them to differ nearly 50- and 25-fold among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested cell lines and among EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of individual BART miRNAs within a cell can differ by 50-fold or more despite the fact these miRNAs are likely transcribed together as a single primary transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These measurements are illuminating: they indicate that few of EBV's miRNAs are expressed at levels comparable to those of cellular miRNAs in most cell lines and therefore likely function interdependently </plain></SENT>
