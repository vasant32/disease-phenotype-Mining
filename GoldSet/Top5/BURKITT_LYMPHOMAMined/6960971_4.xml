<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surface marker studies revealed a monoclonal immunoglobulin A (sIgA) with a lambda chain (74%) on the PB cells in a sample containing 74% blast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A table summarizing the cases with variant translocations in Burkitt diseases [Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) and ALL-L3] is presented, and review of the published data indicates that, generally, the survival of patients with t(8;22)-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> and ALL-L3 is short and comparable to that of patients with the more common translocation, t(8;14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no relationship between t(2;8) or t(8;22) and a specific heavy-chain sIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes of the BM cells and those of the long-term cultured PB cells, though retaining t(8;22), differed from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analyses using cells from long-term culture may reveal karyotypic changes in addition to those seen on direct analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The key karyotypic anomaly in Burkitt-type diseases appears to be the breakage of chromosome #8 at band q24 </plain></SENT>
