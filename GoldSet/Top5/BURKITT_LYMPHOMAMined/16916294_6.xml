<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS) lesions are now causally associated with KSHV/HHV-8 but whether African ARL shows this association is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> registry data was reviewed for retrospective cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both retrospective and prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases were classified according to the revised European-American (REAL) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunephenotyping was performed on both frozen and fixed paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> DNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of formalin fixed or frozen biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) was used to determine the presence of EBV encoded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (EBER) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> related malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in Tanzania and a possible co-association with KSHV/HHV-8 and EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An overall increasing tendency for ML in Tanzania was observed during 1991-94 and a clear increase from 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were classified as Burkitt's (6), diffuse large cell (10), precursor-B lymphoblastic (1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (5) from HIV positive and negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten (40%) high grade ML and three Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from HIV patients had HHV-8 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings were not related to age, sex or type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no association of HHV-8 with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was demonstrable in most (13/18; 72%) of the tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and seven (31.8%) had both HHV-8 and EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an overall increased frequency of ML patients infected with HHV-8 in Tanzania particularly in HIV patients which may result from the well established high HHV-8 prevalence in the general population, but HHV-8 was not associated with ARL pathogenesis as reflected by lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As opposed to EBV, measures targeting HHV-8 for control of ML may therefore not be appropriate </plain></SENT>
