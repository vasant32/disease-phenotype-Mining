<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between leukemic cell growth in this model and the treatment outcome in patients from whom cells were derived has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukemic cells from 42 children with newly diagnosed high-risk B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were inoculated intravenously into CB.17 <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were killed at 12 weeks or when they became moribund as a result of disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mice were necropsied and subjected to a series of laboratory studies to assess their burden of human leukemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients whose leukemic cells caused histopathologically detectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice had a significantly higher relapse rate than the 19 patients whose leukemic cells did not (estimated 5-year event-free survival: 29.5% v 94.7%; 95% confidence intervals, 11.2% to 50.7% v 68.1% to 99.2%; P &lt; .0001 by log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was was a highly significant predictor of patient relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated instantaneous risk of relapse for patients whose leukemic cells caused overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice was 21.5-fold greater than that for the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, growth of human leukemic cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice is a strong and independent predictor of relapse in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
