<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed an early increase of PIC activity detectable within 90 min of interferon treatment concomitant with an increase of diacylglcerol (DAG) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the interferon-induced DAG production is not modified by the addition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, a compound known to inhibit production of DAG from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> hydrolysis, it is suggested that the interferon antiproliferative signal is transduced into the nucleus via the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A parallel analysis performed on intact cells showed a rapid inhibition of PIC activity accompanied by an increase of DAG level thus suggesting that interferon-generated signals at plasma-membrane level use pathways different from that of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A selected clone of Daudi cells resistant to interferon action provided a control for specificity of results </plain></SENT>
