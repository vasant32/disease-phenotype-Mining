<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their induction in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Akata cells is directly targeted by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, BCR stimulation causes an outwardly directed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(*-)) burst leading to massive generation of reactive oxygen species in the cell environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate the role of BCR-related redox changes in the IE reactivation of EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(*-) by stimulated Akata cells was characterized using chemiluminescent dyes, lucigenin, MCLA, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2311">coelenterazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the EBV IE genes was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Catalase activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> concentration were evaluated using Amplex Red assays and by measuring light absorption at 240 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show here that elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> concentration in Akata cell suspensions inhibits the induction of the virus IE <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and BZLF1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was further found that Akata cells exhibit catalase-like activity that is stimulated by BCR cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results reveal that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> is instrumental in the maintenance of EBV latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether they provide new evidence demonstrating the essential role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> in BCR signaling </plain></SENT>
