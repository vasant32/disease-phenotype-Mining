<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ig heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of diagnostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples from 91 patients (57 children and 34 adults, with cut-off at age 16) with precursor B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using primers directed to the framework regions (FR) 1, 2 and 3 of the IgH gene, clonal IgH rearrangements were observed in 82, 58 and 58%, respectively, whereas clonality was presented in 45 and 27% using primers hybridising to the TCR delta and gamma genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five primer sets used resulted in 96% positive cases (children 100%, adults 88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clonal IgH rearrangements correlated to patient age with a significantly lower fraction of positive cases in the adult group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concomitant usage of more than one V(H) family gene was similar for childhood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e>, and an over-representation of V(H)6 rearrangements was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023452" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood ALL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five out of 91 cases (27%) displayed an oligoclonal pattern for either IgH or TCR gene rearrangements (children 37%, adults 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparative analysis of samples from different compartments was performed in 23 patients, and differences between two or three compartments were observed in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly large, clonally appearing PCR products of 540-715 bp were found in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and sequence analysis verified their clonal nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, using multiple sets of primers clonal rearrangements of IgH and TCR genes can be detected in a very high frequency, including previously neglected large size PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was demonstrated in different compartments reflecting ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, which can make detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) in ALL troublesome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that a minimum of three targets should be used to minimise false-negative results </plain></SENT>
