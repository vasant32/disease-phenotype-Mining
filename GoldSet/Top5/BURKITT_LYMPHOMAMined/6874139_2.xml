<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The typical 14q+ chromosome in the t(8;14) and the two "variant translocations", the 2q+ in the t(2;8) and the small 22q- in the t(8;22), could be identified as single peaks within the flow karyotypes of metaphase chromosomes isolated from several different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-lines for each translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The translocation chromosomes could be separated with a high degree of purity and in quantities suitable for biochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same analytical and preparative technique was also successfully applied to the identification and sorting of the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome in a 9;22 translocation-carrying <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-derived line and a familial (11;22) translocation </plain></SENT>
