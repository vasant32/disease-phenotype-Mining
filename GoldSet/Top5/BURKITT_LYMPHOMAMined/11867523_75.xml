<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether Epstein--Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> could counteract the antitumor effect of interferon (IFN)-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-negative subclones isolated from EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines Akata, Daudi and Mutu were found to fall into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after IFN-alpha treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EBV-positive counterparts exhibited striking resistance against IFN-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection of an individual EBV latent gene into EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells revealed that EBV-encoded poly(A)(-) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) were responsible for IFN resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBERs bound double-stranded (ds) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (PKR), a key mediator of the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha, and inhibited its phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of dominant-negative PKR, which was catalytically inactive and could block phosphorylation of endogenous PKR, made EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells resistant to IFN-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, EBERs did not bind mutant PKR, which was catalytically active but lacked dsRNA-binding activity, nor did they inhibit its phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that EBERs confer resistance to IFN-alpha-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via binding to PKR and inhibition of its phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report that the virus counteracts IFN-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in virus-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
