<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While evaluating the role of iron-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> on the in vitro uptake of 67Ga and 59Fe by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells, it was observed that these radiometals bind to <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> culture tubes in the presence of transferrin or lactoferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amount of 67Ga or 59Fe bound to the tube increases with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> concentrations up to 20 microgram/ml and decreases thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This biphasic response is a reflection of metal-protein affinity and is greatest for 59Fe-lactoferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With 125I-labeled transferrin and lactoferrin, the amount of tube-bound radioactivity was inversely dependent on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> concentration suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> bind to a limited number of binding sites on the tube wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10(13) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> molecules were bound per tube with an affinity constant of 1.89 X 10(7) 1/M for transferrin and 1.08 X 10(7) l/M for lactoferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These sites are not specific since addition of albumin inhibited the binding of radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> to the tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the light of these observations, caution is required in interpreting results of cell culture experiments which have not directed attention to protein-plastic interaction </plain></SENT>
