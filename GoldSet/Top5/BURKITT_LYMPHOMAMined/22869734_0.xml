<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> are characterized by recurrent translocations between a tissue-specific gene and a proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The juxtaposition of the Ig heavy chain gene and Myc in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> is a classic example </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regulatory elements within the heavy chain constant region locus are required for Myc translocation and/or deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, many genes are regulated by cis-acting elements at distances up to 1,000 kb outside the locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such putative distal elements have not been examined for the heavy chain locus, particularly in the context of Myc translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that a transgene containing the Ig heavy chain constant region locus, inserted into five different chromosomal locations, can undergo translocations involving Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these translocations are able to generate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytomas</z:hpo> in each transgenic line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the heavy chain constant region locus itself includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the elements necessary for both the translocation and the deregulation of the proto-oncogene </plain></SENT>
