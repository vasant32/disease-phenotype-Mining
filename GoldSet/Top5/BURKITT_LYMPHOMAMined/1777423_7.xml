<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">Glycolipids</z:chebi>, made up of a carbohydrate chain attached to a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> called <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>, are classified in four main 'series' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These series are defined according to the identity and chemical bonding of the <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> closest to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> moiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pre-B cell lines contained lacto-series type II chain-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> and II3-alpha-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-neuraminosyllactosylceramide (GM3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon differentiation, the lacto-series synthesis was shut down whereas compounds of the globo-series appeared: resting lymphocytes and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) expressed GM3, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), and globoside (Gb4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a later stage of B cell differentiation, biosynthesis of the ganglio-series was extended and <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells expressed II3-alpha-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-neuraminosylgangliotriosylceramide (GM2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the cell surface, in addition to Gb3, that we previously described as specifically expressed on Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and on a subset of germinal centre tonsillar B cells, two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi> seemed specific of certain B cell lines: Gb4 was strongly positive on six out of eight LCLs and on the low buoyant density fraction of tonsillar B lymphocytes, whereas GM2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> was only detected on the two <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results, demonstrating the stage-dependent expression of certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipids</z:chebi>, suggest that these carbohydrate molecules could play functional roles during B cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
