<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, chimeric (c) divalent (cHD37) and tetravalent (cHD37-DcVV) anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were constructed, expressed and evaluated for their binding to human 19-positive (CD19(+)) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were also tested for proapoptotic activity and the ability to mediate effector functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antitumor activity of these MAbs was further tested in mice xenografted with the CD19(+) Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Daudi or the pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell line, NALM-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs exhibited specific binding and comparable proapoptotic activity on CD19(+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs were similar in their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the tetravalent cHD37-DcVV MAb bound more avidly, had a slower dissociation rate, and did not internalize as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also had enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with human but not murine effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs exhibited comparable affinity for the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and similar pharmacokinetics (PKs) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the HD37 constructs were similar in extending the survival of mice xenografted with Daudi or NALM-6 tumor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cHD37 and cHD37-DcVV MAbs have potent antitumor activity and should be further developed for use in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although not evident in mice, due to its increased ability to mediate ADCC with human but not mouse effector cells, the cHD37-DcVV MAb should have superior therapeutic efficacy in humans </plain></SENT>
