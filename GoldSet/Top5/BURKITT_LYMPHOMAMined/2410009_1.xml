<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The blood group specificity of a rat IgM monoclonal antibody (38-13) directed against most EBV-positive or -negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target antigen was previously identified as the neutral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> trihexoside (CTH), a substance which accumulates in red cells from very rare individuals of the Pk phenotype and which appears as a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of the P blood group antigen (globoside) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 38-13 antibody agglutinated Pk1 and Pk2 red cells at 4 degrees C with a very high titre but was inactive against native P1, P2 and p erythrocytes, although a very weak activity was noticed towards papain-treated P1 and P2 erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed by an indirect radio-binding assay which also demonstrated that the 38-13 antibody reacted with lymphocytes, fibroblasts and EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Pk1 and Pk2 individuals but not from other donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that the 38-13 monoclonal antibody previously considered as specific of Burkitt cells could be routinely used as an anti-Pk blood group typing reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of CTH accumulation in Burkitt cells and Pk red cells is probably different and might be associated respectively with the activation of an alpha-4-galactosyltransferase or the genetic blockage of a beta-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase </plain></SENT>
