<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In murine B-cells the inhibition is mediated by the interaction of the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (P-ITIM) of Fc gammaRIIb1 with the SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of Fc gammaRIIb mediated inhibition of human B-cells we have studied the association of signaling molecules with human Fc gammaRIIb1 after co-ligating with BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fc gammaRIIb1 were affinity purified from the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, BL41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were co-isolated with Fc gammaRIIb1 at 145, 110, and 50 60 kDa, which were not present in Fc gammaRIIb1 free immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these molecules we have identified the p52 Shc adaptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have shown that the insolubilised synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding P-ITIM bound Shc, Lyn and the p75 and p 10 unidentified tyrosine phosphorylated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we describe that the cell membrane associated Shc is partially dephosphorylated in BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1 co-ligated samples, suggesting that its function in regulating p21ras monomeric G protein is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we have detected a lower p21ras activity in BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1 co-crosslinked samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that co-ligation of BCR and Fc gammaRIIb1 interrupts signal transduction between protein tyrosine kinase activation and p21ras mediated activation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since in contrast to the mouse B-cells both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 are expressed in human B-cells, we have investigated the inhibitory function of the two receptors in Fc gammaRIIb negative Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line ST486 transfected with Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 inhibited the rise of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> induced by the crosslinking of BCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of the inhibition depended on the ratio of the co-crosslinked receptors (BCR-Fc gammaRIIb1) to the crosslinked BCR (BCR-BCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Co-crosslinking of the two receptors inhibited not only the capacitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry but rather the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response in both Fc gammaRIIb1 and Fc gammaRIIb2 transfected human B-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CD19 represents the signal transduction unit of complement receptor, CR2 (CD21), and is responsible for the complement activating IgM-immune complex induced enhancement of B-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Co-crosslinking of CD19 and BCR was shown to enhance B-cell activation due to the recruitment of further signaling molecules to the activator complex by the phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32789">tyrosine residues</z:chebi> of CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Here we show a novel finding that co-ligation of CD19 with Fc gammaRIIb1 inhibits the CD19-induced upregulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that IgG plus complement containing immune complexes may inhibit B-cell activation in vivo, due to the Fc gammaRIIb1-mediated interruption of signal transduction via both BCR and CD19 </plain></SENT>
