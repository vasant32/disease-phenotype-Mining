<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 13 cell lines (including six derivea from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two from leukaemic leukocytes) only one, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>-derived, Epstein-Barr virus-producing line QIMR-WIL, showed any activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nature of the QIMR-WIL particles was further defined by isolation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>-labelled 70S <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and by the simultaneous assay for reverse transcriptase and 70S <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, but production of such particles was detected in only three of 10 assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of cells with 5'-iododeoxyuridine or culture in arginine-free medium did not induce particle production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Syncytia assays using XC cells were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 13 primary cultures (nine samples of leukaemic leukocytes and four of cord leukocytes) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and subjected to inducing conditions, one (leukocytes from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>) showed evidence in successive assays of oncornavirus synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low and transient yield of oncornavirus-like particles obtained in this work parallels that reported in previous studies of fresh lymphoid cells and primary cultures </plain></SENT>
