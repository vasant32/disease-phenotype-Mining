<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency-associated gene expression is associated with cell cycle progression, the relationship between the EBV lytic program and the cell cycle is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using four different EBV lytic induction systems, we address the relationship between lytic cycle activation and the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three of these systems, G0 or G1 cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> signaling is observed prior to detection of the EBV immediate-early gene product Zta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">tetradecanoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>-treated P3HR1 cultures and in 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine-treated NPC-KT cultures, cell cycle analysis of Zta-expressing cell populations showed a significant G1 bias during the early stages of lytic cycle progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, treatment of the cell line Akata with anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) results in rapid induction of immediate-early gene expression, and accordingly, activation of the immediate-early gene product Zta precedes significant anti-Ig-induced cell cycle effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, cell cycle analysis of the Zta-expressing population following anti-Ig treatment shows a bias for cells in G1, indicating that anti-Ig-mediated induction of Zta occurs more efficiently in cells traversing G1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Last, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> treatment of Rael cells results in a G1 arrest in the total cell population which precedes the induction of Zta, cell cycle analysis of the Zta-expressing population shows a significant bias for cells with an apparent G2/M DNA content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This bias may result, in part, from activation of Zta expression following demethylation of the Zta promoter during S-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these studies indicate that induction of Zta occurs through several distinct mechanisms, some of which may involve checkpoint signaling </plain></SENT>
