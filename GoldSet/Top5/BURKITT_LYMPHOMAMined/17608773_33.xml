<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c13orf25/miR-17 cluster, which is responsible for 13q31-q32 amplification in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, contains the microRNA-17-18-19-20-92 polycistron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous study demonstrated that this polycistron could modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation following transplantation of microRNA 17-19b into Eu-myc mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another study reported that Myc can upregulate the miR-17 cluster by binding directly upstream of the miR-17 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Myc and the miR-17 cluster synergistically contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the study presented here, we observed recurrent 13q31-32 amplification in MYC-rearranged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (11 of 47 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of c13orf25 for MYC-rearranged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> demonstrated that cases with 13q31-32 amplification showed significantly higher expression of c13orf25 than cases without such amplification, although cases without 13q31-32 amplification still showed slight upregulation of c13orf25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relationship between Myc and the miR-17 polycistron in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, we engineered rat fibroblasts (Rat-1) that constitutively express the miR-17 polycistron (miR), Myc, or both miR and Myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest level of miR expression was detected in Rat-1 transfected with both miR and Myc, whereas Myc transfectant cells alone also showed slight upregulation of miR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice injected with Rat-1 transfected with both miR and Myc presented more accelerated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> than those injected with Myc transfectant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that miR is stably upregulated in the presence of constitutive expression of Myc, and that the deregulation of miR and Myc synergistically contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262472" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">aggressive cancer</z:e> development, probably by repressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor genes </plain></SENT>
