<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells, however, contain <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> hybridizing to a cloned human beta2m cDNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>cDNA from this Daudi beta2m <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, was cloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By comparison with cDNA prepared from Ramos cells, which synthesized microglobulin, we determined the sequence of the 20 amino acid long leader <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of pre-beta2m and show that in Daudi cells the initiator ATG has been mutated to ATC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although Daudi beta2m <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> cannot be translated, interferon induces the beta2m <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in Daudi cells as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cells </plain></SENT>
