<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rates in developing countries are much lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Franco-African <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Childhood Cancer</z:e> Group (French acronym, GFAOP) was founded in 2000 with aim of reducing this unfavorable situation in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GFAOP has developed two forms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main form consists of organizing two- to twelve-month training sessions for physicians and nurses in France and Morocco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other form involves assessing the feasibility of modern treatment protocols for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first feasibility trials were carried out on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 12 pilot units in North Africa, West Africa, and Madagascar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first study from 2001 to 2005 we treated 306 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> using French LMB protocols adapted to the African setting and achieved a survival rate of 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second study started in 2005 using Endoxan alone achieved a highly satisfactory survival rate of 73% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages except bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether from 2001 to 2007 more than 1000 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002667'>nephroblastoma</z:hpo> and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were treated in African hospitals by African doctors and nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients were transferred to Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The GFAOP supplied drugs when necessary and took care of most travel expenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>African and French doctors worked together on protocol design, trial management, and data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These promising results show that the latest therapeutic techniques can be used to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> in Africa by adapting the protocol to conditions in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sanofi-Aventis Laboratories in association with the International Union against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> has launched a major campaign to improve Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> in developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Projects in four GFAOP units are being financed through this campaign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 2006 the GFAOP began assessment of two new treatment protocols, i.e., one for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and the other for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Two other projects are being planned, i.e., one for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> and the other for treatment of some types of <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
