<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi has the phenotype of a nonsecreting B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cell line synthesizes both the membrane and secreted forms of the IgM heavy chain, but only expresses functional membrane IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have found that secreted type heavy chains (mus) are rapidly degraded in these cells, with a half-life of 1.3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the membrane type heavy chains (mum) are also rapidly catabolized but some are expressed in a stable form with a half-life of 13 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting the initial glycosylation of heavy chains with tunicamycin has differential effects on the catabolic rates of mus and mum chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The turnover of mus chains is not affected by this inhibitor, but the degradation of mum chains is much more rapid after tunicamycin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with their glycosylated counterparts, nonglycosylated mu chains do not covalently assemble to a significant degree with light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tunicamycin treatment of Daudi cells thus seems to inhibit formation of stable mum protein, possibly by altering mu chain conformation and inhibiting its interaction with light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude from these results that some mum chains are specifically protected from proteolysis by post-translational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These processing events include covalent assembly with light chains, terminal glycosylation, and insertion into the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
