<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tasidotin, an oncolytic drug in phase II clinical trials, is a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> analog of the antimitotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23643">depsipeptide</z:chebi> dolastatin 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In tasidotin, the carboxyl-terminal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> group of dolastatin 15 has been replaced by a carboxy-terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30355">tert-butyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As expected from studies with cemadotin, [(3)H]tasidotin, with the radiolabel in the second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32874">proline residue</z:chebi>, was hydrolyzed intracellularly, with formation of N,N-dimethylvalyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32861">valyl</z:chebi>-N-methylvalyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi>-proline (P5), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48545">pentapeptide</z:chebi> also present in dolastatin 15 and cemadotin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P5 was more active as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and less active as a cytotoxic agent than tasidotin, cemadotin, and dolastatin 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[(3)H]P5 was not the end product of tasidotin metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large amounts of [(3)H]proline were formed in every cell line studied, with proline ultimately becoming the major radiolabeled product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The putative second product of the hydrolysis of P5, N,N-dimethylvalyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32861">valyl</z:chebi>-N-methylvalyl-proline (P4), had little activity as either an antitubulin or cytotoxic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven suspension cell lines, the cytotoxicity of tasidotin correlated with total cell uptake of the compound and was probably affected negatively by the extent of degradation of P5 to proline and, presumably, P4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intracellular enzyme <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> oligopeptidase probably degrades tasidotin to P5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When CCRF-CEM human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells were treated with N-benzyloxycarbonylprolylprolinal (BCPP), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26274,32874">prolyl</z:chebi> oligopeptidase, there was a 30-fold increase in the IC(50) of tasidotin and a marked increase in intracellular [(3)H]tasidotin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BCPP also caused a 4-fold increase in the IC(50) of P5, so the enzyme probably does not convert P5 to P4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting degradation of P5 should have led to a decrease in the IC(50) obtained for P5 in the presence of BCPP </plain></SENT>
