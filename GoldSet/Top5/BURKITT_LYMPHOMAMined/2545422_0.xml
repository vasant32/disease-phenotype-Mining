<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of five Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-converted sublines of an EBV-negative Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41) was identified as a non-tumorigenic phenotypic <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> with low clonability, comparable to that of an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (IARC-171) derived from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> subline (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>-41/95) also showed the most LCL-like phenotype of the five convertants tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that reversion was due to the phenotypic shift of the cell from a 'window' of cell ontogeny that contains virgin B cells and memory B cells to the stage of the activated immunoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constitutive activation of the c-myc gene by translocation to an immunoglobulin locus continues to drive proliferation of B cells in vivo even after they have undergone a programmed switch to a basically resting (virgin or memory cell) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An activated immunoblast invariably expresses c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also suggested that proliferation of the activated immunoblast is regulated by negative host controls that prevent clonal overexpansion and keep the B cell pool constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the immunoblast to this control overrides the 'forward-driving' force of both EBV and the activated myc gene </plain></SENT>
