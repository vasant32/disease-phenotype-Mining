<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blast cells from the peripheral blood or bone marrow of adult patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were analyzed for in vitro responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> agents in terms of suppression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> precursor (3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>, 3H-deoxyuridine) incorporation into the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, the in vitro data were compared to the clinical response of the patients to polychemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the majority of patients, in vitro cytotoxic effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and ara-C reflected the in vivo situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of in vitro inhibition that could distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant diseases appeared to be 30% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> and 20% for ara-C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> effect in vitro and the proliferative state of the leukemic cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial in vitro testing during the course of the disease of various patients proved the ability of the test system to detect acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies with established cell lines (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, Raji) indicated that the short-term test in its present form is probably not suited to monitor the effect of drug combinations in vitro </plain></SENT>
