<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The introduction of rituximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> therapeutic schemes has been scarcely explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome and toxicity of HIV-positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> treated in a rituximab and intensive chemotherapy-based trial was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients, 15 to 55 years of age, diagnosed with advanced stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> were recruited from July 2003 to August 2006, stratified according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> status and treated with 6 cycles of intensive chemotherapy including 8 doses of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen of the patients (53%) were HIV-infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their clinical characteristics were comparable to those of the HIV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete remission (CR) rates were 88% and 84%, respectively, for HIV-negative and -positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (82% and 68%, respectively, for HIV-negative and -positive patients) completed the 6 protocol scheduled cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HIV-infected patients presented higher incidences of grade 3-4 mucositis (27% vs 7% of cycles, P = .0005) and severe infectious episodes (26% vs 8%, P = .0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there were no statistically significant differences in 2-year overall survival (82%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 65%-99% and 73%, 95% CI, 54%-92%, respectively) or 2-year disease-free survival (93%, 95% CI, 82%-99% and 87%, 95% CI 72%-99%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive immunochemotherapy can be administered safely to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite a higher incidence of severe mucositis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> the remission and survival rates are comparable to those observed in HIV-negative patients </plain></SENT>
