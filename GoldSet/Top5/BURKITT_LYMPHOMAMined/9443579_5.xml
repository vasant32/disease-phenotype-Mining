<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated TNF alpha gene expression and protein secretion in a human monocytic cell line, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1, and a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> B-cell line, Namalwa, in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) (100 ng/ml for 48 h) induced TNF alpha secretion in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 and Namalwa cells (100 to 300 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> cells, the optimum response (&gt; 2000 pg/ml) was obtained in the presence of a second mitogenic signal such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) (10 microg/ml for 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our activation conditions, Northern blot analysis revealed a marked accumulation of TNF alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species at 1.7 kb in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>+LPS-stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells were exposed to HBV, TNF alpha protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> significantly decreased (&gt; 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, HBV exposure of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-activated Namalwa cells resulted in strongly increased TNF alpha protein secretion (1 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, HBV induced TNF alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation that consisted of two types: a regular 1.7 kb and two novel high molecular weight (HMW) species at 3.7 and 4.3 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 and Namalwa cells to HBV resulted in HBs and pre-S1 antigen production in the supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, HMW HBV DNA forms were detected in both cell lines, but with distinct HindIII restriction patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that TNF alpha gene expression may be differently regulated by HBV in activated human macrophages and B cells, and thus TNF alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV </plain></SENT>
