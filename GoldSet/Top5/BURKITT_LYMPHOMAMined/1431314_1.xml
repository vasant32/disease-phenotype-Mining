<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of action of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), the effect on cell proliferation and protein synthesis in the human hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> line JOK-1 and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Daudi were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While Daudi cells were inhibited in proliferation and in total protein synthesis, no effect was seen on JOK-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that four <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were induced in JOK-1 cells after IFN-alpha incubation, while an additional 11 were induced and two down-regulated in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies revealed that the changes in JOK-1 cells were only temporary (within 8-16 h) and small to moderate in magnitude (less than four-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Daudi cells, the changes for two of these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were early (within 2 h), for most of them prolonged (at least 24 h), and for three of them of great magnitude (between 6- and 30-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analytical assessments indicated that four IFN-alpha-inducible <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi>, present in low amounts of untreated cells, were highly expressed only in sensitive Daudi cells upon IFN-alpha treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation might indicate a role for these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> in the inhibition of cell proliferation in Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, six of the other IFN-alpha-modulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were synthesized constitutively in JOK-1 cells at levels comparable to those achieved in IFN-alpha-treated Daudi cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
