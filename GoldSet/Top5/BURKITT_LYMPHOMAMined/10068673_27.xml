<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective expression of Btk leads to human and murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the exact role of Btk in the cytoplasmic signal transduction in B cells is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study represents a search for the substrate for Btk in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified one of the major phosphoproteins associated with Btk in the preB cell line NALM6 as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> protein (WASP), the gene product responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e>, which is another hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> with distinct abnormalities in hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that WASP was transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated after B-cell antigen receptor cross-linking on B cells, suggesting that WASP is located downstream of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An in vivo reconstitution system demonstrated that WASP is physically associated with Btk and can serve as the substrate for Btk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A protein binding assay suggested that the tyrosine-phosphorylation of WASP alters the association between WASP and a cellular protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, identification of the phosphorylation site of WASP in reconstituted cells allowed us to evaluate the catalytic specificity of Btk, the exact nature of which is still unknown </plain></SENT>
