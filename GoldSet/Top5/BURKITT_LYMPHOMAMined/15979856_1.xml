<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cell line expresses constitutively active nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the nucleus in spite of high levels of inhibitor kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative response of these cells to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) correlated with the inhibition of the constitutive NF-kappaB activity by the cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that IFN-alpha caused an increase in p53 level, inhibited cell proliferation by [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation, and stimulated cytotoxicity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by PARP-cleavage in the Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to study the relationship between the constitutively active NF-kappaB and IkappaB-alpha, a dominant negative mutant IkappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alphaDN), lacking the N-terminal 36 amino acids required for the activation of NF-kappaB by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), was expressed in the Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of IkappaB-alphaDN protein did not inhibit the constitutive NF-kappaB activity, but it inhibited cell proliferation, antiproliferative response to IFN-alpha, and phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase (p-MAPK) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Daudi cells is maintained by a mechanism independent of IkappaB-alpha degradation, and that the IkappaB-alpha is involved in the proliferation of these cells, possibly through the MAP kinase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in addition to IFN-alpha treatment, both NF-kappaB and IkappaB-alpha may be used as drug targets for inhibiting cell proliferation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
