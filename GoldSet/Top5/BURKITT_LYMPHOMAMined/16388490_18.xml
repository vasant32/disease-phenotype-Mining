<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured levels of EBV DNA in saliva and buffy coats from 233 asymptomatic Ugandan children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> and their mothers by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected in saliva from 90% of the children (median [interquartile range [IQR]] level, 5.2 [4.2-6.0] log(10) copies/mL of saliva) and 79% of the mothers (median [IQR] level, 4.8 [3.7-5.6] log(10) copies/mL of saliva) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected in buffy coats from 86% of the children (median [IQR] level, 2.5 [2.2-2.9] log(10) copies/1 x 10(6) peripheral white blood cells [PWBCs]) and 72% of the mothers (median [IQR] level, 2.7 [2.4-3.1] log(10) copies/1 x 10(6) PWBCs) (P = .24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection of EBV DNA in saliva was positively correlated with detection in buffy coats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was detected more frequently in saliva and buffy coats than was human herpesvirus 8 DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> persists, with virus readily detectable in saliva and buffy coats from persons without apparent symptoms in Africa </plain></SENT>
