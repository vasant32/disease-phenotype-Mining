<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the influence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> on the interaction of human NK cells with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells such as the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji and the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line A2058 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereby we found that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> inhibits the release of perforin and cytotoxic activity of NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of signal transduction showed that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> induces common signaling pathways of chemotaxins such as G(i) protein-dependent actin re-organization, activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase p38 as well as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent signal molecules [protein kinase B/Akt and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to most chemotaxins, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> is also able to activate G(s)-dependent signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This signaling cascade involves the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> receptor type-2, increase cAMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which in turn are responsible for the modulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> on NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, blocking the regulatory subunits of PKA I abrogates the inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi>, whereas the catalytic subunits are not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, one can assume that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> contributes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> escape from the immunological surveillance machinery </plain></SENT>
