<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that c-MYC-induced centrosome and centriole overduplication critically depend on the protease tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that TPPII localizes to centrosomes and that overexpression of TPPII, similar to c-MYC, can disrupt centriole duplication control and cause centriole multiplication, a process during which maternal centrioles nucleate the formation of more than a single daughter centriole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report that inactivation of TPPII using chemical inhibitors or siRNA-mediated protein knockdown effectively reduced c-MYC-induced centriole overduplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the potent and selective TPPII inhibitor butabindide not only potently suppressed centriole aberrations but also caused significant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and growth suppression in aggressive human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells with c-MYC overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results highlight the role of TPPII in c-MYC-induced centriole overduplication and encourage further studies to explore TPPII as a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic drug</z:chebi> target </plain></SENT>
