<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD44 has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> side chains and are able to bind <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> side chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results identify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24500">heparan</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>-modified CD44 (CD44-HS) as a functional co-receptor for HGF/SF which promotes signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, presumably by concentrating and presenting HGF/SF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
