<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have characterized a variant Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in which translocation joins the immunoglobulin kappa locus on chromosome 2 to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is especially interesting because, in contrast to the more common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that carry 8;14 translocations, it carries a translocation that involves a light chain locus and occurs 3' to and at least 20 kb downstream of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the c-myc gene from the translocated chromosome is abnormally expressed in that there is a characteristic shift in c-myc promoter utilization and an increase in c-myc transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disturbances could be explained by novel structural alterations that occur in the c-myc gene and include a duplication of a 2.5 kb segment of DNA containing the two c-myc promoters and their untranslated leader exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these alterations arise at a considerable distance from the translocation breakpoint </plain></SENT>
