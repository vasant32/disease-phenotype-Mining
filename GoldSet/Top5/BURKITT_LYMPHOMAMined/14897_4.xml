<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The soluble ISRD antigen retained activity even after exposure to a temperature of 80 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigen was precipitated in 40% saturated <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> and ISRD activity was recovered from the precipitate when reconstituted into a solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing and crossed immunoelectrophoretic analyses revealed that the esoelectric point of the ISRD antigen is pH 4.8 with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of serum alpha-globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With Sephadex G-200 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> 6B gel filtration, ISRD activity was obtained as a single peak which corresponded to the activity absorbing anti-complement immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of the present EBV-related soluble antigen was estimated to be 220,000-2408000 daltons </plain></SENT>
