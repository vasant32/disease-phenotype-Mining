<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BL67 cells express IgH/c-myc hybrid <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> which are initiated in the immunoglobulin locus, transcribed across the chromosomal breakpoint into the first exon of c-myc and spliced using the physiological splice donor and acceptor sites of the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have isolated cDNAs of these hybrid <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> and characterized the start points in the Ig heavy-chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two promoters were identified in the mu-switch region of BL67 cells which give rise to antisense transcription of the mu-gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These promoters are also active in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines, in B cells without Ig translocation and in a T-cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both promoters co-localize with DNAase I-hypersensitive sites, HNF and HSW, in the mu-switch region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The structures of IgH/c-myc hybrid <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> and of the corresponding promoters are described </plain></SENT>
