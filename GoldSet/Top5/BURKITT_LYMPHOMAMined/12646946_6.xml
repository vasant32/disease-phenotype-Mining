<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional therapies are urgently required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that combined fibrates and MPA exert powerful, antiproliferative actions against well-characterised Daudi, Raji and L3055 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies in L3055 demonstrated that this activity was mediated by induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and confirmed by observations that overexpression of the antiapoptotic genes bcl-2 or bcl-x(L) conferred significant protection against the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, since fibrates and MPA are inexpensive and stable with minimal-associated toxicities, we suggest that these drugs should be considered as adjuncts to currently available treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> in endemic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related disease </plain></SENT>
