<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From November 1987 to April 1989, a total of 32 patients with NHL were recruited; 6 were infants with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 26 were adults with NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was matched with 2 asymptomatic controls for age, sex and ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HTLV-I serology was done by ELISA and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the groups was done by chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 6 infants with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and none of their controls had antibodies to HTLV-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 26 patients with NHL, 7 (26.9%) had HTLV-I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 52 controls, the HTLV-I rate was 13.4% (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between cases and controls (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 26 NHL, 4 cases fitted the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e> and were HTLV-I-positive; 3 others who were positive for HTLV-I were a woman with lymphoblastic gastric NHL and 2 old men with an unclassified <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the results of this limited series it is not possible to state that there is an association between NHL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HTLV-I infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e> related to HTLV-I are reported from this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the HTLV-I seroprevalence rates reported in Gabon, the estimated incidence rate of ATL among seropositive people in Gabon appears much lower than in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Different explanations can be proposed, but under-diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ATLL</z:e> is probably one of the main factors </plain></SENT>
