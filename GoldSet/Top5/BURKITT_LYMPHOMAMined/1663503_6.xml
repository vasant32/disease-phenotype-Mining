<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We synthesized the fluorescent derivative, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45127">phorbol-13-acetate</z:chebi>-12-N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-N-4-(N,N'-di(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44730">2-hydroxyethyl</z:chebi>)amino)-7-n itr obenz-2-oxa-1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23677">diazole</z:chebi>-aminododecanoate (N-C12-Ac(13)) of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) to monitor the location of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> binding sites and evaluate its potential use as a probe of PKC in viable cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The excitation maximum wavelength of N-C12-Ac(13) is close to 488 nm, facilitating its use in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-ion laser flow and imaging cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When incubated with 100 nM N-C12-Ac(13) at 25 degrees C, P3HR-1 Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells accumulated the dye rapidly, reaching maximum fluorescence within 25 min, 20-fold above autofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Addition of unlabeled <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> significantly decreased the fluorescence of N-C12-Ac(13) stained cells in a dose-dependent manner indicating specific displacement of the bound fluoroprobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Competitive displacement of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> ([3H]-PBu2) from rat brain cytosol with N-C12-Ac(13) gave an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 11 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>N-C12-Ac(13) possessed biological activity similar to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Like <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> (final concentration 65 nM) N-C12-Ac(13), at a lower concentration (51 nM), induced expression of Epstein-Barr <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in P3HR-1 cells, differentiation of promyelocytic HL60 cells, and caused predicted changes in the mitotic cycle of histiocytic DD cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microspectrofluorometric images of single cells labeled with N-C12-Ac(13) showed bright fluorescence localized intracellularly and dim fluorescence in the nuclear region, consistent with dye binding mainly to cytoplasmic structures and/or organelles and being mostly excluded from the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the high level of non-specific binding of N-C12-Ac(13), this probe is not ideal for visualizing PKC in intact cells, but would be a valuable fluoroprobe to investigate the kinetic properties of purified PKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, knowledge gained from these studies allows us to predict structures of fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbols</z:chebi> likely to have less non-specific binding and, consequently, be potentially useful for monitoring PKC in viable cells </plain></SENT>
