<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By inserting a c-myc gene under the control of the 3'IgH locus control region (LCR) into the mouse genome, we generated c-myc-3'LCR mice that develop clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> or diffuse anaplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show in the present study that while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from c-myc-3'LCR mice would be classified as pre-germinal center (GC) cells due to the absence of both BCL-6 expression and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in V(H) sequences, they show a high level of SHM focused on the c-myc oncogene itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the c-myc-3'IgH LCR tandem association drives development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> from na√Øve B cells by specifically recruiting AID activity on c-myc in a process that early becomes independent from antigen selection and where the successive rounds of SHM rather rely on the selection of the most efficient mutations for oncogene deregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar to the translocated c-myc gene in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, mutations were found in first exon and 5' flanking sequences of transgenic c-myc and specially focused on negative regulatory elements, thus leading to high and constitutive oncogene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion while 3'IgH transcriptional enhancers in c-myc-3'LCR mice first simply act in cis to slightly stimulate c-myc transcription in untransformed B cells, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> appears to result from an additional mechanism necessitating AID-driven mutations within the first exon and 5' flanking sequences which does not occur in parallel but rather circumvents antigen-driven selection </plain></SENT>
