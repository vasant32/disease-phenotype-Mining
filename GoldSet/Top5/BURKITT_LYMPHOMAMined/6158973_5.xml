<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as well as neoplastic B-cell lines vary substantially in their response to the antiproliferative effects of human interferon (HIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we took advantage of a recent method to generate long-term continuous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell cultures (CTC) to investigate the effects of HIF on proliferating lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> CTC proved to be resistant to inhibition of proliferation; up to 1000 u HIF had little effect on [3H] TdR uptake, and up to 2000 u HIF had little effect on cell-cycle progression, measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells were also resistant to the antiproliferative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nor did up to 500 m HIF inhibit <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis or immunoglobulin biosynthesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a neoplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> B cell, a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell and a neoplastic leukaemic T cell showed marked inhibition of [3H] TdR uptake and cell cycle progression with as little as 5 u HIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that amounts of HIF sufficient to inhibit proliferation of some neoplastic lymphoid cells have little effect on T- and B-cell proliferation and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
