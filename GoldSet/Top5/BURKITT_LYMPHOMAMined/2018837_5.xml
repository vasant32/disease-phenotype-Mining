<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proliferation of leukemic cells from the bone marrow of 11 of 13 patients (seven at diagnosis, four in relapse) and from the 697 (BCP-ALL) cell line was significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha at the lowest dose tested (0.1 ng/mL), as measured by 3H-TdR uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of inhibition was variable, ranging from 17% to 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed, with approximately 70% mean inhibition of DNA synthesis detected when cells from 12 of 13 patients were incubated with 100 ng/mL of rTNF-alpha for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rTNF-alpha did not inhibit another BCP-ALL cell line (EU-1/ALL) established recently in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies indicated that the TNF-alpha gene was expressed by the primary leukemic blasts of one TNF-resistant case in his third relapse and by EU-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, TNF-alpha protein was detected by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in the supernatant of EU-1 cells; this is the first report of TNF production by a BCP-ALL cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The production of TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was not detected in the 697 cell line and in the primary leukemic blasts from six patients (four at diagnosis, two in relapse) whose leukemic cells were inhibited by TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The partially purified TNF-alpha obtained from the EU-1 cell line also suppressed the proliferation of TNF-sensitive primary leukemic cells, and this inhibitory activity was abolished by an anti-TNF-alpha specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that TNF-alpha is an inhibitor of in vitro proliferation of BCP-ALL cells from most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TNF-resistant leukemic cells from a few patients and the EU-1 cell line express TNF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, suggesting that the induction of TNF gene expression is associated with the development of TNF resistance </plain></SENT>
