<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strain 594S-F9 of HVP, unlike strain P3HR-1 of EBV, is not capable of inducing virus antigen synthesis in the EBV genome-carrying, nonproducer <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With untreated viruses, the percentage of cells positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> antigens was equal to or slightly less than that in cultures infected with P3HR-1 virus only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, if UV-irradiated P3HR-1 virus was employed in the dual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the relative number of virus antigen-positive cells was enhanced over cultures infected with P3HR-1 virus alone </plain></SENT>
