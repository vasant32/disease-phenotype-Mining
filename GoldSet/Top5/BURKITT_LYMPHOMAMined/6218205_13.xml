<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made between the binding sites of two receptors that are believed to be closely associated on human B lymphocytes: complement receptor type two (CR2) that is specific for C3d fragments, and the receptor (EBVR) for Epstein Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Isolated fluid-phase CR2 bound to C3d on erythrocytes (EC3d) and inhibited both B cell-EC3d rosettes and the agglutination of EC3d by anti-C3d, it failed to inhibit either the binding or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> of B cells by EBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, isolated fluid-phase EBVR inhibited EBV B cell binding activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038826" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superinfection</z:e> but had no CR2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, radiolabeled CR2 bound to EC3d and anti-CR2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, whereas radiolabeled EBVR did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Purified fluid-phase C3d fragments inhibited EC3d rosette formation with CR2+/EBVR+ cells but did not inhibit EBV binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, EBV binding to B cells did inhibit EC3d rosette formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clones of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids made from CR2+/EBVR+ human B lymphoblastoid cell and CR2-/EBVR- mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell parents expressed either EBVR or CR2 but only rarely expressed both EBVR and CR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the genes for EBVR and CR2 were located on two different human chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus it was concluded that CR2 is probably not the binding site for EBV </plain></SENT>
