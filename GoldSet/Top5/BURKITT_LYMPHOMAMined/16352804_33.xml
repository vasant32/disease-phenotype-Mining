<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While adoptive transfer of donor-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific T cells is a conceptually attractive approach to eliminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, adoptive immunotherapy after UCBT is constrained by the difficulty of generating antigen-specific T cells from functionally naive umbilical cord-blood (UCB)-derived T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to generate T cells that recognize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e>, we have developed a chimeric immunoreceptor to redirect the specificity of T cells for CD19, a B-lineage antigen, and expressed this transgene in UCB-derived T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ex vivo process, which is compliant with current good manufacturing practice for T-cell trials, has been developed to genetically modify and numerically expand UCB-derived T cells into CD19-specific effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These are capable of CD19-restricted cytokine production and cytolysis in vitro, as well as mediating regression of CD19+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and being selectively eliminated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, time-lapse microscopy of the genetically modified T-cell clones revealed an ability to lyse CD19+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells specifically and repetitively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide the rationale for infusing UCB-derived CD19-specific T cells after UCBT to reduce the incidence of CD19+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> relapse </plain></SENT>
