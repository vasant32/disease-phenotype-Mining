<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new liquid cell culture assay for propagating Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cells in the presence of excess allogeneic irradiated bone marrow (BM) has been standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Burkitt cell lines used in this assay were newly established from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> of our patients and were either EBV(+) or EBV(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic characteristics of lines were similar to those of the original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the help of this liquid assay it was possible to evaluate the efficacy of in vitro procedures designed to completely eliminate malignant cells from harvested BM prior to autologous transplantation (i.e., immunomagnetic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or antibody-complement-mediated cytolysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With six out of the seven cell lines tested, the assay permitted the detection of as few as one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell in 4 X 10(6) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells and the measurement of up to 5 log <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell elimination from 1% contaminated samples </plain></SENT>
