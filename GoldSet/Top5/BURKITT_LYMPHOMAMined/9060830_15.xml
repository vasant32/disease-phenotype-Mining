<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified the integrin alpha 4 beta 7 as a mucosal homing receptor that mediates lymphocyte migration to the intestinal mucosa by binding to MAdCAM-1, a vascular recognition molecule (addressin) selectively expressed on mucosal endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have assessed the expression of alpha 4 beta 7 on B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> of different primary localization and on related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was present in the majority of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334638" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant lymphomatous polyposis</z:e> of the intestine and low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue/monocytoid B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and in some cases of precursor B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLL/small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, (nodal) mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, follicular center cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were virtually always alpha 4 beta 7 negative, as was the case when localized in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells of the follicle mantles and part of the B cells of the extrafollicular B-cell compartment of lymphoid tissues expressed moderate levels of alpha 4 beta 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, follicular center cells were alpha 4 beta 7 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among T-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was also strongly related to the primary localization; in mucosal, nodal, and cutaneous T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> the percentage of positive cases was 56%, 17%, and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of precursor T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were alpha 4 beta 7 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High expression of alpha 4 beta 7 was found on a subset of peripheral blood memory T cells as well as on lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> that are related to mucosa-associated B- and T-lymphocyte populations selectively express the mucosal homing receptor alpha 4 beta 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of this receptor underscores their distinctive character and may play an important role in determining their characteristic mucosal dissemination pattern </plain></SENT>
