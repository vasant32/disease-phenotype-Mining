<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, abnormalities involving the c-myc gene are essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CT-element of the c-myc promoter adopts non-B-conformation in vivo and in vitro, and therefore provides a potential fragile site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have developed a LM-PCR-based approach to test if chromosomal breakpoints indeed cluster in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amplifying both, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> as well as the translocated c-myc gene by LM-PCR, it was shown that chromosomal breakpoints did not cluster within the CT-element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the CT-element is not especially susceptible to the formation of breakpoints leading to chromosomal translocations in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
