<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An in situ polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) technique was used to detect and differentiate strains of episomal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IS-PCR was performed on cell monolayers in eight-chamber glass slides using EBV type-specific primer pairs conserved within the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA) 3C region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amplicons in the cells were detected by in situ hybridization using EBV type-1 and type-2 specific 5'-biotinylated oligonucleotide probes and avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase as secondary reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method was successfully used to identify EBV strains not only in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines but also in B cells obtained from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technique described on this report is a reliable method to detect latently infected EBV-positive cells and can potentially be used to identify and type EBV strains present in clinical specimens </plain></SENT>
