<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MP (LDMTX/IVMP) for prevention of relapse in children with lower-risk B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred nine patients were entered onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">Vincristine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and asparaginase were used for remission induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive intensification with either IVMTX 1,000 mg/m2 plus IVMP 1,000 mg/m2 (regimen A) or LDMTX 30 mg/m2 every 6 hours for six doses with IVMP 1,000 mg/m2 (regimen B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve courses were administered at 2-week intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) was used for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuation therapy included standard oral MP, weekly MTX, and TIT every 12 weeks for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-nine (99%) patients achieved remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three hundred forty-nine were assigned to regimen A and 350 to regimen B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The estimated 4-year continuous complete remission (CCR) rate for patients treated with regimen A is 80.3% (SE = 2.9%) and with regimen B is 75.9% (SE = 3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By log-rank analysis, regimen A demonstrated superior CCR (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, neurotoxicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, and hospitalizations were more frequent among patients treated on regimen A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intensification with IVMTX/IVMP is more effective than LDMTX/IVMP for prevention of relapse in children with B-precursor ALL at lower risk for relapse </plain></SENT>
