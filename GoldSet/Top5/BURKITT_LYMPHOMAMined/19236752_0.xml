<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A siRNA was designed and synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then siRNA was transfected into CA46 cells by cationic liposome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours after transfection, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and mitochondria transmembrane potential of CA46 cells were detected by flow cytometry, the expression of bcl-2 mRNA and BCL-2 protein in CA46 cells were detected by RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that at 48 hours after transfection, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CA46 cells occurred, mitochondria transmembrane potential changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of bcl-2 mRNA and BCL-2 protein in CA46 cells decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, bcl-2 siRNA depresses the expression of bcl-2 gene in CA46 cells specifically, then changes the mitochondria transmembrane potential, resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
