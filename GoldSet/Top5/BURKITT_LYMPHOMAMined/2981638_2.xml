<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-induced B-cell proliferation was suppressed almost completely when 10(2) U/ml IFN-alpha were added to the culture medium while the same dose of IFN-gamma had significantly lower inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pure IFNs differed in their ability to influence the growth of three Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell lines, Raji, Daudi, and Namalwa, depending on whether the cells were propagated in suspension or in semisolid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha inhibited cell proliferation under both culture conditions with thresholds of sensitivity characteristics for each cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IFN-gamma had no effect on the growth in suspension but it abolished the clonogenic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines in semisolid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the two IFN types may exert their growth inhibitory activity through different mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
