<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several hundred kb of specific transcripts is sharply restricted to a small region of the nucleus, frequently in a curvilinear "track" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detection of nuclear <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was evidenced by hybridization without denaturation, sensitivity to RNAase, inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, and specificity of transcribed sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> "tracks" extend from an internal genome into the nuclear periphery, and that <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transport may be coupled to transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Localized nRNA is apparent for other <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> sequences, different lymphoblastoid cell lines, nuclei prepared by two different methods, and an abundant, nonviral transfected sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Implications for understanding nuclear organization and the investigation of gene expression are discussed </plain></SENT>
