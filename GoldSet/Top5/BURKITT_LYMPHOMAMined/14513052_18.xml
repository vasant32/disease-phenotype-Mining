<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the information on the genomic imbalances in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) is scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetics was performed in 34 cases, and long-distance PCR for t(8;14) was performed in 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 170 changes were present with a median of four changes per case (range 1-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gains of chromosomal material (143) were more frequent than amplifications (5) or losses (22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent aberrations were gains on chromosomes 12q (26%), Xq (22%), 22q (20%), 20q (17%) and 9q (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Losses predominantly involved chromosomes 13q (17%) and 4q (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-level amplifications were present in the regions 1q23-31 (three cases), 6p12-p25 and 8p22-p23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> vs Burkitt's cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (BCL), the latter had more changes (mean 4.3 +/- 2.2) than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> (mean 2.7 +/- 3.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, BCL cases showed more frequently gains on 8q, 9q, 14q, 20q, and 20q, 9q, 8q and 14q, as well as losses on 13q and 4q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concerning outcome, the presence of abnormalities on 1q (ascertained either by cytogenetics or by CGH), and imbalances on 7q (P=0.01) were associated with a short survival </plain></SENT>
