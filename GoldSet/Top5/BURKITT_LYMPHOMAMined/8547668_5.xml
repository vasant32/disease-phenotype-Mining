<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the potential of a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) nonrestricted killer T-cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104) as a new marrow purging agent in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cells can be irradiated without losing cytotoxic activity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targets in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the irradiated killers can be adoptively transferred into immunodeficient and immunocompetent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-bearing mice, and reverse their disease even in advanced stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that gamma-irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cells, cultured for 18 hours with marrows from healthy donors, do not impair the viability and long-term growth of committed and pluripotent hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and colony assays, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cells could completely purge marrows containing up to 50% lysis-susceptible myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells (U937) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When marrows were admixed with a pre-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (ALL-1), which is fairly resistant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cell lysis in longterm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-release assays but can be totally growth inhibited by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cells in proliferation assays, residual ALL-1 cells were detectable by PCR after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 purging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, importantly, these PCR+ marrows were devoid of tumorigenic activity when transplanted into the human hematopoietic microenvironment of human severe combined immunodeficient (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate the strong potential of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TALL</z:e>-104 cell line in future marrow purging strategies against lysis-susceptible and -resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
