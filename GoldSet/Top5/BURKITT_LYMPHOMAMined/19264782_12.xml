<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency III program imposed by EBNA2 and LMP1 is directly responsible for immortalization of B cells in vitro and is thought to mediate most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo>-related posttransplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative diseases</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To answer the question whether and how this proliferation program is related to c-Myc, we have established the transcriptome of both c-Myc and EBV latency III proliferation programs using a Lymphochip specialized microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to EBV-positive latency I Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we used an LCL expressing an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-regulatable EBNA2 fusion protein (EREB2-5) and derivative B-cell lines expressing a constitutively active or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-regulatable c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 897 genes were found to be fourfold or more up- or downregulated in either one or both proliferation programs compared to the expression profile of resting EREB2-5 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 661 (74%) of these were regulated similarly in both programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous repressed genes were known targets of STAT1, and most induced genes were known to be upregulated by c-Myc and to be involved in cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the gene expression patterns, inactivation of c-Myc by a chemical inhibitor or by conditional expression of dominant-negative c-Myc and Max mutants led to proliferation arrest of LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most genes differently regulated in both proliferation programs corresponded to genes induced by NF-kappaB in LCLs, and many of them coded for immunoregulatory and/or antiapoptotic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, c-Myc and NF-kappaB are the two main transcription factors responsible for the phenotype, growth pattern, and biological properties of cells driven into proliferation by EBV </plain></SENT>
