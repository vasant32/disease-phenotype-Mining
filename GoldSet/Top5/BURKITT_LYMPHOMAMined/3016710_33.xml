<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sets of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from the same individuals were compared for sensitivity to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-restricted CTL clones were generated by stimulating the lymphocytes of an EBV-seropositive individual with the autologous LCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One clone (BK-20) lysed the autologous and allogeneic HLA-A11-expressing LCLs but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-induced B lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the clone was selectively cytotoxic for LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allospecific CTL clones directed against the HLA-A11 antigen were generated from an EBV-seronegative individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One clone (WP-36) was selectively cytotoxic for the appropriate allospecific LCL, whereas another clone (WP-21) lysed also T and B lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the four Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines established in parallel with the CTL-sensitive LCLs were lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines were EBV-negative, and EBV-positive sublines were derived from these by in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One but not the other of the two convertants became sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of CTL clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CTL-sensitive converted line had also acquired some LCL characteristics: <z:mp ids='MP_0000354'>increased cell size</z:mp>, aggregation, and a shift in several of the B-cell-specific surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CTL-resistant convertant expressed EBV antigens but showed no phenotypic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> plays a decisive role in the sensitivity of B-cell-derived lines to the lytic effect of LCL-selective autologous and allogeneic CTLs </plain></SENT>
