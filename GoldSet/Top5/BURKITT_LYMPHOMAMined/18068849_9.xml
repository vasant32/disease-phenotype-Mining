<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of an ongoing effort to develop a clinically acceptable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> formulation, targeted against B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, this study compared long-circulating (Stealth) immunoliposomes (SIL) that were targeted against the B-cell antigen CD19, via a whole HD37 monoclonal antibody (HD37 mAb), versus its Fab' fragment (HD37 Fab') or an HD37-c-myc-Cys-His5 single chain Fv fragment (scFv, HD37-CCH) directed against the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to untargeted liposomes (SL), SIL showed increased binding in vitro to CD19-expressing Raji cells and, when loaded with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (SIL-DXR), increased cytotoxicity against Raji (CD19(+)), but not Molt4 (CD19(-)) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies using dual-labeled liposomes (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and drug) in naive and Raji-bearing mice showed that SIL-DXR targeted via HD37 Fab' exhibited the same long circulation half-life as SL-DXR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SIL-DXR targeted via HD37-CCH was cleared faster than SL-DXR due to increased liver uptake, which was related to the poly-His and/or the c-myc tags in the scFv construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SIL-DXR targeted via HD37 mAb was cleared rapidly from circulation due to Fc-mediated uptake in the liver and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three formulations of SIL-DXR extended the mean survival time of Raji-bearing mice compared to SL-DXR or free DXR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIL-DXR targeted via HD37 Fab', which had the longest circulation half-life, appeared to be slightly more effective in prolonging survival times than SIL-DXR targeted via either HD37-CCH or HD37 mAb </plain></SENT>
