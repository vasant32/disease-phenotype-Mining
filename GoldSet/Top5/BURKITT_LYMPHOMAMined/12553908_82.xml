<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>X-ray structures of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domains of Myc-Max and Mad-Max heterodimers bound to their common DNA target (Enhancer or E box hexanucleotide, 5'-CACGTG-3') have been determined at 1.9 A and 2.0 A resolution, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E box recognition by these two structurally similar transcription factor pairs determines whether a cell will divide and proliferate (Myc-Max) or differentiate and become quiescent (Mad-Max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of Myc has been implicated in the development of many human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastomas</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both quasisymmetric heterodimers resemble the symmetric Max homodimer, albeit with marked structural differences in the coiled-coil leucine zipper regions that explain preferential homo- and heteromeric dimerization of these three evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Myc-Max heterodimer, but not its Mad-Max counterpart, dimerizes to form a bivalent heterotetramer, which explains how Myc can upregulate expression of genes with promoters bearing widely separated E boxes </plain></SENT>
