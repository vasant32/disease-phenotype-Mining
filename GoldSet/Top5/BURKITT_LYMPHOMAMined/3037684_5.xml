<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, 25 out of 29 EBV-positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines but none of 15 EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines were found to express C3 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV of six EBV-negative cell lines resulted in the expression of C3 receptors in association with that of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rosette assays using erythrocytes coated with human C3b, C3bi, and C3d, inhibition of rosette formation with anti-receptor antibodies, and flow cytometry analysis of stained cells demonstrated that EBV-converted lines expressed C3b and C3d receptors, CR1 and CR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-receptor antibodies recognized an average of 40,700 anti-CR1 and 140,000 anti-CR2 binding sites on an EBV-converted line (BL41/B95), whereas no specific binding occurred on the corresponding EBV-negative (BL41) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because CR1 and CR2 are involved in B-cell proliferation and/or differentiation, enhanced expression of C3 receptors following the interaction between EBV and B cells and/or subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the cells by EBV may provide a basis for positive control of B lymphocyte proliferation by EBV </plain></SENT>
