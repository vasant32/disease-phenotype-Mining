<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surveillance for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1701919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV viremia</z:e> using serial EBV polymerase chain reaction determinations in the peripheral blood was positive at 10 and 90 days after OLT concomitant with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e>, both patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="465284">gancyclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
