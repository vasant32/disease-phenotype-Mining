<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The c-fos proto-oncogene is found to be overexpressed at least 30-fold in SMS-SB, a pre-B leukemic cell line compared to other cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No gross alteration of the c-fos gene structure in SMS-SB cells can be detected by karyotypic or Southern analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-fos in SMS-SB cells can still be induced by serum, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>, A23187, and superinduced by the combination of serum and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevated levels of c-fos transcripts are not due merely to an increased life span of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, as the half-life of steady state c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in SMS-SB cells is about 40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrate that the transcription rate of c-fos in SMS-SB cells is up-regulated about 30-fold as compared to another pre-B leukemic cell line, NALM-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether this is a cis- or transacting effect, we sequenced the 550 base pairs upstream of the SMS-SB c-fos coding region and found no mutations upstream of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> CAP site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, two point mutations at positions +23 and +98, respectively, were found in the 5' noncoding region of the first exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the overexpression of c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, the 55 kD c-fos protein is present in SMS-SB cells through detection by immunoprecipitation, but could not be detected in NALM-6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SMS-SB cells however, do not appear to contain more abundant AP-1 DNA binding activity than NALM-6 cells </plain></SENT>
