<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms mediating B-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> by rituximab are not completely understood and may include direct effects of signalling via the target antigen CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like most but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD20 mAbs, rituximab induces a sharp change in the solubility of the CD20 protein in the non-ionic detergent <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi>-X-100, reflecting a dramatic increase in the innate affinity of CD20 for membrane raft signalling domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by rituximab hypercrosslinking has been shown to require src family kinases (SFK), which are enriched in rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report we provide experimental evidence that SFK-dependent apoptotic signals induced by rituximab are raft dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> prevented the association of hypercrosslinked CD20 with detergent-insoluble rafts, and attenuated both calcium mobilization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD20 cocapped with the raft-associated transmembrane adaptor LAB/NTAL after hypercrosslinking with CD20 mAbs, regardless of their ability to induce a change in the affinity of CD20 for rafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the data demonstrate that CD20 hypercrosslinking via rituximab activates SFKs and downstream signalling events by clustering membrane rafts in which antibody-bound CD20 is localized in a high-affinity configuration </plain></SENT>
