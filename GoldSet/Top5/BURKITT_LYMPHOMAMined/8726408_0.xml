<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of ALLs were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ALLs from group I (21 patients) exhibited a low spontaneous proliferative rate and were stimulated by IL-3 + IL-7 +/- SCF and/or LIF, while ALLs from group II (6 patients) had a high spontaneous proliferative rate and did no longer require this combination of GFs for proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No effect of bFGF, IGF-I, IL-10 and IL-11 alone or in combination, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such differences in the behaviour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALLs</z:e> indicated that the GF requirement of ALL blasts was not related to the presence of serum in the culture nor to the pattern of reactivity of ALL blasts for B lymphoid markers or CD34 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed in 1/9 cases that high proliferation might be due to an overexpression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene and to the acquisition of an autocrine secretion </plain></SENT>
