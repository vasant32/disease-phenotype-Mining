<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of the HLA-DR antigens was studied in the B lymphoblastoid cell line BRI 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three chains, of molecular weights 33,000 (alpha), 31,000 (p31), and 26,000 (beta) were detected intracellularly in pulse-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-(HLA-DR) sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alpha and beta chains were inserted asymmetrically into the rough endoplasmic reticulum as transmembrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with the majority of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chains</z:chebi> oriented in the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At this stage, both chains carried "high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>" <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> units which were processed to the complex form during subsequent intracellular transport to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mr = 31,000 polypeptide was also glycosylated but was structurally distinct from the alpha chain and was probably oriented differently in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer, with a much greater proportion of its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16541">polypeptide chain</z:chebi> exposed in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It ws not, therefore, a precursor of the alpha chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mature HLA-DR antigens at the plasma membrane comprised <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> of Mr = 34,000 and 28,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These chains corresponded to the processed alpha and beta chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the Mr = 31,000 component was only detected intracellularly, it was not ruled out that some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of it may have been processed and exposed on the cell surface with an apparent molecular weight indistinguishable from that of the alpha chain </plain></SENT>
