<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the clinical presentation, morphologic features, immunophenotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> status of sBL in Guangzhou district, a prevalent area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: The clinical data of 21 sBL patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A panel of immunohistochemical staining was performed and EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (EBERs) in situ hybridization was applied to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: From January 2000 to October 2007, 21 cases(0.87%) of sBL were confirmed among 2416 cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>(NHL) in Sun Yat-sen University <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 4.25 (17/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 23 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients, 19 (90.48%) had lymph node(s) involvement; 16 (76.19%) had multiple sites involvement; 12 (57.14%) were at advanced stages (III/IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year survival rate of 15 patients who received chemotherapy or resection plus chemotherapy was 56.00% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty cases showed the prototypic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of sBL, and one was the variant of sBL with plasmacytoid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main immunophenotype of these 21 sBLs was sIgM+/CD20+/CD10+/Bcl-6+/Bcl-2-[or Bcl-6+(&gt;95%)/Bcl-2+(&lt;10%)]/TdT-/Ki-67+ 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 20 detectable cases, 11 showed CD5 expression in a few (3%-20%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>P53 was overexpressed in ten cases (47.62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six cases (28.57%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, with EBNA1 and EBERs expression, but not LMP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype between EBV-positive and EBV-negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: sBL is uncommon in Guangzhou district, mainly seen in boys and young men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most patients had lymph node(s) involvement, showing similar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotype as that of endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Type I EBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0872054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">latent infection</z:e> is associated with 28.57% of cases </plain></SENT>
