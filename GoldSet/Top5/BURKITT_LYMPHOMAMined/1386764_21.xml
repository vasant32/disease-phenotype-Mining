<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this procedure, we demonstrated that the p34 CDC2 kinase was activated at the start of S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A synthesis began at the same time, and activation of the p34 CDC2 kinase at the start of S phase was, at least in part, due to its association with cyclin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cells synchronized in late G1 by exposure to the drug mimosine contain active cyclin A/p34 CDC2 kinase, indicating that p34 CDC2 activation can occur before DNA synthesis begins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cyclin A/CDC2 complex, which previously has been shown to be sufficient to start SV40 DNA synthesis in vitro, assembles and is activated at the start of S phase in vivo </plain></SENT>
