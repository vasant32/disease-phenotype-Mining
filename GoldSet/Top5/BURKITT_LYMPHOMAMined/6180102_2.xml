<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells growth arrested at high density and diluted into fresh medium, were growth inhibited at the same time and to the same degree as exponentially growing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, resting cells did not seem to be more sensitive to IFN than exponentially growing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cells displayed the same sensitivity to IFN during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell cycle phases and they were found to enter the G0 stage in a dose dependent manner following first order kinetics </plain></SENT>
