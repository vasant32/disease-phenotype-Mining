<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic features of 44 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) were investigated by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases were positive for HLA-DR (97 per cent), CD19 (100 per cent), CD20 (92 per cent) and CD37 (83 per cent) pan-B markers, in accordance with the B-cell derivation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>; the B-cell restricted markers CD21, CD22 and FMC7 reacted with 28 per cent, 66 per cent and 75 per cent of cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the mantle zone B-cell specific MoAbs, CD1c was always negative, whereas CD23 and 2.7 were positive with one and two cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD39 was weakly reactive on two specimens, one of which was CD23+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The germinal centre specific MoAbs CD10 and CD77 (Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> antigen) displayed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pattern of reactivity and allowed to identify 4 subgroups: CD10+/CD77+ (44 per cent), CD10+/CD77- (15 per cent), CD10-/CD77+ (36 per cent) and CD10-/CD77- (5 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 15 cases tested for the expression of CD11a and CD18 lymphocyte-function-associated (LFA-1) antigens and their ligand ICAM-1 (CD54), seven were positive and six negative for the three markers, while the other two cases expressed alternatively the two molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the putative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell counterpart, identified with the CD77 marker in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphoid tissues, showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CD77+ B-cells were constitutively CD11a+/CD18+, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> are likely to arise from a LFA-1 positive B-cell and may down-regulate these molecules during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007621" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
