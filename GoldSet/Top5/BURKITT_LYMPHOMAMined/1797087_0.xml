<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Namalva cell line, established from a Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, exhibits a highly variable female karyotype with a large number of marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Libraries from sorted human chromosomes 1 and 5 were used to delineate material of these chromosomes present in the Namalva karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the DAB/peroxidase reaction and reflection contrast microscopy for detection of biotinylated hybrid molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of chromosomes was achieved by fluorescent R-banding after CISS hybridization, which allowed the assignment of hybridized regions to the particular marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After CISS hybridization with a chromosome I library, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome I was labelled as well as a large marker MI and the long arm of marker M3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a chromosome 5 library it could be shown that the distal part of the long arm of one chromosome 5 was translocated to marker M2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 5 was completely labelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present investigation demonstrates the advantage of combining CISS hybridization and banding for the identification of complex, rearranged <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
