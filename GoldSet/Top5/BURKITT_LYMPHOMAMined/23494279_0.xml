<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> may represent a grey zone in the differentiation between indolent and aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Often they may show morphological features of one entity but be more related to another entity with respect to the immunophenotype and/or genetic constitution, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> in the grey zone between primary mediastinal large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and primary nodal diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
