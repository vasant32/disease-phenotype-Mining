<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>B cells have been shown to receive negative signals for their growth through crosslinking of surface IgM (sIgM), and it has been demonstrated that anti-IgM Abs induce B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of B cells in response to Ag stimulation in vivo may thus require additional signals that inhibit the sIgM-transduced negative signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signaling through CD40 has been proposed as a candidate for such costimulatory signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of CD40-transduced signals in sIgM-mediated B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we used a human B cell line (DND-39) that expresses sIgM, sIgD, and CD40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crosslinking of sIgM, but not sIgD, by Abs induced DND-39 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dying cells showed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD40 Abs induced homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of DND-39 cells and rescued them from anti-IgM Ab-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD40 Abs inhibited anti-IgM Ab-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when added within 3 h after stimulation with anti-IgM Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Abs against CD11a, CD18, or CD54 inhibited not only the homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> but also the inhibition of anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by anti-CD40 Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD11a antisense decreased the surface CD11a expression, the anti-CD40 Ab-induced homotypic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, and the inhibitory effect of anti-CD40 Ab on anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data show that LFA-1/ICAM-1-dependent cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> induced by signaling through CD40 plays an important role in the inhibition of anti-IgM Ab-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of DND-39 cells </plain></SENT>
