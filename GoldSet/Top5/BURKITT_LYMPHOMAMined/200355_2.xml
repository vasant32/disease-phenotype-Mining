<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two distinct cultures derived from a lymphoid cell line designated NAB were characterized immunologically, morphologically, and cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both cultures were positive for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NAB I cultures were negative for virus capsid antigen and early antigen and were not affected by treatment with 5-iododeoxyurdine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NAB II cultures were positive for virus capsid antigen and early antigen, which increased with 5-iododeoxyuridine treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cultures were superinfected with virus prepared from P3HR-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell-free virus concentrates prepared from both cultures were inactive for transformation and infectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NAB I and NAB II cells were lymphoid as determined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NAB II cells showed morphological alterations characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5-iododeoxyuridine-treated cells from both cultures revealed ultrastructural characteristics of cells infected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e>-viruses but without particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the induction of tubuloreticular structures within the endoplasmic reticulum was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of both cultures revealed a rearranged chromosome 14 and several other chromosome aberrations, three of which may be used as a reliable means of identifying NAB cultures </plain></SENT>
