<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, pregnancy and lactation complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> about two times per 100 female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the same period there were 51,058 deliveries, for a rate of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo> per 10,000 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When women in the most active reproductive age group (20-40 years) were considered, there were 309 cases of female <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 5% of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> in this age group had concurrent pregnancy or lactation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients presented late, and the prognosis was generally poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the clinical features of inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> are similar in most countries, the characteristics of some of the histologic types of breast <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> encountered in pregnancy and lactation in Nigerian women appear to differ from those reported in most European and American studies </plain></SENT>
