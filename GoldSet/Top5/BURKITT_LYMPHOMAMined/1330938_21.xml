<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is expressed in EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> origin and in the majority of the poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, but not in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LMP has been reported to transform rodent fibroblasts, to inhibit epithelial differentiation and to alter <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cytokeratin expression in an in vitro immortalized human keratinocyte cell-line, RHEK-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now report that an LMP-transfected mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp> line, SHG, exhibits a similar morphological change to that previously described in the LMP-transfected RHEK-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the LMP-transfected RHEK-I and SHG cells, we observed a decreased expression of the calcium-dependent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule E-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LMP-transfected RHEK-I cells were capable of invading type-I collagen gels while the control cells were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LMP-transfected SHG cells showed a significantly higher invasive capacity than the original cell line </plain></SENT>
