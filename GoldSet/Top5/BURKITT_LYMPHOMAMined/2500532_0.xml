<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None had rearrangement of the delta gene locus within the 9.0-kb BamHI restriction fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell lines that expressed the delta gene contained both mu alleles, with at least one productively rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 18 cell lines had detectable transcripts hybridizing with the delta probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 10 of the 13 cell lines with delta transcripts, cytoplasmic delta chains were detected, but only two of these expressed delta chains strongly on the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 lines made cytoplasmic mu chains, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one made cytoplasmic light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surface IgM was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except two of the 13 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> has generally been considered not to express IgD, except in occasional cases, previous studies have been confined to examination of the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many of the cell lines that we examined express delta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts as well as produce cytoplasmic delta chains but no detectable surface IgD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that delta chains are detectable in the cytoplasm prior to being apparent on the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings argue against an origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from germinal center cells since IgD is almost totally lacking in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells present in germinal centers </plain></SENT>
