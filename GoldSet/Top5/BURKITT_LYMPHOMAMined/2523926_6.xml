<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, visualization of gold particles was enhanced by the silver enhancement technique and by backscattered electron imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding studies revealed distinct labeling of microvilli-bearing cells after incubation with at least 10 U/ml IFN-gamma/Au, whereas cells with a smooth surface showed substantially lower labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After application of higher IFN-gamma (greater than 200 U/ml) concentrations, labeling intensity remained constant, which is consistent with the concentration of radiolabeled IFN-gamma required for saturating receptors on Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of IFN-gamma/Au binding was demonstrated by complete displacement with unlabeled IFN-gamma and by partial inhibition of labeling with a monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma R antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> represents a valuable tag for visualizing the interaction of IFN-gamma with its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internalization of IFN-gamma/Au was initiated by accumulation of gold particles in coated pits which occurred within 10 min after warming of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional incubation at 37 degrees C (up to 2 h) led to the appearance of gold particles in endocytic vesicles and lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our studies indicate that IFN-gamma/Au enters the Raji cells via the typical endocytotic pathway </plain></SENT>
