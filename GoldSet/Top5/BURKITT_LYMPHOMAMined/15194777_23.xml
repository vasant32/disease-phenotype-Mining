<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived cell line Akata was cloned into a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BAC clone, designated AK-BAC, was rapidly and precisely modified by means of efficient homologous recombination in Escherichia coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This system was used to produce recombinant EBVs with transgenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An expression cassette of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into AK-BAC, and the resultant BAC clone, AK-BAC-GFP, was transfected into Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that transfected BAC plasmids efficiently formed episomes in EBV-positive Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and AK-BAC-GFP viruses were then produced and used to infect EBV-negative Akata cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We obtained cell clones that harbored only AK-BAC-GFP but no <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> episome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cell clones produced infectious viruses after stimulating virus production, and the recombinant viruses of AK-BAC-GFP efficiently immortalized primary B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further revised the method so that any kind of cDNA could be rapidly inserted into the unique I-PpoI site that had been artificially introduced into AK-BAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AK-BAC system will have a broad range of applications, such as genetic analyses of various <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene products and development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vectors for human gene therapy </plain></SENT>
