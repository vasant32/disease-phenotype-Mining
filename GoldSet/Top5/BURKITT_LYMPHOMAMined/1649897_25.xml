<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the EBNA 1 and latent membrane protein encoding regions of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome are highly methylated at CCGG sequences in the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>)-derived cell line Rael, but are unmethylated in a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) harbouring the same virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine whether this is a regular phenomenon, we compared the methylation patterns of selected regions (BamHI C, W, H, M, E, K and N fragments) of EBV DNA in representative EBV-carrying cell types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and neoplastic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of HpaII and MspI cleavage patterns showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probed regions were highly methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> biopsy samples, but hypomethylated in the four LCLs immortalized by the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV DNA was also highly methylated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse-passaged C15 nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> strain and partially methylated in the C18 strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> lines propagated in vitro, ranging from a typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> group I to a more LCL-like group III phenotype, showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> levels of methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rael, the only stable group I cell line, carried highly methylated <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other cell lines, which have drifted to an LCL-like blastic phenotype to various degrees, showed more moderate or low <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two sublines of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell line Jijoye, which could be classified as groups II and III, respectively, showed a corresponding difference in EBV DNA methylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
