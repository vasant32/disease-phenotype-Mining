<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of PTLD is of B-cell origin, and 90% are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (LG) is a rare, EBV-associated systemic angiodestructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, which has rarely been described in patients with renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient with renal transplantation for SLE, who presented, 9 months after renal transplantation, an EBV-associated LG limited to the intracranial structures that recovered completely after adjustment of her immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine years later, she developed a second PTLD disorder with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system initial manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Workup revealed an EBV-positive PTLD Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, widely disseminated in most organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the reported patient presented two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (LG and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>), both with initial neurological manifestation, at 9 years interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With careful reduction of the immunosuppression after the first manifestation and with the use of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy after the second manifestation, our patient showed complete disappearance of neurologic symptoms and she is clinically well with good kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No recurrence has been observed by radiological imaging until now </plain></SENT>
