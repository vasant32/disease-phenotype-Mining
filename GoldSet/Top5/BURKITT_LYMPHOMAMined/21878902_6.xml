<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to direct antitumor activity, rapalogs reverse multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These should facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific T cell activity, but since rapa directly inhibits effector T cells, this potential immune enhancement is lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that if T cells were rendered resistant to rapa they could capitalize on its downregulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> immune evasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore modified T cells with a rapa-resistant mutant of mTor, mTorRR, and directed them to B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> by coexpressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for CD19 (CAR.CD19-28ζ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T cells expressing transgenic mTorRR from a piggyBac transposon maintain mTor signaling, proliferate in the presence of rapa and retain their cytotoxic function and ability to secrete interferon-γ (IFNγ) after stimulation, effector functions that were inhibited by rapa in control T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination, rapa and rapa-resistant-CAR.CD19-28ζ-expressing T cells produced greater antitumor activity against Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pre-B ALL</z:e> cell lines in vitro than CAR.CD19-28ζ T cells or rapa alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the combination of rapa and rapa-resistant, CAR.CD19-28ζ-expressing T cells may provide a novel therapy for the treatment of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
