<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S1P is a chemoattractant for NK cells, which are critical members of the immunological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> surveillance machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we analyzed the influence of S1P on the interaction of NK cells with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells such as the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line Hs294T and the Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line Raji </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that S1P inhibited the cytotoxic activity of NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of signal transduction pathways revealed that S1P induced common signalling pathways of chemotaxins such as Gi protein-dependent actin reorganization and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent signal molecules, protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to most chemotaxins, S1P is also able to activate Gs-dependent signalling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This signalling cascade involves increase of cAMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, blocking the regulatory subunits of PKA I abrogated the inhibitory effect of S1P, whereas the catalytic subunits were not involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that S1P may contributes to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> escape from NK cell-dependent immunological surveillance machinery </plain></SENT>
