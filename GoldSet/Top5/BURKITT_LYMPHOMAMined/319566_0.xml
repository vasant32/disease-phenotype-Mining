<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specificities of AHBS were checked by the cytotoxicity test, inhibition test of EAC-rosetting and inhibition of PWM responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raji cells of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> originating from B-cells and acknowledged as non-immunoglobulin bearing on the cell surface were stained with AHBS according to the immunofluorescent technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATOS showed a higher cytotoxic titer against peripheral B-cells and inhibited EAC-rosetting stronger than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASPS</z:e> did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, macrophages in peripheral blood, Kupffer cells in the liver and certain cells of the thymus-medulla were stained with ASPA, but not with ATOS, even after intensively absorbing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASPS</z:e> with thymocytes </plain></SENT>
