<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparotomy without total excision of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> does not have a positive effect on survival, might cause complications, and delays initiation of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present our diagnostic management of patients with abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnostic methods of abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases treated between January 1999 and December 2009 were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 48 abdominal Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients, 13 also had extra-abdominal site involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made with ultrasound-guided tru-cut needle biopsy of the abdominal mass (n = 11), fluid cytology (n = 7), extra-abdominal site biopsy (n = 4), bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> (n = 2), gastroscopy (n = 1), and laparotomy (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients diagnosed with laparotomy, chemotherapy was started in 4-22 days (median 7) compared with patients diagnosed with other diagnostic interventions in 2-4 days (median 2) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the most frequently used technique is laparotomy and open biopsy in our series, other methods provided quicker initiation of chemotherapy and less surgical morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Especially in patients with high stages, cytological evaluation and tru-cut needle biopsy with radiological guidance is a better alternative of laparotomy </plain></SENT>
