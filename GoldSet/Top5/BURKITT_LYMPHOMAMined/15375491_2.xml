<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have suggested that EBV-related antigen-targeting immunotherapy is one of the promising approaches for the treatment of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> other than gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV-associated gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (EBVaGC) has been shown to express Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, DNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> freshly isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using EBV-specific primers and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR specific for LMP2 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EBV-specific region was identified in genomic DNA isolated from cancerous tissues in 22% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LMP2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also detected in 3 out of these 5 DNA positive samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the feasibility of specific immunotherapy for EBVaGC, we induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from peripheral blood lymphocytes using two kinds of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as autologous lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) and LMP2-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of these CTLs against <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-pulsed targets was examined by standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay and interferon (IFN)-gamma production assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further assessed the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells endogenously expressing LMP2 by these T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T cells induced by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-loaded DCs and autologous LCL efficiently lysed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-pulsed targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these T cells could recognize not only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells transfected with LMP2, but also LMP2-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> cells which were successfully isolated and cultured from specimens obtained by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, sensitization of peripheral blood lymphocytes with LMP2-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was able to induce CTL response against EBVaGC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, EBVaGC is susceptible for the LMP2-targeting immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
