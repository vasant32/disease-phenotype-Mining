<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells are characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the proto-oncogene c-myc on chromosome 8 and one of the immunoglobulin gene loci on chromosome 2, 14 or 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The translocated c-myc allele is transcriptionally activated, shows a preferential usage of promoter P1 over P2 (promoter shift) and lacks the ability to retain the transcription complex at the P2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to define the elements of the immunoglobulin kappa gene involved in deregulation of c-myc in a t(2;8) translocation, we designed constructs consisting of c-myc and different parts of the immunoglobulin kappa gene locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromatin analysis of these stably transfected constructs revealed DNase I hypersensitive sites within the c-myc 5' region characteristic for an actively transcribed c-myc gene and three sites within the immunoglobulin kappa locus corresponding to the matrix attachment region, the intron and 3' enhancers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These three regulatory elements were necessary and sufficient for maximal c-myc activation and formation of the promoter shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kinetic nuclear run on experiments were performed to study the distribution of transcription complexes on c-myc exon 1 on constructs with and without the immunoglobulin kappa regulatory elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of a pausing polymerase complex at the c-myc P2 promoter could be demonstrated for constructs consisting of c-myc and the two kappa enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore the two enhancers are sufficient to relief the elongational block at the P2 promoter, however, the matrix attachment region is additionally required for maximal c-myc activation observed in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
