<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein coincided very closely with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GPD; EC 1.2.1.12) derived from various origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially, it was completely homologous with that of human liver GPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several GPD's derived from human erythrocyte, rabbit muscle and Bacillus stearothermophilus also stimulated IgM production of hybridomas, as well as IPSF-II alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, IPSF-II alpha had GPD enzymic activity as strong as rabbit muscle and B. stearothermophilus, and stronger than human erythrocyte GPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that 36 KD subunit of IPSF-II alpha was a GPD, or GPD like protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for IgM was not enhanced by IPSF-II alpha in hybridoma cells, though the IgM productivity of the cell was remarkably stimulated by the protein, indicating that IPSF-II alpha does not stimulate immunoglobulin production by enhancement of transcription </plain></SENT>
