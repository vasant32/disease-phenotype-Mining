<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CBA/H mouse model of radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) was re-examined using molecular approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the typical promyelocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e>, 34% were reclassified as early pre-B lympho-myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> (L-ML) based on leukemic blood cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene re-arrangements (IgH(R)), or expression of both lymphoid (Vpre-B1 and Rag1) and myeloid (myeloperoxidase and lysozyme M) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allelic loss on chromosome 4 was frequently detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMLs</z:e> (53%) and L-MLs (more than 95%), and the preferential loss of the maternally transmitted allele suggests the locus may be imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A minimally deleted region (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) maps to a 3.4-cM interval, which is frequently deleted in radiation-induced thymic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (TLSR5) and contains a recessive, maternally transmitted genetic locus (Lyr2) that confers resistance to spontaneous and radiation-induced pre-B and T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, suggesting they are one and the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Lyr2/TLSR5 locus is frequently implicated in myeloid, lymphoid (B and T), and mixed-lineage mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic inactivation of one Lyr2/TLSR5 allele during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse development suggests that only a single hit is required for its inactivation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e>, and this may be a significant contributing factor to the efficiency of the leukemogenic process in the mouse </plain></SENT>
