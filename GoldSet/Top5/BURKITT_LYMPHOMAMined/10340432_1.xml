<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hydrazinolysis was used to liberate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> backbone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After HPLC separation of fluorescently labelled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> similar profiles of neutral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> were observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> of healthy subjects, pregnant women, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bartter's syndrome</z:e>, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and a patient with carbohydrate deficient <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> contains Man-5, Man-6 and Man-7 glycans, with the preponderant amount of Man-6 glycan (about 7% of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> profiles between control subjects and pregnant women or patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is likely that neither pregnancy nor the pathological conditions examined affect high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our opinion hydrazinolysis as a method of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> liberation, in contrast to enzymatic deglycosylation, is more appropriate for analysis of the sugar moiety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
