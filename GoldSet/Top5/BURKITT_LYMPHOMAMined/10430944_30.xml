<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in nonimmunocompromised patients, EBV gene expression is highly restricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 is expressed, whereas the immunogenic and proliferative EBNAs are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pattern of EBNA expression is generated by usage of the BamHI-Q promoter (Qp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined that the JAK/STAT pathway positively regulates Qp activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In transient-transfection assays, a Qp-CAT reporter was activated by cotransfected JAK-1 and by treatment of cells with the cytokine IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of Qp to bind signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins was directly demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay, and mutation of potential STAT-binding sites reduced Qp responsiveness to Janus kinase (JAK)-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a role for STATs in Qp function, Qp using Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> Rael cells and cultured nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC) cells contained nuclear STAT protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the inability to maintain EBV-positive NPC cell lines in culture was related to Qp activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Passaging of the NPC cell line HK666 led to activation of expression of BZLF1, which encodes Zta and loss of Qp function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient expression assays linked Zta expression to the down-regulation of Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cotransfection of Zta reduced Qp activity in reporter assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This negative regulation required Zta DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that Zta up-regulation of p53 leads to p53-mediated interference with JAK/STAT activation of Qp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data imply that JAK/STAT signaling has a role in EBV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
