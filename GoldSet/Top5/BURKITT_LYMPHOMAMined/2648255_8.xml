<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated rapid down-regulation of the steady-state levels of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> during DMSO induced differentiation of the human 'promyelocytic' cell line, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the effect of DMSO on c-myc regulation in cells which are not induced to differentiate by DMSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of DMSO on c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels in a number of cell lines with different lesions in the c-myc gene, including those which do not differentiate in response to DMSO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that DMSO induces a rapid, but transient, reduction in the steady-state level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in human 'erythroid' K562 cells, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> lines Daudi and Raji, human T cell lymphoblastoid line CEM and mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line L1210 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, DMSO treatment does not produce a similar effect in the human <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line COLO 320 or HeLa epithelial cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrate that the DMSO induced modulation of c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> levels is a more common phenomenon than previously recognised, and is not necessarily correlated with either the induction of cellular differentiation or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
