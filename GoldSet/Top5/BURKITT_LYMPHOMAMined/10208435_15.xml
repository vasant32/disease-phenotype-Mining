<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-myc gene becomes transcriptionally activated as a consequence of the chromosomal translocation and shows preferential usage of promoter P1 over P2, a phenomenon referred to as promoter shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to define the responsible regulatory elements within the Ig lambda locus, we studied the effect of the human Ig lambda enhancer (HuE lambda) on c-myc expression after stable transfection into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 12 kb genomic fragment encompassing HuE lambda, but not HuE lambda alone, strongly activated c-myc expression and induced the promoter shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify additional elements involved in c-myc deregulation, we mapped DNaseI hypersensitive sites within the 12 kb lambda fragment on the construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides one hypersensitive site corresponding to HuE lambda, three additional sites were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these elements displayed enhancer activity after transient transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third element did not activate c-myc transcription, but was required for full c-myc activation and promoter shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deletion analyses of the c-myc promoter identified the immediate promoter region as sufficient for activation by the Ig lambda. locus, but also revealed that induction of the promoter shift requires additional upstream elements </plain></SENT>
