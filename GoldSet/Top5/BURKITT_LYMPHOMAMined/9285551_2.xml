<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its real incidence, however, could be underestimated, since histologic and immunophenotyping techniques are often unable to distinguish it from a relapse </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequencing analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes showed that the rearrangement of variable, diversity and joining segments had changed between diagnosis and relapse and suggested that a second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> had developed </plain></SENT>
