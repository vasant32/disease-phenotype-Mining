<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> (DNR) induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in some leukemic myeloid cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a potential protective role for Bcl-2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by DNR in two leukemic cell lines, one myeloid and one lymphoid, overexpressing the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parental cells treated with DNR exhibited classical features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> 6 h after drug exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells being dead after 30-48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly delayed, but did not prevent the occurrence of DNR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, with no surviving cells 96 h after drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of the protection mediated by Bcl-2, we explored the signaling pathway which initiates DNR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that, in both the myeloid and lymphoid parental cell lines, DNR triggered a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> (SM) hydrolysis after 10-15 min with a concomitant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, exogenous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> induced DNA fragmentation in these cells, with levels similar to those observed with DNR treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Bcl-2 overexpression protected the cells against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> treatment, without preventing the early SM hydrolysis nor the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> generation in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that Bcl-2-mediated protection of DNR-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is effected downstream of the SM-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
