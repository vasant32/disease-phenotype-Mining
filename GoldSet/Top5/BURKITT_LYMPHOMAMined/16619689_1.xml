<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kenyatta National Hospital and seven provincial hospitals in Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Histologically proven cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in patients less than 16 years of age were clinically examined and investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For every case the following parameters were documented: chief complaint(s); physical examination, specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, presence of masses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reports of evaluation of chest radiograph, abdominal ultrasound/scan, bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, cerebral spinal fluid cytology, liver and kidney function tests, urinalysis, stool occult blood and full blood count results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stage of disease was assigned A, B, C or D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> from three provinces of Kenya with diverse geographical features were analysed: Central, Coast, and Western </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study documented 471 BL cases distributed as follows: Central 61 (males 39 and 22 females), M:F ratio 1.8:1; Coast 169 (111 males and 58 females), M:F ratio 1.9:1; and Western 241 (140 males and 101 females), M:F ratio 1.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major presenting complaints were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal swelling</z:hpo>--Central 36%, Coast 4% and Western 26%; swelling on the face--Central 31%, Coast 81% and Western 64%; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>--Central 3%, Coast 1% and Western 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of these complaints in weeks were Central 6.9, Coast 6.08, and Western 5.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The initial physical finding was a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> mass in 39%, 72% and 54% of cases for Central, Coast and Western respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> stage at diagnosis was: stage A--Central 21%, Coast 43% and Western 34%; stage B--Central 10%, Coast 5% and Western 10%; stage C--Central 41%, Coast 34% and Western 30%; and stage D--Central 28%, Coast 17% and Western 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the age and sex matched cases the results show that commonly involved sites were: abdomen--Central 35%, Coast 9% and Western 14%; jaw (mandible)--Central 24%, Coast 22% and Western 31%; maxilla--Central 6%, Coast 24% and Western 11%; and lymph nodes--Central 10%, Coast 4% and Western 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The disease stage was A--Central 33%, Coast 44% and Western 36%; stage B--Central 11%, Coast 10% and Western 27%; stage C--Central 39%, Coast 34% and Western 27%; and stage D--Central 21%, Coast 13% and Western 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that clinical features of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> vary with geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The variations are documented in proportion of jaw, maxilla, abdominal and lymph nodal sites involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The differences observed are potentially due to the local environmental factors within these provinces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases from Western province had features, intermediate between endemic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Coastal province <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases were similar to endemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases from Central province resembled more or less <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Strategies to explain and investigate the local environmental factors associated with the observed differences may certainly contribute towards improved understanding and clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
