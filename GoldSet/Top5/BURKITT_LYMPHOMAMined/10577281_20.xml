<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found decreased expression of ING1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in 4 of 5 T-cell lines and 5 of 11 B-cell lines including two Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and two <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myelomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that decreased ING1 expression might play an important role in the development or progression of some <z:mp ids='MP_0002022'>lymphoid tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-SSCP and sequencing analyses found neither point mutations nor small deletions in the ING1 gene, suggesting that decreased expression is due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms </plain></SENT>
