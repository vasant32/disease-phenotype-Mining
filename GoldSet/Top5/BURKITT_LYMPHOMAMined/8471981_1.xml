<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The series comprised cases diagnosed and immunophenotyped in 43 Italian centers (GIMEMA Cooperative Group) between April 1988 and June 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotypic characterization consisted of two consecutive steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial screening was based on the reactivity for TdT, HLA-Dr, CD7, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD24, CD33 and CD41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the results obtained, the second level of investigation assessed the positivity for intra cytoplasmic (Cy) Ig, CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8 and CD20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the hierarchical expression of the different B- and T-cell related antigens, each case was assigned to a given differentiation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B-lineage ALL were classified in five subgroups (B0-B4) and T-lineage ALL in four subgroups (T0-T3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases in which the blasts were lymphoid according to the FAB criteria, but expressed myeloid antigens in association with B- and T-lymphoid markers were defined as hybrid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, CD10+ cases (B2-B3) were the most frequent within the B-lineage ALL (83.2% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CyIg+ (B3) accounted for about 20% of CD10+ ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty eight cases (13.4%) were at a pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1292769" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cALL</z:e> stage (B0-B1) and of these, 8 (3.8% of the total series) were positive only for TdT and HLA-Dr (B0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intermediate and mature thymic phenotypes (T2-T3) were predominant within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> (67.2%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five cases, were positive only for TdT and CD7 (CD5+), and classified as T0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>9.2% of cases fulfilled the definition of hybrid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, largely in view of the co-expression of B-lymphoid and myeloid markers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
