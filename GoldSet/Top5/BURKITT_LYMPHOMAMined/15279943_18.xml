<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrokinetics utilises electrically energised microelectrode structures within microfluidic chambers to noninvasively probe the physiological structure of live <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A system is described that combines the three complementary techniques of dielectrophoresis (DEP), travelling wave dielectrophoresis (TWD) and electrorotation (ROT) for the first time on a single, integrated chip (3 x 6 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chip employs planar microelectrode arrays fabricated on a silicon substrate to facilitate the synthesis of the various nonuniform electric fields required for the controlled manipulation, measurement and characterization of mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A study of the dielectric properties of human malignant cells (Daudi and NCI-H929) was performed to demonstrate the potential and the versatility of the system in providing a fully programmable microsystem </plain></SENT>
