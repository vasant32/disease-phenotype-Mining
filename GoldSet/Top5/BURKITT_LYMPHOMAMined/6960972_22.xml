<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A specific translocation was found in 26 of the patients: 20 t(8;14), 4 t(8;22), and 1 t(2;8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one other case only 2 mitoses out of 59 were found to have a probable t(8;22) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional chromosomal abnormalities were found in 15 of the patients, irrespective of whether they had or had not been treated before cytogenetic investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most remarkable was a partial duplication of chromosome 1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities together with a specific translocation allows a distinction to be made between specific and secondary chromosome anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implications of the two types of aberrations for research into the molecular mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
