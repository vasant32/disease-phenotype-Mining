<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analysed the organization of V delta genes and delta recombining element (delta Rec) in 27 children with B-cell precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 54 alleles showed rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements resulted either from D2D delta 3 (2 alleles) or V delta 2(Dn)D delta 3 (20 alleles) recombinations, and the other V delta and delta Rec were not rearranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 23 alleles with deletion of C delta and rearrangements of J alpha, V delta 2, V delta 4 and V delta 5 appeared to rearrange to J alpha on five alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to the relationship between the rearranged V alpha/delta and J alpha genes, gene segments 5' to V delta 2 frequently rearranged to J alpha more proximal to C alpha, whereas V delta 2 and gene segments 3' to V delta 2 showed a tendency to rearrange to J alpha distal to C alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we suggest that the initial recombination event of the TCR-alpha/delta gene may be D2D delta 3 joining, followed by V delta 2 recombination with the D2D delta 3 complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was also suggested that use of V alpha/delta and J alpha/delta may depend on the distance between the involved V alpha/delta and J alpha/delta at least in B-lineage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These rearrangements in B-precursor cells appear to be aberrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this recombinational process may be one of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> differentiation pathways in T-lineage cells, because cells with a V delta 2(Dn)D delta 3 rearrangement were detected in 0.1-0.01% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral mononuclear cells by the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
