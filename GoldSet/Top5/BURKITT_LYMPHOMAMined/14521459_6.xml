<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with 2 such unusual cases of pediatric B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic features of the leukemic blast cells were reviewed in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The leukemic blast cells in both cases were small to medium with scant basophilic cytoplasm and several small inconspicuous nucleoli, characteristic of L1 lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypically, they were positive for CD19, CD22, and low-density CD20, with expression of surface immunoglobulin lambda light chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were negative for immature (CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), myeloid, and T-cell-associated markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies failed to demonstrate chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients were treated with Children's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Group ALL protocols and had good responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B-lineage ALL with a mature phenotype, L1 <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and absent chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc gene is best classified and managed as precursor B-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> instead of Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
