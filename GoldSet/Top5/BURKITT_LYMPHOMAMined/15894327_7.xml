<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, TLR9 expression on B lymphocytes appears to be dependent upon both the state of activation and differentiation of the B cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, TLR9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was evaluated in transformed human B cell lines and correlated with their response to CpG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the B cell lines, the Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-derived Namalwa line had the highest level of TLR9 expression, 20-fold greater than spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following incubation with CpG oligonucleotide, Namalwa cells secreted increased amounts of TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 and expressed the costimulator molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These functional responses to TLR9 activation occurred with similar EC(50) values in the 30- to 60-nM range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the Namalwa Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> line may serve as a useful cell-based assay for the detection of novel TLR9 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> as well as a model to further explore the regulation of TLR9 expression and signaling </plain></SENT>
