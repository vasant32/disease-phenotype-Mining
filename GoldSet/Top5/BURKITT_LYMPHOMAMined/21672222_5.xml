<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumor</z:e> cells from the bloodstream into lymph nodes is thought to be facilitated by expression of the chemokine receptors CCR7, CXCR4 and, for B cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, CXCR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of their respective chemokine ligands (CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12 and CXCL13) by endothelial cells inside the lymph nodes facilitates the trans-endothelial migration (TEM) of these cells through high endothelial venules into the lymph node parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is known that CXCR7, a second CXCL12 receptor, regulates TEM of CXCR4+CXCR7+ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells towards a CXCL12 source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we set out to assess the potential stimulation by CXCL12 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell TEM towards other chemokines and whether CXCR7 might be able to regulate such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The human Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line NC-37, which expresses CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR7 and CCR7, was selected as a model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TEM of these cells through a human HUVEC endothelial cell monolayer was used as the main model system for these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regulation of their TEM behavior by various concentrations of the various cognate chemokines for the above-mentioned receptors, placed in either the source or target wells of modified Boyden chamber migration plates, was assessed by quantifying the number of cells migrated under each experimental condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure of CXCR4⁺CXCR7⁺ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to CXCL12 greatly potentiated their TEM towards the chemokines CCL19 and CXCL13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This CXCL12-potentiated TEM was inhibited by the second CXCR7 chemokine ligand, CXCL11, as well as CXCR7-specific small molecule <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CXCR4 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AMD3100 was less effective at inhibiting CXCL12-potentiated TEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, CXCR7 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be effective therapeutic agents for blocking CXCL12-mediated migration of CXCR4⁺CXCR7⁺ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells into lymph nodes, regardless of whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells follow a CXCL12 gradient or whether serum CXCL12 stimulates their migration towards CCR7 and CXCR5 chemokines in the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
