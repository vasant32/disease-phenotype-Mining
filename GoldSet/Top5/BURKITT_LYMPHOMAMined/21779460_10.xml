<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hematopoiesis is a process capable of generating millions of cells every second, as distributed in many cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The process is regulated by a number of transcription factors that regulate the differentiation along the distinct lineages and dictate the genetic program that defines each mature phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myc was first discovered as the oncogene of avian leukemogenic retroviruses; it was later found translocated in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From then on, evidence accumulated showing that c-Myc is one of the transcription factors playing a major role in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study of genetically modified mice with overexpression or deletion of Myc has shown that c-Myc is required for the correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enforced Myc expression in mice leads to reduced <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> pools owing to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of increased proliferation of progenitor cells and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>c-Myc deficiency consistently results in the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other models with conditional Myc deletion have demonstrated that different lineages of hematopoietic cells differ in their requirement for c-Myc to regulate their proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When transgenic mice overexpress c-Myc or N-Myc in mature cells from the lymphoid or myeloid lineages, the result is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In agreement, enforced expression of c-Myc blocks the differentiation in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-derived cell lines capable of differentiating in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Not surprising, MYC deregulation is recurrently found in many types of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whereas MYC is deregulated by translocation in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and, less frequently, other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, MYC is frequently overexpressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, through mechanisms unrelated to chromosomal translocation, and is often associated with disease progression </plain></SENT>
