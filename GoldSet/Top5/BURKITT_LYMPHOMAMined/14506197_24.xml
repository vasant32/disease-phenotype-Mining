<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Epratuzumab is a novel humanized antihuman CD22 IgG1 antibody that has recently shown promising clinical activity, both as a single agent and in combination with rituximab, in patients with non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (NHL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to better understand the mode of action of epratuzumab, the antibody was tested in vitro in a variety of cell-based assays similar to those used to evaluate the biological activity of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, including rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we present epratuzumab activities as they relate to binding, signaling, and internalization of the receptor CD22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chinese hamster ovary-expressed CD22 extracellular domain was used to measure epratuzumab affinity on Biacore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD22 receptor density and internalization rate were measured indirectly using a monovalently labeled, noncompeting (with epratuzumab) anti-CD22 antibody on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines, primary B cells derived from fresh tonsils, and B cells separated from peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> or healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epratuzumab-induced CD22 phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitation/Western blot and compared with that induced by anti-IgM stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Epratuzumab binds to CD22-extracellular domain, with an affinity of K(D) = 0.7 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding of epratuzumab to B cell lines, or primary B cells from healthy individuals and patients with NHL, results in rapid internalization of the CD22/antibody complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Internalization appears to be faster at early time points in cell lines than in primary B cells and NHL patient-derived B cells, but the maximum internalization reached is comparable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B cell populations after several hours of treatment and appears to reach saturation at antibody concentrations of 1-5 micro g/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, epratuzumab binding results in modest but significant CD22 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Epratuzumab represents an excellent anti-CD22 ligating agent, highly efficacious in inducing CD22 internalization, and can induce phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot unequivocally demonstrate here that epratuzumab-induced internalization and signaling of CD22 directly contribute to its therapeutic efficacy, these properties are the fundamental characteristics of the target CD22 and its interaction with epratuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed when epratuzumab was tested in vitro on Burkitt B cell lines as well as on primary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B cells and neoplastic B cells separated from fresh peripheral blood samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
