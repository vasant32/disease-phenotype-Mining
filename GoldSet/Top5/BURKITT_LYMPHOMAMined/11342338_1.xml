<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study hair and serum zinc and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels were investigated in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (ML) at the time of initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
