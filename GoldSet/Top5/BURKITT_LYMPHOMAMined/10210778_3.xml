<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical animal models and in vitro data afford evidence for anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many reports have underlined the interest of interleukin-7 (IL-7) use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and its pivotal role in immune recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cytokine, initially identified as a B cell growth factor, enhances the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> properties of immune effector cells via T lymphocyte activation, increased specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, few data are available regarding the effect of IL-7 on the expression at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> cell surface of molecules involved in the immune response, which defective expression could induce tolerance or anergy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to study the effects of IL-7 on 20 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 9 cases of lymphoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL), in comparison with gamma-interferon, a potent inducer of immune regulation molecule expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL, IL-7 increased MHC class I molecule expression, while class II molecules were weakly modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor family members CD40 and Fas/CD95, together with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules ICAM-1/CD54 and CD58/LFA-3, was also increased in both types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IL-7 was an efficient inducer of B7-2/CD86 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and ALL, while increased expression of B7-1/CD80 was only observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the corresponding, co-cultured T lymphocyte population, IL-7 more particularly increased B7-1/CD80 and CD58/LFA-3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, pre-incubation of leukaemic cells with IL-7 increased the proliferation of responding, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allogenic T lymphocytes and their secretion of gamma-IFN and IL-2 in mixed the lymphocyte-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that IL-7 is efficient at increasing the membrane expression of molecules which are central for the development of the immune response, and at improving allogenic immune recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of such data require further in vivo investigation </plain></SENT>
