<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, nonproliferating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed low levels of the 50-kD cyclin E, ALL blasts in the peripheral blood, although showing low-level or no proliferation as judged by FACS/cell-cycle analysis and cyclin A protein levels, expressed high levels of cyclin E, with a mean value similar to that of the proliferating Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line, Akata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of a protein shown to shorten the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cyclin E, in growth-delayed leukemic blasts may reflect the malignant status of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> cells expressed predominantly the 50-kD cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">T-ALL</z:e> samples displayed the 50-kD cyclin E protein and a smaller, approximately 43-kD cyclin E species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023435" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">B-ALL</z:e> samples taken before treatment and at relapse, we found a significant overexpression of the 50-kD protein in relapsed samples (P &lt; .006), plus the presence of up to four additional smaller-molecular-weight species of cyclin E, illustrating clear diagnosis versus relapse differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclin E expression in ALL blasts may correlate to the relative malignant status of the cells, with higher protein levels reflecting a more advanced stage of the disease and a greater potential to proliferate under permissive conditions </plain></SENT>
