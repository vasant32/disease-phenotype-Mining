<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have defined three phases including: (1) initiation, (2) maintenance, and (3) termination of the antiproliferative state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each phase is characterized by specific growth modulatory properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initiation of the antiproliferative state with a single interferon dose requires 200 International Reference Units (IRU) per ml, depending on such factors including cell density, serum content in the medium and the length of IFN exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initiation of the IFN response occurred within a 4 h incubation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even following this short exposure, the vast majority of cells would be sequestered in the G0/G1 cell cycle compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As measured by cytofluorimetry there was a 16-20 h delay in the initiation of the antiproliferative response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative response, as measured by changes in the distribution of cells in the cell cycle, was maximal at 24 h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This delay was equal to the doubling time of the Daudi cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative response initiated by 200 IRU/ml of IFN was reversible if the IFN was removed and not replenished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells showed renewed growth approximately 40 h after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The antiproliferative state could be maintained by additional interferon, but, even after such treatment, the antiproliferative state decayed in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This decay was proportional to the decrease in the biological activity of the interferon molecule itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that the antiproliferative state could be maintained by using only 40 IRU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These cells were maintained in the antiproliferative state for an extended period of time </plain></SENT>
