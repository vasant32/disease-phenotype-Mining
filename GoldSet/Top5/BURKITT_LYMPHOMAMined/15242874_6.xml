<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have established human B-lineage (BLIN) <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines that retain a dependency on fibroblast monolayers for survival and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight hours following removal from adherent cell contact BLIN cells undergo a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential and an increase in annexin V binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the caspase-9 inhibitor (C9i) benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone enhanced the appearance of apoptotic cells within 8 hours following removal of BLIN cells from fibroblast monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C9i enhancement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was dose dependent and did not occur with irreversible inhibitors of caspases-2, -3, -6, and -8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C9i also enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cord blood-derived CD19(+) B-lineage cells (but not myeloid cells) removed from murine stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longer exposure (&gt; 18 hours) to C9i culminated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a panel of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) cell lines in the presence or absence of fibroblast monolayers, as well as in 2 proliferating leukemic cell lines (RAMOS and CEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BLIN-4L cells made deficient in caspase-9 by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference exhibited no resistance to apoptotic signals and actually showed increased apoptotic sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15738">staurosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These collective results suggest that a 4-amino acid caspase inhibitor of caspase-9 can promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and that at least some types of apoptotic pathways in B-lineage ALL do not require caspase-9 </plain></SENT>
