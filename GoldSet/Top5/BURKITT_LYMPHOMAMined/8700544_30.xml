<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined sequence variations in the EBNA-1 protein of EBV in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We find two EBNA-1 strains P (prototype) and V (variant) which differ by 15 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each strain has two subtypes defined by the amino acid at position 487 (P-ala, P-thr, V-pro and V-leu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In PBLs from 32 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, up to three of these subtypes were found in each sample, but the V strain did not occur in the absence of P strain viruses, nor was the V-leu subtype ever observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BLs</z:e> only a single subtype was observed in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P-thr and V-leu subtypes were more frequently seen than the P-ala and V-pro subtypes, which occurred in only two and one of the 36 tumor samples respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The P-thr was the most commonly observed subtype in peripheral blood of both American and African lymphocytes as well as in African <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in 11 of 12 American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the EBNA-1 subtype was V-leu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that some EBNA-1 subtypes are more likely to lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e>, and one subtype, V-leu, appears only to occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
