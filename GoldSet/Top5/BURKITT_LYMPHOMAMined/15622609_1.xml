<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In a series of 1005 cases of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> studied for epidemiological and clinical characteristics, some features remain less obvious contrary to what is commonly held about this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To use the case series to document the challenges in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) in Kenya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross sectional study involving clinical review of case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Kenyatta National Hospital and the seven provincial hospitals in Kenya during the period between 1986 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of the epidemiological and clinical features of the 1005 cases enrolled in the case study and review of reference lists of retrieved articles to identify original research dealing with the epidemiological and clinical features of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: The investigators and research assistants screened both the case series and published information and data to yield relevant information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The majority of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cases between the age group three and nine years of age coincide with the established epidemiological and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cases and some childhood cases however do not conform entirely to the established characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, making the diagnosis of Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> require that; geographical, demographical, clinical features as well as any underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> for instance, Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>Immunodeficiency</z:hpo> Virus be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
