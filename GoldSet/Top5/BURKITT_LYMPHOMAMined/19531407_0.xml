<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out over a period of 8 months on patients who had single tooth extraction and routine histopathologic examination of recoverable periradicular tissues from extracted teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 136 patients participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a male/female incidence ratio of 3:2 and most of the patients with histopathologically diagnosed lesions were within the first, second, and third decades of life (n = 49, 36.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five (55.2%) cases had histopathologically diagnosed periradicular lesions, which were mostly periapical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n = 30, 22.8%) and inflammatory (periapical) granuloma (n = 23, 16.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some clinical and radiologic features were associated significantly with histopathologic diagnosis of some periradicular lesions (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There also was a significant correlation of clinical diagnosis with histopathologic diagnosis of inflammatory (periapical) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031029" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granuloma, periapical</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo>, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a higher contributory percentage of histopathologic diagnoses after routine biopsies, compared to previous reports from selected biopsies of periradicular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified clinical indicators for predicting possible histopathologic diagnosis of some periradicular lesions, in particular, those that predict possible histologic diagnosis of neoplastic periradicular lesions </plain></SENT>
