<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The isolated Epstein-Barr virus DNA had a density of 1.716-1.717 g/cm(3) in CsCl equilibrium centrifugation, which is very close to the virus DNA density of 1.718 g/cm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the majority of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in virus nonproductive cells is not covalently integrated into high-molecular-weight cell DNA </plain></SENT>
