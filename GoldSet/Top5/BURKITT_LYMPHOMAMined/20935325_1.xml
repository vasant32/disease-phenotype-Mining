<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (FAP) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> disease, a long period is expected between domino liver transplantation (DLT) and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in recipients of a FAP liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, as time passes, and increased numbers of patients have undergone DLT, patients with symptoms suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe, for the first time, pathological findings in an autopsy case of a recipient of a FAP liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A male patient with primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> received a liver graft from a FAP patient with the transthyretin (TTR) Tyr114Cys mutation when he was 30 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although a recurrence of primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> was detected at age 34, he had no symptoms indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He died from Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at 38 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TTR immunoreactive amyloid was found in various organs including the heart, lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, spleen, reproductive system and skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, TTR immunoreactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> was obvious in the sympathetic ganglia and the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, while loss of neurons or nerve fibres was not apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case allows for the characterisation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> during the asymptomatic stage of FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Widespread <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> may occur before tissue damage in this disease </plain></SENT>
