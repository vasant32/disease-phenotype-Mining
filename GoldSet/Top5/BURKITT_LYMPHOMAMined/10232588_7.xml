<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Signals that control MDM2 expression are poorly understood but are likely to play an important role in the regulation of p53 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that the half-life of MDM2 protein is shorter in proliferating than in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that MDM2 protein half-life is extended in some, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p53 mutant human leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In at least one of these p53 mutant lines, increased MDM2 protein stability is associated with higher amounts of MDM2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that MDM2 protein accumulates to a much greater extent in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi>-treated cells containing unstable MDM2 than in cells possessing stable MDM2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that MDM2 expression is regulated by events that control the stability of the protein and suggest that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regulation of MDM2 turnover can be altered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
