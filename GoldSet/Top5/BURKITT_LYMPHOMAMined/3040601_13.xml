<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RIA was highly sensitive, specific and reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> EBV-negative cell lines were LMP-negative and 18 of 21 EBV-carrying cells were LMP-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMP concentrations varied widely, ranging approximately from less than 4 ng up to 650 ng/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In several instances comparisons were made between lymphoblastoid (LCLs) and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines (EBV-positive or EBV-converted sublines of originally EBV-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) originating from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such cases LMP and LMP-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were higher in the LCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the LMP was found in the cytosol fraction, yet this fraction was negative in immunoblotting tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, antiserum preincubated with the cytosol lost its ability to react in immunoblotting with membrane LMP, indicating that the 2 LMP forms (membrane and cytosol) are completely cross-reactive </plain></SENT>
