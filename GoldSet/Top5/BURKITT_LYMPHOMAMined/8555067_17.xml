<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The immunological detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) has been hampered by the fact that the leukaemic cells represent the malignant counterparts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> haemopoietic precursors expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD10 and CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used quantitative double-labelling flow cytometry with standard fluorescent beads to convert the mean fluorescence to the number of antigen molecules per cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of TdT, CD10 and CD19 molecules per cell was determined in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B-cell precursors from 22 healthy donors and eight regenerating marrows from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in 20 cases of B-lineage ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow we characterized two different B-cell populations: TdT+/CD10+/CD19+ and TdT-/CD10+/CD19+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a major difference in the level of expression of TdT, CD10 and CD19 between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and B-lineage ALL blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> TdT+ precursors have significantly higher number of TdT (&gt; 100 x 10(3)) and lower number of CD10 (&lt; 50 x 10(3)) and CD19 (&lt; 10 x 10(3)) molecules per cell than B-lineage ALL blasts (&lt; 100, &gt; 50, &gt; 10 x 10(3) molecules per cell respectively); these differences were statistically highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regenerating marrows had a significantly higher percentage of B-cell precursors than healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increase was at the expense of the TdT-/CD10+/CD19+ population which, in the context of B-lineage ALL, could be wrongly interpreted as evidence of relapse if TdT is not included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore the quantitative analysis of TdT combined with CD10 and CD19 may allow a clear distinction between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursors and minimal residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in B-lineage ALL and avoid the pitfall of misinterpreting regenerating B-cells as evidence of relapse </plain></SENT>
