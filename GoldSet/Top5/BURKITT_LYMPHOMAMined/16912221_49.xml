<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) is emerging as a promising target for antitumor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism that contributes to its regulation in B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study shows that in follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FL) cells, mTOR is active because the cells displayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>-sensitive phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunohistochemistry applied on lymph node tissue sections obtained from patients with FL revealed that, in most cases, p70S6 kinase was highly phosphorylated compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonsillar tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FL cells, mTOR was under control of both phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated that Syk plays a central role in mTOR activation because we found that both expression and activity are elevated compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also provide evidence that Syk operates through PLD- and PI3K-independent pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, Syk inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28814">piceatannol</z:chebi> or by siRNA plasmids resulted in a potent inhibition of mTOR activity in FL cells, as well as in mantle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the Syk-mTOR pathway has a critical function in FL survival, and therefore, that Syk could be a promising new target for B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
