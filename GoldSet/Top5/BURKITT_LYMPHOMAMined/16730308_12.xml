<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was performed in 7 of 18 patients, and tissue biopsy/resection was available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were 33 to 91 years old (median, 61); 17 were women and 1 was a man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was consistent with the tissue diagnosis in 6 of the 7 cases (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One case was diagnosed by fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> as atypical cells, favor benign; the biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue diagnoses revealed that 11 cases (61%) represented diffuse large B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and 3 (17%) were follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 4 cases (22%) were plasma cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and precursor B-cell lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry and/or gene rearrangement supported the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a breast mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fine needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> can facilitate appropriate triage of patients for further management </plain></SENT>
