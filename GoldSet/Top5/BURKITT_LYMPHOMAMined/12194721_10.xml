<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children with refractory or recurrent NHL are generally thought to have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those with chemosensitive disease are usually considered for an intensification phase, with either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 2001 we performed 24 HSCTs in 22 children with refractory (n = 8), recurrent (n = 13), or high-risk in first CR (n = 1) NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the HSCTs, 19 were autologous and five were allogeneic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In two children, allogeneic HSCT was performed after failing autologous HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic subtypes comprised large cell, (n = 13), Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 5) and lymphoblastic (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the cases of primary relapse, 10 occurred during therapy and three occurred after completing initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 22 children in this series, two died of transplant-related toxicity and nine died of progressive disease or relapse after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 11 children who are alive and disease-free, 10 had non-lymphoblastic histology and one had lymphoblastic disease; one relapsed after autologous HSCT, but was successfully salvaged with multi-agent chemotherapy and involved-field irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 22 initial transplanted cases, 10 of 19 children with chemosensitive disease before transplantation and one of three with chemoresistant disease are currently alive and disease-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Intensive chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem-cell support is an effective strategy for children with chemosensitive recurrent non-lymphoblastic NHL </plain></SENT>
