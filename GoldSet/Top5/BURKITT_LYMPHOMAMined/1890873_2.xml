<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Test for HIV-antibodies was carried-out in 16 patients; 5 of them (21%) showed HIV positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was involved in 25% of patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases studied for karyotype, the t(8;14) translocation was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As to therapy, 5 patients were not evaluable for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 12 were given an intensive ALL program, 5 a cyclic chemotherapy and 2 a new protocol alternating high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> and the CHOP regimen </plain></SENT>
