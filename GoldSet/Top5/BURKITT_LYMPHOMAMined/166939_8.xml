<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following fractionation of serum from 13 donors, anti-EBNA antibodies were always found to be associated with IgG, but were also detectable in the IgM fraction of four sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential addition of functionally pure complement components in the ACIF reaction showed that the classical sequence of complement activation in involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-EBNA antibody reactions in Raji cell nuclei can also be detected by anti-Ig immunofluorescence with a low level of sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same pattern of granular fluorescence was observed when C3 (beta1A/beta1C), or C4 or IgG anti-EBNA antibodies were revealed with the corresponding flurescein-conjugated reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blocking of the ACIF reaction was achieved with Fab 2 anti-EBNA antibody fragments, which therefore provided an appropriate specificity control for the detection of EBNA </plain></SENT>
