<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improper repair of DSBs during either mitosis or meiosis can lead to mutations, chromosomal aberration such as translocations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and/or cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, no model exists that explains the locations of either spontaneous somatic DSBs or programmed meiotic DSBs or relates them to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One common class of tumorigenic translocations arising from DSBs is chromosomal rearrangements near the Myc oncogene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myc translocations have been associated with Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in humans, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011857'>plasmacytoma</z:hpo> in mice, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242647,C0334633" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunocytoma</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing the locations of somatic and meiotic DSBs near the mouse Myc oncogene, we demonstrated that the placement of these DSBs is not random and that both events clustered in the same short discrete region of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our work shows that both somatic and meiotic DSBs tend to occur in proximity to each other within the Myc region, suggesting that they share common originating features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is likely that some regions of the genome are more susceptible to both somatic and meiotic DSBs, and the locations of meiotic hotspots may be an indicator of genomic regions more susceptible to DNA damage </plain></SENT>
