<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As with the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells, the established line was negative for both cell surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absence of Ig expression was confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis demonstrated homozygous deletion of the C kappa gene, germ line configuration of the C lambda and rearrangement of IgJH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis of both leukemic bone marrow and BALM-16 cells showed the t(8;22)(q24;q11) abnormality which is specifically associated with ALL-L3 and Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's serum showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo>, prompting further investigation of the established cell lines which showed parathyroid hormone-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PTHrP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, PTHrP production was not detected in the culture supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The established cell line, BALM-16, could provide a useful material for analyzing the lack of Ig expression and of clarifying the pathogenesis of this type of B cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
