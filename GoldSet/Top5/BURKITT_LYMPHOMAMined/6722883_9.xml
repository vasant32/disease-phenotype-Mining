<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that H-Y antigen secreted by cells of the Sertoli lineage is bound by receptors on these and other cells of the primordial gonad and thereby initiates formation of the testicular cords, and that H-Y is not an integral transmembrane component but a part of a ternary system with beta 2-microglobulin and products of the MHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It follows that cultured Daudi cells, which lack beta 2-microglobulin and HLA, should secrete H-Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with evidence obtained with monoclonal H-Y antibody and an ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By this method, free H-Y was demonstrable in the supernatant fluids of cultured Sertoli cells and Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay provides a useful alternative to detection of H-Y in the complement-dependent cytotoxicity test </plain></SENT>
