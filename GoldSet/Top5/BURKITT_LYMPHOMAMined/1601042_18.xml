<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Back-to-back fusion products of the respective recombination signal sequences (signal joints) are retained on the chromosome after the formation of a V kappa-J kappa coding joint by an inversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge of the structure of the human kappa locus and the application of the polymerase chain reaction allowed us now to establish a direct relationship between different kappa recombination products in the lymphoid cell line JI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two consecutive inversions fully explain the existence of two coding joints and two signal joints on the same chromosome of this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the initially formed coding joint is productively rearranged and expressed, a second V kappa-J kappa rearrangement took place which leads to an aberrant joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this process a J kappa gene segment of the signal joint that had been created in the first V kappa-J kappa joining was used as the recombination target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence of the two rearrangements is unequivocal since a product of the first (productive) reaction is a partner in the second (aberrant) one </plain></SENT>
