<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the mechanisms that control the downregulation of the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> during differentiation of HL60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi>, HL60 cells downmodulated their steady-state c-myc message levels, ceased to proliferate, and underwent terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nuclear run-on assays in which distinct segments of the c-myc gene were used as probes, an increased blocking to elongation of nascent c-myc transcripts was shown during the early phase of differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a later phase, however, a loss of transcriptional initiation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This loss of promoter activity correlated well with dramatic changes in the chromatin structure of the c-myc gene, as determined by DNase I-hypersensitive site analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, two hypersensitive sites near the two major c-myc promoters disappeared at the time that promotion abated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The newly described, later-acting negative transcriptional control of c-myc also correlated temporally with the inability to reverse the downregulation of the c-myc message quickly on withdrawal of the differentiating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a terminal step during differentiation may be linked to the later-acting mode of transcriptional regulation of c-myc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evidence presented in this report has implications for <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, in which the germ line, nontranslocated c-myc allele is transcriptionally silent </plain></SENT>
