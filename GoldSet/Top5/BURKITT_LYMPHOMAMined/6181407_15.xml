<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a panel of 21 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and other cell lines, mainly of epithelial origin, for the expression of HLA-ABC antigens by an indirect radiobinding assay using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of the lines, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinomas</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> cell lin (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-157), and a colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (LoVo) showed no detectable reaction with the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of binding in another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> line (SkBr3) and a colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> line (LS174T) were much reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cell lines plus some of the HLA-ABC positive lines from the panel were studied by immunoprecipitation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi>-labeled cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms for alteration of the HLA-ABC antigen levels at the cell surface were apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinomas</z:hpo> and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> line, beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2m) was expressed but little or no HLA-A, B, or C <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other HLA-ABC negative lines had defects similar to that in the previously reported Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell line DAUDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these lines, HLA-ABC <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> were produced but did not appear at the cell surface because beta 2m was not synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of HLA-ABC determinants from the cell surface is presumed to afford protection against T-cell immune attack whether naturally as against the trophoblast during pregnancy or in abnormal situations against certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
