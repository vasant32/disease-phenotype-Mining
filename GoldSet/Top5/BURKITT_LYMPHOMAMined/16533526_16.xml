<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Germline mutations in PTPN11 were first observed in Noonan syndrome, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> were identified in hematological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, PTPN11 mutations have been reported in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of mutations in PTPN11, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and FLT3 in samples from 95 Japanese children with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed exon 3 and 8 missense mutations of PTPN11 in 6 children with B precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> and ALL had PTPN11 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also identified <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> mutations in ten patients and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had simultaneous mutations in PTPN11 and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>, while one patient had both PTPN11 and FLT3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PTPN11 mutation may play an important role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> in a proportion of children with ALL, particularly B precursor ALL </plain></SENT>
