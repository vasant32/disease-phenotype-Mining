<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique is described which allows the antibodies of circulating immune complexes to be isolated as their F(ab')2 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method is based on the precipitation of the complexes by the sequential addition of conglutinin and anti-conglutinin, and the subsequent digestion of these precipitates by pepsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using this technique it has been possible to show antibodies to Epstein-Barr (EB) virus antigens in the immune complexes of patients with Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and to microbial antigens in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By substituting DNAase for pepsin it has also been possible to show antibodies to DNA-containing nuclear antigens in the serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
