<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The library was screened by two synthetic oligonucleotides, one specific for IFN-alpha and one complementary to both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rescreening the library with two full-length cDNAs encoding IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, respectively, revealed that the frequency of the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta clones reflected the activities of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta obtained by functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the cDNA level, the dominating species was identical with the type of IFN-alpha A or IFN-alpha 2; however, one new type of cDNA also was found that was similar to the previously described IFN-alpha C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one type of cDNA was found encoding IFN-beta, although several IFN-beta proteins have been detected in the analyzed cell line </plain></SENT>
