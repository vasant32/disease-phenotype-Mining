<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> disease is continuously rising worldwide as far as its incidence is concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts were made in order to identify the etiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A good example for exogenous factors is Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which is largely spread worldwide, over 90% of the adult general population being infected by it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV is believed to be implicated in Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we will try to present the experience of two centers in Cluj County involved in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric cancer</z:e>, focusing on the influence of the presence of Epstein Barr virus in the outcome of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: we took into account the clinical data regarding histology, stage of the disease, titer of specific antibodies for EBV, serological and imagistic evaluations of the patients treated in a retrospective consecutive manner for 5 years--2005-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding our cohort of 120 patients, we analyzed the items in the paper in detail together with the statistical analysis and searched for a link between the intensity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of EBV and response, disease, free survival, toxicities of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: there are few data concerning the influence of EBV regarding the outcome of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The published studies suggest a positive influence of EBV especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> mixed cellular subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study, EBV negative patients do better than the EBV positive, but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with EBV protects the patients against hematological toxicities </plain></SENT>
