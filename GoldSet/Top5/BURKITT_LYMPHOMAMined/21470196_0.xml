<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we demonstrate that OSU-DY7, a novel D-tyrosinol derivative targeting p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mediates cytotoxicity in lymphocytic cell lines representing CLL (MEC-1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (697 cells), Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (Raji and Ramos) and primary B cells from CLL patients in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is dependent on caspase activation, as evidenced by induction of caspase-3 activation and poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and rescue of cytotoxicity by Z-VAD-FMK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is mediated through activation of p38 MAPK, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and downstream target protein MAPKAPK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of B-CLL cells with SB202190, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, results in decreased MAPKAPK2 protein level with concomitant rescue of the cells from OSU-DY7-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OSU-DY7-induced cytotoxicity is associated with down regulation of p38 MAPK target BIRC5, that is rescued at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels by SB202190 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence for a role of OSU-DY7 in p38 MAPK activation and BIRC5 down regulation associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in B lymphocytic cells, thus warranting development of this alternative therapy for lymphoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
