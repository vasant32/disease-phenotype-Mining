<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a quantitative scheme for full-field polarization rotating fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A quarter-wave plate, in combination with a liquid crystal variable retarder, provides a tunable method to rotate polarization states of light prior to its being coupled into a fluorescence microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A calibration of the polarization properties of the incident light is performed in order to correct for elliptical polarization states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This calibration allows the response of the sample to linear polarization states of light to be recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three known polarization states of light can be used to determine the average fluorescent dipole orientations in the presence of a spatially varying dc offset or background polarization-invariant fluorescence signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the capabilities of this device, we measured a series of full-field fluorescence polarization images from fluorescent analogs incorporated in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membrane of Burkitts <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> CA46 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-like analogs used in this study are molecules that are labeled by either a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi> (1,1(')-Dioctadecyl 3,3,3('),3(')-Tetramethylindocarbocyanine) fluorophore in its head group or a Bodipy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51107">4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene</z:chebi>) molecule in its acyl chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A spatially varying contrast in the normalized amplitude was observed on the cell surface, where the orientation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52029">DiI</z:chebi> molecules is tangential to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The internally labeled cellular structures showed zero response to changes in linear polarization, and the net linear polarization amplitude for these regions was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This instrument provides a low cost calibrated method that may be coupled to existing fluorescence microscopes to perform investigations of cellular processes that involve a change in molecular orientations </plain></SENT>
