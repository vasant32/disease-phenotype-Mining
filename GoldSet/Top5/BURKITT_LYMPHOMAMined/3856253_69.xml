<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>c-myc gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is reduced by greater than 75% in the human lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi when growth is inhibited by treatment with human interferon beta (IFN-beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present communication, we describe the effect of IFN-beta treatment on transcription of the c-myc gene and on the steady-state level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cytoplasm of Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that, although the rate of c-myc transcription is not significantly different in nuclei isolated either from untreated cells or from those treated with IFN-beta for 3 or 24 hr, the level of c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cytoplasm is reduced by 60% within 3 hr of IFN-beta treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IFN-beta regulates the c-myc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at a post-transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are in contrast to the regulation of two IFN-beta-induced genes that under identical conditions are regulated in these cells at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also detected induction of the (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) gene in IFN-beta-treated Daudi cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since certain c-myc transcripts have the capacity to form double-stranded <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> regions, we propose that one mechanism by which c-myc could be regulated post-transcriptionally in IFN-beta-treated cells is by activating, through its own double-strandedness, the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L endonuclease system, which would cause selective degradation of the c-myc <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
