<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD34 is a 110-kD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> previously shown by a variety of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to be expressed selectively on immature hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, more detailed characterization of CD34+ cells has been hampered by lack of anti-CD34 MoAbs that can be labelled directly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51217">fluorochromes</z:chebi> to facilitate subpopulation analysis by multi-parameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently isolated a murine anti-CD34 MoAb, designated as 8G12, that can be directly labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51217">fluorochromes</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have exploited this property of 8G12 to compare the reactivity of 8G12 and My10 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukaemic human marrow cells and to characterize <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> early human B cell precursors by two- and three-colour immunofluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of three-colour staining profiles of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells incubated with both 8G12 and MY10, and either anti-CD10 or anti-CD19 MoAb revealed the reactivity patterns of 8G12 and MY10 to be indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was confirmed by a similar comparative analysis of 8G12 and MY10 staining of blood and bone marrow cells from 4 patients with B lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of interest, both 8G12 and MY10 detected a CD34+CD10+CD19- population in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a CD34+CD10+CD19- precursor population previously reported by others to exist in fetal liver could also be identified, CD10+CD16- marrow cells were first isolated by FACS and the sorted cells then re-analysed for expression of CD19 and CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the sorted CD10+ cells that expressed CD34 appeared to coexpress CD19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No CD34+CD10+CD19- cells were detected (at a sensitivity of less than or equal to 0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be required to determine whether a very minor population of CD34+CD10+CD19- cells may still be generated in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of B cells in adult human marrow </plain></SENT>
