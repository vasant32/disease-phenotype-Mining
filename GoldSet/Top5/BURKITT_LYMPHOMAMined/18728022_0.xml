<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions in 9p are seen in about 9% of cases of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, but their prognostic impact has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic data from 381 patients diagnosed with B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal analysis was successful in 240 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these cases, 18 (8%) had abnormalities in 9p and they were compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes and patients with t(9;22)/BCR-ABL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 9 showed significantly shorter overall survival compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, overall survival was similar to that in the poor prognosis t(9;22)/BCR-ABL-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that chromosomal abnormalities involving 9p may have a significant negative impact on survival in adult B-precursor <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
