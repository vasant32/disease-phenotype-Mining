<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the microRNA miR-146a is an important regulator of immunological processes and contributes to the pathogenesis of certain B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> types, in B cells the epigenetic regulation of miR-146a expresion has not been studied yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms controlling miR-146a expression in B lymphoid cells we analysed epigenetic marks, including CpG methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications, at the miR-146a promoter in well characterized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and EBV negative B cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, EBV positive epithelial cell lines were also studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cells with a silent miR-146a promoter the 5' regulatory sequences comprising a CpG island were devoid of activating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications, independently of the methylation pattern of the regulatory region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regulatory sequences flanking the inactive miR-146 promoter were hypermethylated at CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the EBV positive Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) cell lines of memory B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> (Rael and Akata), partially methylated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp> cell lines C2G6 and C4A3, and completely unmethylated in the nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line C666-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in EBV positive cell lines of activated B <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp>, and EBV negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cell lines the invariably unmethylated 5' regulatory sequences of active miR-146a promoters were enriched in the euchromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification marks acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3, acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 dimethylated at lysine 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The euchromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification marks extended over the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional initiation site to the 3' intron, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that similarly to the promoters of protein coding genes, both DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications contribute to the host cell dependent expression of miR-146a </plain></SENT>
