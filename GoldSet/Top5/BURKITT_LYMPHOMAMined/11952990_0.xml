<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) play important roles in the host immune defence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to identify roles of PMNs other than those already known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: PMNs were separated from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and stored in vitro for 24 h in the presence or absence of an anti-human Fc receptor (FcR) gamma III antibody, namely, anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody (mAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stored supernatants were harvested and incubated with several <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and transformed cell lines for 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in growth rate was assessed by the increase in the amount of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporated into these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of perforin on PMNs, which is thought to decrease cell viability, was elucidated by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of perforin in the stored supernatants was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>, which is known to block the effect of perforin, was added to the cultures of several <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and transformed cell lines to confirm the effect of perforin in reducing cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Growth promotion of some cell lines cultured with the stored supernatants of PMNs was observed both in the presence and absence of anti-CD16 mAb, which was used as a trigger molecule of PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was particularly notable in the case of Raji and Daudi (both Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) derived from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perforin expression was observed in both freshly prepared and stored PMNs, regardless of the presence or absence of anti-CD16 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ELISA also detected perforin in the stored supernatants in both the presence and absence of anti-CD16 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The increase in growth rate was induced in the presence of not only a serine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> but also an anti-perforin mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stored supernatants of PMNs exhibit up-regulation of cell growth in several cell lines; this up-regulation is particularly prominent in B-lineage cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, perforin appeared to be expressed on PMNs constitutively and secreted into the extracellular fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Results of this study strongly suggest that the growth-promoting activity in supernatants of stored PMNs is partially inhibited by perforin, which is thought to be produced by PMNs themselves </plain></SENT>
