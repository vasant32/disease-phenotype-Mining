<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a method for quantitating closely related <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> by S1 mapping and used it to determine the levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and various alpha IFNs (IFN-alpha 1, -alpha 2, -alpha 4, -alpha 5, -alpha 6, -alpha 7, -alpha 8 and -alpha 14) in human peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphoblastoid (Namalwa), HeLa and human fibroblastic cells, induced in different fashions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ratio of alpha to beta IFN transcripts varied greatly, depending on the cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of the individual IFN-alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were very different: IFN-alpha 1, -alpha 2 and -alpha 4 RNAs constituted the major fraction of the IFN-alpha transcripts measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a striking difference in the proportion of individual IFN-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> species in different cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of different induction protocols did not significantly affect the proportion of IFN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN production was not proportional to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, as lymphoblastoid cells induced by incubation at high density and virus-induced HeLa cells contained high levels of IFN-beta but produced little antiviral activity </plain></SENT>
