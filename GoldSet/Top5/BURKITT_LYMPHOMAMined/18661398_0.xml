<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, cell growth inhibition on human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines CA46 and Raji were obtained with either srhCD40L or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, whereas converse effects on CD40 negative control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, S phase arrest was demonstrated on CA46 cells in the presence of srhCD40L, and also cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> following exposed to srhCD40L or PDTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity of CA46 cell extracts was markedly suppressed with srhCD40L or PDTC by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing activity of srhCD40L via CD40-CD40 ligand interaction on Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells was confirmed, and these effects may be attributable to the suppression of NF-kappaB binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, srhCD40L may provide clinical benefits in the treatment of CD40 positive <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> including human Burkitt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
