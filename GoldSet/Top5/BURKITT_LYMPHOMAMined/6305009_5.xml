<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible role of DNA methylation in determining the producer and nonproducer status of EBV-carrying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines and whether this pattern would be affected by treatment with inducers, like <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17968">n-butyrate</z:chebi>, which effectively activate the productive virus cycle in low-level producer lines, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By studying intracellular EBV DNA present in total cellular DNA isolates it was concluded that (i) intracellular EBV DNA is methylated in and around the EcoRI-J fragment in both producer and nonproducer cell lines; (ii) methylation at this site is more pronounced in nonproducer cell lines as compared with producer cell lines; (iii) the cell lines studied here responded differently to chemical induction as determined by EBV-specific antigen immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no major differences in the methylation pattern in and around the EcoRI-J fragment could be observed before and after induction </plain></SENT>
