<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although various molecular mechanisms of STAT protein (signal transducers and activators of transcription) activation have been identified, little is known about the functional role of STAT-dependent transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we report the constitutive nuclear localization, phosphorylation, and DNA-binding activity of STAT proteins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the use of oligonucleotide probes derived from the Fc gamma RI promoter, the beta-casein promoter and a STAT-binding element in the promoter of the Bci-2 gene constitutive activation of STAT proteins was detected in untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T- and C/B-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells (3 of 5 and 12 of 19 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supershift analyses using Stats 1-6 specific antisera showed the constitutive DNA binding activity of Stat5 in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy revealed the nuclear localization of Stat5 and Western blot analyses showed tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 in nuclear extracts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not display constitutive STAT-DNA interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies were performed on freshly isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cells as well as on cell line derived K562, lymphoblastoid cells (LCL), and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy, gelshift, and supershift experiments showed the nuclear localization and constitutive DNA-binding activity of Stat5 in K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stat1 and Stat3 were constitutively activated in freshly isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cells (10 of 14 patients) and in Epstein Barr virus-positive or interleukin-10 expressing permanent LCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, these data indicate a differential pattern of STAT protein activation in lymphoid or myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
