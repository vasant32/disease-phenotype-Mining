<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This promoter DNA segment (termed BiP670) or one of its 5' deletion derivatives was fused to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> acetyltransferase gene and introduced into HeLa cells for transient expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BiP670 retained transcriptional activity at both the basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> A23187-inducible levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant increase in promoter activity following a 5 h induction with 7 microM-A23187, and less than 5-fold induction at 15 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the steady-state <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was induced by 18-fold at 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vivo transactivation assays with BiP670 5' deletion derivatives indicate that the putative A23187-inducible element is located within a 70 bp DNA segment (i.e. spanning -39 to -107 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an in vitro gel mobility shift assay, A23187-inducible nuclear factors were identified from HeLa cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA-binding competition experiments also suggest that the 70 bp DNA segment contains a potential sequence motif for the binding of the A23187-inducible nuclear factors </plain></SENT>
