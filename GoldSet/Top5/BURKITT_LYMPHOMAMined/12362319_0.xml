<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The vector containing bcl-2 gene as standard template was constructed with T-A cloning technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fluorogenic probe (i.e.,Taq man probe) was used to establish a real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>bcl-2 mRNA expression level in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> pre-and post-treated with bcl-2 antisense phosphothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-PS-ODN) was determined with real-time quantitative RT-PCR, also with semi-quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression of bcl-2 mRNA in Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> treated with bcl-2 AS- PS-ODN decreased significantly and no changes of bcl-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in group treated with nonsense ODN were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results also demonstrated that bcl-2 level varied as detected with real-time fluorogenic quantitative RT-PCR, but less sensitive and accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detection of bcl-2 mRNA expression with the fluorogenic real-time quantitative RT-PCR is more accurate and sensitive than semi-quantitive RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
