<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that follicular exclusion requires a threshold level of antigen receptor engagement combined with occupancy of follicles by B cells without equivalent receptor engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The possibility has been raised that follicular composition affects B cell positioning by altering the amount of available antigen and the degree of receptor occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that follicular composition affects migration of mature B cells under conditions that are independent of antigen receptor occupancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>B cells deficient in the negative regulatory protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP1, which have elevated intracellular signaling by the B cell receptor, are shown to accumulate in the T zone in the absence of their specific antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicular exclusion of SHP1-deficient B cells was found to be conditional on the presence of excess B cells that lack elevated intracellular signaling, and was not due to a failure of SHP-1-deficient cells to mature and express the follicle-homing chemokine receptor Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> receptor 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that signals that are negatively regulated by SHP1 promote B cell localization in T cell zones by reducing competitiveness for follicular entry, and provide further evidence that follicular composition influences the positioning of antigen-engaged B cells </plain></SENT>
