<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stimulated cells were most probably of T-cell origin, although at the peak of stimulation many of them lacked the sheep erythrocyte marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct effector-target cell contact was necessary for lysis to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of autologously stimulated (AS) lymphocytes was not restricted to EBV-genome-positive LCLs, nor to cell lines of hematopoietic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was equally broad if cells carrying complement receptor had been removed before stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fresh lymphocytes, blasts induced by phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A, and Burkitt's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> biopsy cells were resistant or considerably less sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse cells--even cell lines--were resistant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of target cells to lysis correlated positively with their capacity to block AS lymphocyte lysis of autologous LCLs in competition experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity of AS lymphocytes was blocked by EBV-genome-positive and -negative cell lines, whereas the EBV-related cytotoxicity of T cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> was blocked by EBV-genome-positive LCL only </plain></SENT>
