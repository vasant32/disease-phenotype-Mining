<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have described the factor XIII A subunit (FXIII-A) Val34Leu polymorphism as a protective factor against venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the FXIII-A Val34Leu polymorphism, its interaction with fibrinogen concentration, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 172 consecutive patients with aPL: 88 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), 38 with APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (APS-SLE), 32 with SLE and aPL but without APS (SLE-aPL), and 14 asymptomatic individuals with aPL (A-aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FXIII-A Val34Leu polymorphism was assessed by polymerase chain reaction techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences in FXIII-A Leu34 allele frequencies between primary APS (allele frequency 0.22), APS-SLE (0.23), SLE-aPL (0.22) and A-aPL (0.32) patients, or between patients with (0.21) and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FXIII-A Leu34 allele frequencies were significantly lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and those in the upper fibrinogen tertile (&gt;3.40 g/l) (allele frequency 0.07) compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the upper fibrinogen tertile (0.29) and patients with (0.29) and without (0.25) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the mid- and lower fibrinogen tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FXIII-A Leu34 allele had a protective effect against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients in the upper fibrinogen tertile (odds ratio [OR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.60) but not in those in the other tertiles (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.67-2.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FXIII-A Leu34 allele seems to have a protective effect on the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with aPL, but only in those with high plasma fibrinogen values </plain></SENT>
