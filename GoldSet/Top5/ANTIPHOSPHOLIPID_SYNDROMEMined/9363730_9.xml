<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an in-vitro placental culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological dose of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (20 IU/ml) significantly (P &lt; 0.02) reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) binding in the ELISA and was able to restore GnRH-induced HCG secretion (P &lt; 0.05) in presence of aPL-containing sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low-dose aspirin (0.03 M) did not modify aPL binding in the ELISA, but partially restored HCG secretion (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations may help to explain the role of these treatments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
