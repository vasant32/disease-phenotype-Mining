<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To examine the possible relationship between anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) and pediatric rheumatologic diseases, we investigated the presence of ACA (using enzyme immunoassay) in the sera of 45 children and adolescents with such diseases and compared the results with a group of 42 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACA were present ( &gt; or =10 U/ml) in three out of five patients (60%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (SCD), in seven out of 16 (43.8%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), in two out of five patients (40%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>), in one out of four patients (25%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e>), and in two out of 14 patients (14.3%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACA were also detected in a single patient with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APL) who had digital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, as well as in two healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACA positivity was related to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> in the studied sample, as 86% of patients suffering from the phenomenon were ACA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACA positivity was associated with older age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>high erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo> (ESR) values, and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and weight and height percentile values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also higher among anti-nuclear antibody-positive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> and ACA positivity shared almost the same clinical and laboratory associations in the studied patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ACA are probably among the markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> in pediatric rheumatologic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their value as predictors of future development of the phenomenon needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
