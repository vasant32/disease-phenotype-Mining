<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The study evaluated the systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and endothelium-dependent and independent function of the brachial artery (BA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 42 women with SLE (21 without APS; mean age 36.1 ± 9.1, and 21 with APS; mean age 43.9 ± 13.1) and 22 healthy controls (mean age 43.5 ± 10.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-dependent functional response was evacuate using the flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery and endothelium-independent vasodilatation by application of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using biochemical methods, circulating inflammatory markers were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison to controls, in both groups of patients endothelium-dependent dilation of BA was significantly reduced, and there were no differences in FMD between patients with or without APS: SLE - 7.7% (11.9-12.1), SLE+APS 7.8% (2.4-12.8), controls - 14.6% (11.2-21.1), p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, endothelium-independent dilation of the brachial artery was significantly lower in SLE-APS patients than in controls and also lower than in the SLE group: SLE - 24.3% (15.0-28.6), SLE+APS-17.4% (13.1-22.6), controls - 23.0% (17.8-30.1), p=0.015 vs. p=0.027 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SLE had significantly higher values of VCAM-1, hs-CRP, and fibrinogen than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with SLE+APS, an additional significant increase of inflammatory markers was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that patients with SLE have deteriorated endothelium-dependent and those with APS also independent vascular function which could be, together with <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory response</z:mp>, involved in vascular complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of APS aggravates systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
