<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether interaction between autoantibodies and endothelium leads to an impaired <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> response has not been investigated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to investigate the endothelial functions in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients with PAPS (22 female, nine male, mean age: 34.6+/-8.9 years) and 27 age- and sex-matched, healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brachial artery responses to reactive hyperaemia (endothelium-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>) [EDD] and sublingual <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> (endothelium-independent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>) [EID] were measured by using high-resolution vascular ultrasound both in patients with PAPS and in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were expressed as percentage of change in baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, there was no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EDD in patients with PAPS was significantly lower than those of controls (6.9+/-4.9 vs. 14.8+/-4.1%; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EID measurements were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the PAPS group, EDD in patients with arterial involvement (17 patients) was significantly lower than those of patients with venous involvement (12 patients) (4.6+/-3.9 vs. 7.4+/-4.1%; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study showed that endothelial functions determined by using brachial artery ultrasound were impaired in patients with PAPS, and this was more prominent in the subgroup of patients with arterial involvement compared to patients with venous involvement </plain></SENT>
