<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> who had three or more repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was used for each of the first pregnancies after referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in antibody status were investigated with relation to outcomes of the index and subsequent pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of 23 pregnancies in 36 antibody-positive women treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resulted in term or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> with live-born infants, and five ended in abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies cleared in ten of 12 term pregnancies, in five of six preterm pregnancies, and in one of five abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference between the term pregnancy and abortion groups (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven second and third pregnancies in nine women in whom antibodies cleared resulted in term or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> of live-born infants, without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second and third pregnancies in one woman whose antibodies persisted ended in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> despite repeated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> cleared spontaneously in some pregnant women treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsequent pregnancies among women in whom antibodies cleared were managed successfully without medication, whereas pregnancies in women with persistent antibodies required treatment </plain></SENT>
