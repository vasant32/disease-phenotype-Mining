<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients and 15 controls were followed in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had SLE (group I) and 15 had APS (group II, of which seven patients had primary APS and eight had APS secondary to SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were receiving therapy for the prevention of fetal loss with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and aspirin as part of an ongoing clinical trial in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> pregnancy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters (T) of pregnancy in order to assess the presence of IgG and IgM aCL antibodies (ELISA), anti-dsDNA ( C. luciliae) ANAs (HEp-2 cells), and immunospecific antibodies (antiextractable nuclear antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We collected 90 samples from patients and 45 samples from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group I (SLE) ANAs were positive in 100% during the 1st T, 67% in the 2nd T, and 67% in the 3rd T, with various immunofluorescence patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five patients, aCL antibodies were detected without a history of APS (one in 1st T, three in 2nd T, and one in 3rd T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fetal loss was observed in two patients, in one of whom it was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, high titers of ANAs, and anti-dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> with anti-dsDNA and aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group II, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient with primary APS were negative to ANAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In secondary APS, by contrast, 6/8 patients (75%) had positive ANAs at least during the 1st T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients with primary APS and 6/8 with secondary APS had aCL during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 9/15 (60%) patients from the APS group with a history of previous fetal loss, aCL became negative during pregnancy and they had live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The disappearance of aCL was associated with improved fetal survival (relative risk, or RR, 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ANAs in the control group were positive in 7% at low titers, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were negative for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment, ANAs are prevalent during pregnancy in SLE patients and APS secondary to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy in SLE, aCL titers may appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Decreasing titers and/or disappearance of aCL correlated with improved fetal prognosis in a subset of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
