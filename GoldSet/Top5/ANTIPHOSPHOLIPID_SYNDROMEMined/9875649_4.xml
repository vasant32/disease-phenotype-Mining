<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is characterised by arterial and venous thromboses affecting small and large vessels, together with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report two cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> following liver transplantation which resulted in hepatic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and subsequent graft loss, and we discuss the value of anticoagulation in prevention of further thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of these cases prompted a retrospective analysis for the presence of IgG anticardiolipin antibody, the most useful laboratory marker of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum taken at 2 to 4 weeks following transplantation (when thrombotic events might be anticipated) was analysed further in 132 patients undergoing liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hepatic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 21/132 (16%) post transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin IgG was present in 2/21 (8.8%) recipients who developed a hepatic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following liver transplantation, compared to 7/111 (6.3%) (p=0.59) in whom transplantation was not complicated by hepatic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IgG anticardiolipin antibody was uncommon in recipients following liver transplantation and was not associated with an increased risk of hepatic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> which is rare may result in hepatic <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and graft loss, and so prompt recognition of the clinical syndrome is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although screening for the antibody is not warranted in liver transplant recipients, it is important to be aware of the syndrome as optimal management of such cases may prevent graft loss </plain></SENT>
