<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aPL/β(2)GPI complex then exerts pathogenic effects on target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously described periplasmic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> expression of native and mutated variants of DI, and reported the presence of immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> at positions 8-9 (D8/D9) and position 39 (R39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations at these positions strongly influenced the ability of recombinant DI to bind patient-derived IgG aPL and to inhibit pathogenic effects of these aPL in a mouse model of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now describe an improved cytoplasmic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> expression system allowing higher yield of DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of a (15)N,(13)C-isotope-labelled sample of the recombinant DI protein exhibit properties consistent with the structure of DI in crystal structure of intact β(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations at D8/D9 and R39 had limited impact on the NMR spectrum of DI indicating maintenance of the overall fold of the DI domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated interactions between five variants of DI and ten monoclonal human IgG antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> derived from the IgG aPL antibody IS4 by sequence manipulation and in vitro expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">Arginine residues</z:chebi> at positions 100 and 100g in IS4V(H) CDR3 play a particularly important role in binding to DI, but this is unlikely to be due to electrostatic interactions with negatively charged amino acids on DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the strength of binding to DI and the ability to discriminate different DI variants varies between the different IgG antibodies tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no simple relationship between these binding properties and antibody pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
