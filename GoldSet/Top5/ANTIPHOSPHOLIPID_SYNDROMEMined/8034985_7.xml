<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is increasing interest in the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the so-called '<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome' (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two major methods currently employed for detecting the autoantibodies are the solid phase ELISA and the LAI test (inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependent coagulation assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study we have tested the possibility of detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> by immunostaining on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates, since this technique permits the use of pure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> molecules as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera were collected from 20 patients with SLE without APS, 20 patients with APS, 20 anti-HIV positive subjects, ten patients with signs of APS but antiphospholipid negative (ELISA), 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> and 40 matched blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that only 72.3% of sera containing detectable levels of aCL antibodies in solid phase ELISA were also positive for aCL in TLC immunostaining; these discrepancies may be due to the presence of antibodies reacting with a protein complexed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I) or, alternatively, to the different antigenic presentation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> on chromatograms compared to the surface of microtitre wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aCL monoclonal antibody CAL-3, as well as nine sera positive for aCL, also reacted with PS and PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous absorption of these sera with CL micelles completely abolished the reactivity with PS and PE, demonstrating cross-reactivity among these three <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings reveal that TLC immunostaining is more specific, but less sensitive, than ELISA for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in human sera </plain></SENT>
