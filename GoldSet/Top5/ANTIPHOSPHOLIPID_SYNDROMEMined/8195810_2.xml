<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> sera and some selected paired CSF and serum specimens, were also analyzed for the presence of anti-phosphatidylserine (PS) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels of IgG and IgM ACA were synthesized intrathecally only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027927" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurosyphilis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with other infectious or inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> very rarely showed detectable levels of ACA in serum and/or CSF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The search for PS and PE antibodies disclosed that in <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> patients the serum titers of these antibodies mirrored ACA IgG and IgM titers, while they were never found in the CSF </plain></SENT>
