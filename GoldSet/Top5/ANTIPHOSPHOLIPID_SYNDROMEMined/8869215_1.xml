<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with two types of human endothelial cells as the substrate, i.e., human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or the hybrid cell line EAhy-926 obtained by fusion of HUVECs with the bronchial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cell line A549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparative functional study of these two cell types demonstrated that EAhy-926 cells produced only small amounts of VIII <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor and tissular factor, did not contain Weibel Palade bodies visible under the electron microscope, and expressed ICAM-1 and selectin E in levels of no more than 15% of those expressed by human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells both after stimulation by <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> and under basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the two assay methods yielded similar IgG AECA titers when used on sera from patients with rheumatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These antibodies did not exhibit cytotoxicity for cord vein or EAhy-926 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were not specific for endothelium, since their activity decreased by a mean of 40% after incubation of sera with the epithelial cell line A549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study of 565 sera demonstrated that anti-vascular IgG and IgM AECAs reactive with EAhy-926 cells occurred mainly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (IgG, 58%; IgM, 22%), systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (IgG, 48%; IgM, 18%), primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (IgG, 44%; IgM, 12%) and secondary and primary systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> (IgG, 38%; IgM, 18%) including Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal study in patients with Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> showed that AECAS were predictive of disease activity </plain></SENT>
