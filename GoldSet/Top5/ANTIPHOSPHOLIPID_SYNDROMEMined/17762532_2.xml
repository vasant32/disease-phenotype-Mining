<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested this hypothesis by comparing TFPI activity and the frequency of common TFPI polymorphisms, -33T-&gt;C, -399C-&gt;T and -287T-&gt;C, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (n = 24) or factor V Leiden (n = 44) who had a history of VTE (n = 26), compared with those without VTE (n = 42) and also with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individuals (n = 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TFPI activity was measured using a modified amidolytic assay and genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that only APS patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> had TFPI activity levels significantly different from control individuals (1.77 +/- 0.60 vs 0.77 +/- 0.19 U/ml; P = 0.0001), and this was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the TFPI -33C allele (1.70 +/- 0.72 U/ml for TC/CC genotypes vs 0.97 +/- 0.56 U/ml for TT; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of APS and factor V Leiden patients revealed that the greatest independent contributor to VTE was TFPI activity (adjusted odds ratio = 16.84; 95% confidence interval = 2.47-114.36, P = 0.004), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of either the TFPI -33C or -399T alleles each increased the odds of VTE by nearly 13 times (95% confidence interval = 2.39-69.91, P = 0.003; and 95% confidence interval = 2.25-71.23, P = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the TFPI -33T-&gt;C and -399C-&gt;T polymorphisms are significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the presence of other risk factors, especially APS, and may be clinically relevant in patients who are prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
