<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts in monocytic cells and to evaluate the proinflammatory and procoagulant effects of anti-beta(2)GPI binding to its target antigen on the monocyte plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human monocytes were fractionated by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density-gradient centrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to analyze the association of beta(2)GPI with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts and the possible interaction of beta(2)GPI with annexin A2 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monocytes were then stimulated with affinity-purified anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation were evaluated by immunoprecipitation and transcription factor assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from monocytes were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) and tissue factor (TF) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found beta(2)GPI and its putative receptor annexin A2 in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> raft fractions of human monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was an association between beta(2)GPI and TLR-4, suggesting that it was partially dependent on raft integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Triggering with anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies induced IRAK phosphorylation and consequent NF-kappaB activation, which led to the release of TNFalpha and TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies react with their target antigen, likely in association with annexin A2 and TLR-4, in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> rafts in the monocyte plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI binding triggers IRAK phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation, leading to a proinflammatory and procoagulant monocyte phenotype characterized by the release of TNFalpha and TF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of APS, improving our knowledge of valuable therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
