<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, two MAIPA (Monoclonal Antibody (MAb) Immobilization of Platelet Antigen) assays (MAIPA I and MAIPA II) were performed on sera from thrombocytopenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the classic MAIPA assay (MAIPA I), control platelets were incubated simultaneously with human serum and a mouse MAb to a platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MAIPA II, the control platelets were incubated first with the human serum and then, after washing, with the selected mouse MAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive MAIPA I test but a negative MAIPA II has been shown to result from the presence of serum antibodies recognizing mouse MAb to platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> used in the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of such 'anti-mouse' antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated or not with other autoimmune states and in healthy donors with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of anti-mouse antibodies between patients and healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the identity of the targeted mouse MAbs varied in sera from the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detected anti-mouse antibodies may include anti-idiotypic antibodies produced against cross-reactive idiotypes shared by human and mouse anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
