<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We evaluated the prevalence and progression of Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and any association between this valvulopathy and their clinical and laboratory characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doppler echocardiography was performed in 342 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (297 females and 45 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were reevaluated after a follow-up period of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> was found in 38 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 24 of 38 patients, mitral valve involvement was found, resulting in regurgitation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (mild in 18, moderate in 4, and severe in 2), whereas stenosis co-occurred with regurgitation in 9 patients (mild in 6 and moderate in 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (34%) of 38 patients had aortic valve involvement; 11 had regurgitation (mild) and 8 had stenosis (mild), coexistent with regurgitation in 6 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and disease duration and activity, thromboses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, anticardiolipin antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 252 of 342 patients were reevaluated echocardiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients with Libman-Sacks vegetations, 5 with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> at the beginning developed moderate (n=4) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (n=1), 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> (mild in 1 and moderate in 1) developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, and 2 patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> developed moderate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, whereas a significant deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients who were candidates for surgery died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 213 patients without vegetations at the beginning, 8 developed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011714'>Libman-Sacks lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Libman-Sacks vegetations can be found in approximately 1 of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and they are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> duration, disease activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A progression of valve lesions may occur during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
