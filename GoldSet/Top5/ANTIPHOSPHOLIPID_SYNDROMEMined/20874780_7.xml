<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We have shown that prolongation of clotting time by anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) antibodies correlates better with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than a positive classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) assay in a single center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To confirm or falsify this finding we have conducted a multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 325 LAC-positive samples, we found that the beta2GPI-dependent LAC correlated 2.0 times better with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than the classic LAC assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although significant, this was a minimal improvement compared with the 'classic' LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was published that calcium influences the behavior of anti-beta2GPI antibodies in coagulation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether calcium plays a role in the present study, we divided the patient population into two groups: (i) blood was collected in 0.109 m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> and (ii) blood was drawn in 0.129 m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that a positive result with the beta2GPI-dependent LAC assay correlated better with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> [odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-5.8] when 0.109 m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> was used compared with 0.129 m <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> (OR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We were able to confirm in an international multicenter study that a positive result in a beta2GPI-dependent LAC assay correlates better with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than the classic LAC assay, but that the assay needs further study as it is sensitive to external factors such as the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium citrate</z:chebi> concentration used as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in the test sample </plain></SENT>
