<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the enormous amount of work focused on the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the Hughes or anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), there is little published on management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, the diagnosis of APS is made after the first thrombotic event, when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screen is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients have a high risk of recurrent thromboses and current therapy centres on the use of thromboprophylaxis with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>However, a number of clinical questions keep recurring: do arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> require the same intensity of anti-coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>When should <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> be stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>Should patients who develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when other risk factors (oral contraceptive pill, prolonged resting etc.) are present be treated like those without any risk factors but the presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>How to manage a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> despite a high intensity anti-coagulation (International normalized ratio (INR) between 3.0-4.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since many of the patients with aPL are fertile women, a substantial group of patients are diagnosed after recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-dose aspirin for those patients without previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for patients with a history of thrombotic events are the current therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="?"><plain>However, some questions remain unanswered: does the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> to low-dose aspirin in women with first trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> but without previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> improve foetal outcome over and above aspirin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="?"><plain>Which is the best therapeutic regime during pregnancy for patients with aPL-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="?"><plain>When should high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, very little is known about the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in individuals positive for aPL but still free of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="?"><plain>Should these individuals receive any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="?"><plain>If so, which one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this review we attempt to address some of these questions taking into account available data from retrospective and prospective studies and our own clinical experience </plain></SENT>
