<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicenter study, 502 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) patients awaiting renal transplants were screened to determine the frequency of APAS, the potential risk associated with APAS, and strategies for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients (19%) had high titers of ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had documented evidence of one or more of the thrombotic disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, frequent abortions, frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of arteriovenous shunts, biopsy-proven microrenal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and thus were diagnosed with APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 23 patients, 11 received kidney transplants either with (4 patients) or without (7 patients), concomitant anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven of the patients with APAS not treated with anticoagulation therapy lost their allografts within 1 week as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, three out of four transplant patients with APAS treated with anticoagulation therapy maintained their allografts for over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient lost his graft within a week because of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 70 patients with high titers of ACA but no evidence of thrombotic disorders, 37 received kidney transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None lost their allografts as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that, although 19% of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients exhibit high titer of ACA, only 5% of the patients have APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that the patients with APAS are at high risk of posttransplant <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy could prevent patients from posttransplant <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APAS </plain></SENT>
