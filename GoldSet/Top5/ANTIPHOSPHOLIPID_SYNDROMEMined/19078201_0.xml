<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL include the false-positive serologic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and the anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A distinct clinical syndrome has been associated with these antibodies, the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome," which is characterized by the triad of recurrent venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and recur-rent fetal loss, as well as a number of other organ system manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the recognition of newer clinical manifestations of this syndrome, understanding of the basic immunology and pathophysiology has changed dramatically during the last several years: antiphospholipid anti-bodies are now known to recognize two or more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins rather than pure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, potentially explaining the diversity in clinical presentations and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current therapies are based on long-term anticoagulation for prevention of recurrent thromboses and a combination of low dose aspirin with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discovery of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins as antibody <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> sites may lead to novel therapies in the near future </plain></SENT>
