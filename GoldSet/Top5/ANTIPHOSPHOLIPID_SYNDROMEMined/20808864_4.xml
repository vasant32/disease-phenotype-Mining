<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) of IgA isotype remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this issue, we reasoned that if IgA aPL contribute to the clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, then an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> should manifest in patients whose only aPL is of IgA isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective chart review of 56 patients (31 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> [SLE] and 25 without SLE) whose only positive aPL was IgA anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (isolated IgA anti-beta2GPI) and compared their clinical features with 56 individually matched control patients without any aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with isolated IgA anti-beta2GPI had a significantly increased number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When patients were stratified into those with and without SLE, the association between isolated IgA anti-beta2GPI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> persisted for patients with SLE, but was lost for those without SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Titers of IgA anti-beta2GPI were significantly higher in SLE patients who suffered a thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with isolated IgA anti-beta2GPI, there was an increased prevalence of diseases or morbidities involving organs of mucosal immunity (i.e., gastrointestinal system, pulmonary system, and skin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of isolated IgA anti-beta2GPI is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, especially among patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-beta2GPI is associated with an increased prevalence of morbidities involving organs of mucosal immunity </plain></SENT>
