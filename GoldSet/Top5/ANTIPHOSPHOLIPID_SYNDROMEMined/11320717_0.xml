<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 100/120 mm, C-reactive protein 1.5 mg/dl, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> 2.45 mg/dl, urinary protein 0.8 g/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) against neutrophil granulocytes and for native DNA antibodies were negative, as were serological tests for Coxsackie virus, Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sonography and computed tomography revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> along the entire aortic wall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> and a contracted left kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> on the aortic valve leaflets </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tests for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies in serum and a skin biopsy provided the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As the skin biopsy showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, immunosuppressive treatment was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This stabilized the condition and he was discharged to be followed by his general practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS can cause complex symptoms in many organs, but effective treatment (anticoagulation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, immunosuppressives) is available, as this case demonstrates </plain></SENT>
