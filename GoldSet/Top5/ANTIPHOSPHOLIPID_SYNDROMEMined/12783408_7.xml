<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several surgical and nonsurgical risk factors have been associated with HAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retransplantation often is the only possible treatment for this complication; however, the incidence of recurrence of HAT after retransplantation and the underlying conditions of this occurrence have never been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 629 consecutive recipients transplanted at a single institution, 24 underwent retransplantion for HAT: in 4 of them (16%), HAT recurred in the second graft; 3 of these patients lost their first graft because of late HAT, whereas another one lost 4 consecutive grafts for early HAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> were diagnosed in three and one of these patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent HAT is an uncommon occurrence that, in our experience, was linked to specific thrombophilic conditions; careful screening of these disorders should be included in the pretransplant workup, and adequate prophylaxis is advisable </plain></SENT>
