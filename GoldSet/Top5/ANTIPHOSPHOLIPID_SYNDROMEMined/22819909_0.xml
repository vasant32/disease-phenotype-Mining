<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is a retrospective analysis of patients with BCS managed between 2004 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The diagnosis was confirmed with contrast CT-angiography and/or Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BCS was diagnosed in 20 patients (11 females and 9 males), median age 38 years (ranging from 18 to 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were referred as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BCS for the liver transplant (LTx) assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the hepatic veins was caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (n=8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">end-stage liver disease</z:e> (n=4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n=1) and secondary poliglobulia (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients the origin of BCS could not be established despite appropriate screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with subsequent conversion to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> was routinely applied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent TIPS procedure with good long term outcome and 10 subjects received LTx; 1 patient was lost to follow-up and 1 died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149725" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LRTI">chest infection</z:e> 9 years since the diagnosis of BCS was made; 14 patients, including those who received LTx, were alive and well at least one year after BCS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> survivors remain stable and are followed-up on a regular basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strict adherence to the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines plays a crucial role in the management of BCS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the efficacy of anticoagulation as well as TIPS and/or OLT in treatment of this rare condition </plain></SENT>
