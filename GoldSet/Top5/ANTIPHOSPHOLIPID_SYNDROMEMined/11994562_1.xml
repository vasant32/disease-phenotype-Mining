<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a prothrombin time (PT) or an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) can be divided into a pre-coagulation phase, a coagulation phase, and a post-coagulation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These phases are further characterized by parameters that define the timing, the rate, the 'slope', and the magnitude of the signal change of the reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the transmittance waveform parameters obtained during PT and aPTT of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) who were or were not taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, and non-APLA patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abnormal deflection in the pre-coagulation phase of the PT (called slope 1) was observed in 61.5% of the patients with APLA, in contrast to 5.9% of non-APLA patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (P= 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of an abnormal PT slope 1 was reagent specific and was inversely correlated with the anticardiolipin antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, which suggests that the abnormal PT slope 1 may reflect interactions between patient IgG and components from the thromboplastin, possibly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal PT slope 1 values may be of diagnostic utility in the identification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
