<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> receive doses of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of more than 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no prospective data to support this approach to thromboprophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were assigned to receive enough <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (moderate intensity) or 3.1 to 4.0 (high intensity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to show that high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was more effective in preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were enrolled in the study and followed for a mean of 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>Recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred in 6 of 56 patients (10.7 percent) assigned to receive high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and in 2 of 58 patients (3.4 percent) assigned to receive moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (hazard ratio for the high-intensity group, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 15.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in three patients assigned to receive high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and four patients assigned to receive moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was not superior to moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for thromboprophylaxis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> among patients in whom the target INR was 2.0 to 3.0 suggests that moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is appropriate for patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
