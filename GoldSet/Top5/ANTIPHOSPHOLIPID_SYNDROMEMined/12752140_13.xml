<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medium-sized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>), occasionally present with ulceration resulting in ivory-white stellate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> on the lower limbs and may potentially be misdiagnosed as livedoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the occurrence, clinical and immunopathological features of medium-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in patients presenting with atrophie blanche without clinical and/or compression duplex ultrasonographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients presenting with atrophie blanche at the Department of Dermatology of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, from April 1996 until April 2002, following the diagnostic guidelines for leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> of the Division of Immunodermatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deep and multiple skin biopsies were performed for histology </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 29 consecutive patients presenting with atrophie blanche, six had underlying medium-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> consistent with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>, three of whom had previously been diagnosed to have segmental hyalinizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>/vasculopathy (livedoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>/vasculopathy) on superficial biopsies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the six cutaneous <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi> patients, four had neurological involvement evidenced by clinical symptoms and nerve conduction studies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 23 patients, two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and one had homocystineaemia; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three also had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Repeated and deep biopsies are often necessary to reveal the accurate underlying pathology of necrotizing medium-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the reticular dermis and the subcutis, especially in the setting of atrophie blanche lesions </plain></SENT>
