<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of traditional risk factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in comparison to those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transversal study of 96 APS patients (Sapporo's criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and drug use were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine Primary APS and 57 secondary APS were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ regarding age (38.5 +/- 9.9 vs. 39.4 +/- 10.5 years, p=0.84) and female gender (84.6 vs. 96.5%, p=0.06), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial events were more observed in primary than secondary APS (59 vs. 36.8%, p=0.04) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen concerning venous and obstetric events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In regard to traditional risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, both groups were comparable related to current or previous smoking, sedentarism, family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, overweight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of altered <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were alike in the two groups, except for a higher prevalence of low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c levels in primary APS group (84.6 vs. 45.5%, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerning drug use, no significant differences were observed related to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use, however the secondary APS patients had a higher rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> use (10.2 vs. 57.9%, p&lt;0.001) as well as mean dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> (1.5 +/- 5.7 vs. 9.2 +/- 12.5mg/ /day, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Traditional risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> are present and comparable between patients with primary and secondary APS, except for a high frequency of low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c in primary APS patients </plain></SENT>
