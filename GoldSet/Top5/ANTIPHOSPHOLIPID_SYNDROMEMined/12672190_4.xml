<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in determining the strength of association between various antiphospholipid and anti-protein cofactor antibodies (aPA) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pregnancy morbidity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory variables were retrospectively studied in 204 patients: 160 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 22 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> (SLE-LS), and 22 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory evaluation included detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) and measurement of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine (aPS), antiphosphatidylinositol (aPI), anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (a beta 2GPI), and antiprothrombin (aPT) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROC plot analysis was used to determine the clinical accuracy of aPA tests, and calculate cut-off values which best associate with clinical symptoms typical for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LAC was associated with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> [odds ratio (OR): 3.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-6.2] and even more strongly with recurrent fetal loss (OR: 8.7; 95%CI: 2.8-26.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ROC plot analysis revealed that the most accurate test for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was aCL IgG (ROC-derived cutoff value &gt; 17.2 GPL; OR: 3.69; 95% CI: 1.8-7.4), for recurrent fetal loss, aPI IgG [&gt; 22.1 theoretical units (TU); OR: 6.21; 95%CI: 2.1-18.5], closely followed by aCL IgG and a beta 2GPI IgG, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> aPS IgM (&gt; 6.7 TU; OR: 1.9; 95%CI: 1.04-3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 182 autoimmune patients (SLE + SLE-LS), 6.6% presented clinical symptoms of APS without classic aPA (LAC and/or aCL), but with elevated levels of antibodies against other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, mainly aPI IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A laboratory that evaluates APS patients should establish its own threshold values for aPA tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ROC plot analysis is a valuable tool in establishing cutoff values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC and aCL determinations seem sufficient for the majority of laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in specialized centers other tests should be available to detect those patients with clinical symptoms for APS but who are positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> other than aCL and the LAC </plain></SENT>
