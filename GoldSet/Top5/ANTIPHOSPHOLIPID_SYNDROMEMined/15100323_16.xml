<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The combined presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Ab (aPL) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is recognized as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aPL represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of Ab that recognize various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL), PL-binding plasma proteins, and/or PL-protein complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found the presence of antithrombin Ab in some APS patients and that some of these anti-thrombin Ab could inhibit thrombin inactivation by antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering that thrombin is homologous to plasmin, which dissolves fibrin, we hypothesize that some APS patients may have Ab that react with plasmin, and that some anti-plasmin Ab may interfere with the plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we searched for anti-plasmin Ab in APS patients and then studied those found for their effects on the fibrinolytic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that seven of 25 (28%) APS patients have IgG anti-plasmin Ab (using the mean OD plus 3 SD of 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls as the cutoff) and that six of six patient-derived IgG anti-thrombin mAb bind to plasmin with relative K(d) values ranging from 5.6 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-6) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These K(d) values probably represent affinities in the higher ranges known for human IgG autoantibodies against protein autoantigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these mAb, one could reduce the plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that plasmin may be an important driving Ag for some aPL B cells in APS patients, and that the induced anti-plasmin Ab may act either directly, by binding to plasmin and inhibiting its fibrinolytic activity, or indirectly, by cross-reacting with other homologous proteins in the coagulation cascade to promote <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
