<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a second study, 11 APL positive patients were randomly supplemented either with (n = 6) or without (n = 5) <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> (vitamin E at 900 IU day(-1), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> at 2000 mg day(-1)) for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a third study, TF and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> were measured in human monocytes incubated with anti-beta(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta(2)GP(1)) or control IgG, either with or without vitamin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APL-positive patients had higher values of isoprostanes (P &lt; 0.05) and monocyte TF antigen (P = 0.001) and activity (P = 0.0001) than APL-negative subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only in APL positive patients did monocyte TF antigen correlate significantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>(2alpha-III) (rho 0.79; P &lt; 0.003) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>(2alpha-VI) (rho = 0.87; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who received <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementation, we found a significant decrease of isoprostanes (P &lt; 0.05) and monocyte TF antigen (P &lt; 0.01) and activity (P &lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments demonstrated that anti-beta(2)GP(1) antibodies dose-dependently enhanced the monocyte production of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> and TF, which were significantly inhibited by vitamin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that in APL-positive patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> contributes to activate the clotting system via over-expression of monocyte TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that anti-beta(2)GP(1) antibodies could play a pivotal role by enhancing the monocyte production of oxygen free radicals </plain></SENT>
