<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from literature reveal that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal failure</z:e> was present in between 10 and 26% of patients with catastrophic APS and that one-third of patients presented with adrenal involvement during the course of catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adrenal involvement may be the first clinical manifestation of this syndrome, whereas a few patients may have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008207'>Addison's disease</z:hpo> in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathological mechanisms involved in the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> in APS are still not clearly understood, but the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in these patients supports the concept that adrenal haemorrhagic infarction may possibly be related to adrenal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present article,we review the pathogenic mechanisms and main clinical, laboratory and treatment features of patients suffering adrenal involvement with aPL to support the idea that APS leads to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
