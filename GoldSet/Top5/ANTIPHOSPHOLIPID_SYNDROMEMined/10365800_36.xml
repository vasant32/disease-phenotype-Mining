<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of 88 consecutive patients (78 female and 10 male), with a mean age of 39 years (range 15-79), was prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been diagnosed with APS: 54 (61%) primary APS and 34 (39%) APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A group of 200 apparently healthly blood donors was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-HCV antibodies were investigated in the serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients using a third-generation ELISA and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-HCV was investigated in anti-HCV positive samples by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and antiprothrombin antibodies were evaluated by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was studied by coagulometric assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 2 (2.2%) patients showed positivity for anti-HCV antibodies, but none of them had clinical or biochemical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-HCV was not detected in serum of any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was positive in 57% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were positive in 60% of patients, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies in 43% of patients, and antiprothrombin antibodies in 56% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-HCV in blood donors was 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anti-HCV in patients with APS is low and similar to that in healthy people in our area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> does not seem to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
