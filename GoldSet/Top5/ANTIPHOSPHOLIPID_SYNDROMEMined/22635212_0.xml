<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The laboratory criteria of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> include one coagulation assay (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [LA]) and two solid phase assays (anticardiolipin [aCL] and anti-ß(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies [aß(2)GPI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>External quality control (EQC) surveys show that negative and clearly positive LA samples are classified correctly by about 95% of laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For 'weak' LA there is a wide variability in samples' classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when a weak LA sample is used in two different EQC surveys more than 50% of laboratories classify it differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some surveys weak LA samples were found to be positive for aCL and for aß(2)GPI by a majority of laboratories; the main reason for laboratories which classified these samples as LA negative was a negative result in the mixing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is likely that, depending on the sensitivity of the assay, a weak LA cannot be detected anymore after 1:1 dilution of the sample with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend the use of integrated assays, such as screen/confirm ratios, for the detection of weak LA samples </plain></SENT>
