<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunological mechanisms leading to RSA and REPF seem to be different, although both syndromes probably have a genetic background that has not been identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is a well-established cause of repeated pregnancy loss, the role of different autoantibodies existing in RSA and REPF patients needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapy is believed to correct the detrimental immune reactions; however, its real effectiveness and safety for the treatment of distinct forms of pregnancy loss need to be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
