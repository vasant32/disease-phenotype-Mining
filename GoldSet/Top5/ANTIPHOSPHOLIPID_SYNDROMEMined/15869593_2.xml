<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factor XII antibodies (FXIIab) have been described in some patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and have been shown to lead to reduced levels of FXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigenic binding site(s) and the pathophysiological effects of FXIIab are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to elucidate the binding site of these antibodies, immobilized plasma kallikrein was used to cleave FXII into its 52-kDa heavy-chain (HCFXII) and 28-kDa light-chain (LCFXII) components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples from 12 female patients with definite APS and FXIIab were investigated for the presence of antibodies to FXII, HCFXII and LCFXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient's plasma reacted to FXII, HCFXII and LCFXII in a similar manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient gave markedly reduced positivity to HCFXII and LCFXII, suggesting that the FXIIab in this patient had a higher affinity for the intact FXII molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the antigenic binding site(s) of FXII, 150 biotinylated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the known FXII sequence were synthesized using a Multipin(TM) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> synthesis procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IgG and IgM fractions of the 12 patients' plasma were purified by affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The synthesized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were captured on streptavidin plates and individual patients' purified FXIIab assayed against the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two regions were identified as possible antigenic binding site(s) for FXIIab: one in the growth factor domain and the other in the catalytic domain </plain></SENT>
