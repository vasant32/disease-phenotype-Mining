<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently we reported early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in MRL/(+2) mice following immunization with beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a close association between aPL with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, recurrent fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the effect of beta 2 GPI-induced aPL on pregnancy outcomes in an inbred strain of mice (PL/J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Three groups of seven-week female PL/J mice (12 per group) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group A was immunized with beta 2 GPI and group B with ovalbumin; group C was not not immunized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After two booster injections, the mice were tested for aPL, anti-DNA by ELISA, and for ANA by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet count and pregnancy outcomes were studied at the age of 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The aPL and anti-DNA levels were higher at 12 and 14 weeks in group A; the optical densities (OD) were 1.72 +/- 0.6 and 0.699 +/- 0.25 for group A, 0.09 +/- 0.040 and 0.230 +/- 0.47 for group B, and 0.0435 +/- 0.003 and 0.119 +/- 0.26 for group C (comparing group A with groups B and C combined, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ANA titers rose in groups A and B by age, but they were significantly higher at 14 weeks in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean titers were 1/286, 1/90, and 1/16 for A, B, and C, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The platelet counts were not significantly different among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The titer size was significantly smaller in group A, as evidenced by the numbers of viable fetuses among the mice that became pregnant in each group: 0.75, 2.45, and 5.5 in groups A, B, and C, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seven pregnant mice in group A had complete resorption, seven pregnant mice in group B showed focal (partial) resorption areas, by only one mouse in group C had complete resorption of the embryos, as shown by histopathological studies, although the fecundity rate was similar in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a pathogenic role for beta 2 GPI-induced aPL in the development of experimental models of APS in PL/J mice </plain></SENT>
