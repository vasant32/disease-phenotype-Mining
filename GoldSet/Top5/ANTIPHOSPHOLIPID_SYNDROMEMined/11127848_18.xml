<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanism underlying the prothrombotic tendency of Hughes' or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous procoagulant mechanisms have been tested including platelet activation, monocyte tissue factor (TF) expression and endothelial cell (EC) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence for the latter from studies on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incubation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) induces EC activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there was evidence of EC perturbation in vivo using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) for soluble markers of EC dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum and plasma were collected from controls and patients with primary APS and ELISAs performed to quantify soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (sVCAM), soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (sICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), endothelin-1 (ET-1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and soluble tissue factor (sTF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, soluble p-selectin (p-selectin) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured: the former as a marker of platelet activation, the latter as a potential mediator of TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the levels of blood-borne soluble markers were detected between the patient and control groups except for VEGF and sTF, patients having significantly higher levels of VEGF and sTF than controls (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest plasma soluble tissue factor and VEGF may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS, although the cell of origin of these molecules remains unclear </plain></SENT>
