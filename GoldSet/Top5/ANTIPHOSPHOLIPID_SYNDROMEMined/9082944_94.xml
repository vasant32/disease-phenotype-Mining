<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six human affinity-purified polyclonal anti-beta 2 GPI IgG and 2 IgM monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were obtained from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were tested for their ability to 1) bind to endothelial monolayers through the adherent beta 2 GPI and 2) modulate endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> (6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>) secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The affinity-purified IgG and the MAb with anti-beta 2 GPI activity, but not the respective controls, displayed EC binding, which declined on cells incubated in serum-free medium and was restored in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous human beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After EC binding, both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies up-regulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2 GPI MAb also significantly increased IL-6 and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies bind and activate EC through the adherent cofactor beta 2 GPI, likely leading to a procoagulant state </plain></SENT>
