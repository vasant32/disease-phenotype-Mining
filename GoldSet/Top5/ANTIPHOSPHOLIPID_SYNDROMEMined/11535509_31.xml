<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the prevalence and clinical significance of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> were investigated in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and immunoglobulin G/M anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (37.8%) were <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> positive at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-positive and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-negative groups regarding gender, initial platelet counts, or response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 years of follow-up, cumulative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free survival of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-positive (n = 31) and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-negative (n = 51) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients was 39% and 97.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found between these groups by log-rank test (P =.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, LA was an important risk marker for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 38 months, 14 ITP patients (45%) who had <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> positivity developed clinical features (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or fetal losses) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-positive patients with and without APS regarding the initial platelet counts, response to the therapy, or ACA positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The positivity rate for LA was significantly higher in those patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> who developed APS (chi(2): P =.0036; relative risk 7.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study indicates that a significant proportion of patients initially presenting with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> positivity developed APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, the persistent presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> is an important risk factor for the development of APS </plain></SENT>
