<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LAC activity can be caused by anti-prothrombin (FII)- and/or anti-beta2glycoprotein I (beta2GPI)-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the contribution of anti-FII-antibodies to LAC activity was measured in 28 LAC positive plasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasmas were incubated with prothrombin or BSA, immobilized on CNBr-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi>, to absorb <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-FII-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 out of the 28 plasmas LAC activity was completely dependent on anti-FII-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 out of the 28 plasmas, anti-FII-antibodies did not contribute to LAC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These anti-FII-antibodies can be regarded as non-functional antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the majority (17/28) of the samples, LAC activity within a single plasma was caused by a combination of antibodies with different specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both dRVVT and KCT showed comparable sensitivity for the detection of functional anti-FII-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in most samples LAC activity is not caused by anti-FII-antibodies alone but by a combination of different types of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of LAC activity and anti-FII-antibodies in one plasma does not automatically implicate that these antibodies are responsible for the LAC activity </plain></SENT>
