<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the biologic function of this abundant protein is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we identify β(2)-GPI as a complement regulator. β(2)-GPI circulates in the plasma in an inactive circular form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On surface binding, such as to apoptotic cells, β(2)-GPI changes conformation to an elongated form that acquires C3/C3b binding activities. β(2)-GPI apparently changes conformation of C3, so that the regulator factor H attaches and induces subsequent degradation by the protease factor I. β(2)-GPI also mediates further cleavage of C3/C3b compared with factor H alone </plain></SENT>
