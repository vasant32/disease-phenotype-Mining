<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-β₂GPI) were demonstrated to be pathogenic in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they can be detected in patients with no features of APS, especially those affected by systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (SAD), and so in healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that anti-β₂GPI against domain 1 (D1) associate with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, while those recognising domain 4/5 (D4/5) are present in non-thrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the fine specificity of anti-β₂GPI in adults and infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups were examined-group A: 57 1-year-old healthy children born to mothers with SAD; group B: 33 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo>; group C: 64 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: were selected based on positive anti-β₂GPI IgG results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were tested for anti-β₂GPI IgG D1 and D4/5 using research ELISAs containing recombinant β₂GPI domain antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children (A and B) displayed preferential IgG reactivity for D4/5, whereas patients with APS were mainly positive for D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic events were recorded in groups A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The specificity for D4/5 suggests that anti-β₂GPI IgG production in children born to mothers with SAD is a process neither linked to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> nor related to the maternal autoantibody status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This unusual fine specificity might, at least partially, account for the 'innocent' profile of such antibodies </plain></SENT>
