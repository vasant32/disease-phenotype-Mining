<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought evidence that beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, a major target antigen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, is involved in regulation of protein S activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of purified protein S or plasma with beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I reversed functional modulation of protein S by its plasma inhibitor, the C4b-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a plasma-free ELISA, beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I prevented the binding of protein S and C4b-binding protein when preincubated with immobilized protein S but not when similarly preincubated with C4b-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I in fluid phase interfered with precipitation of protein S by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi>-bound C4b-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I on protein S function were inhibited by one of four monoclonal anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I helps maintain adequate plasma levels of circulating free, active protein S </plain></SENT>
