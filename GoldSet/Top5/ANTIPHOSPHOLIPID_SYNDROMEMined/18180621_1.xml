<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> interfere with fibrinolysis, their combined modulating effects were investigated in experimental models of three consecutive steps of the fibrinolytic process [diffusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) into the clot, plasminogen activation on fibrin surface and fibrin dissolution by plasmin] using IgGs isolated from healthy subjects and from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in combination with mixtures of synthetic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fibrin clots containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG enhanced the barrier function of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> with respect to the diffusion of tPA and plasminogen activation, but did not modify the lysis by plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-IgGs also restricted the diffusion of tPA, but it accelerated the plasminogen activation on the fibrin surface and slowed down the lysis of fibrin by plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> IgG, which did not affect significantly the tPA penetration into the fibrin gel, did not modify the plasminogen activation on its own, but it partially opposed the inhibiting effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> on plasmin formation and accelerated the end-stage lysis of fibrin containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IgGs from the two examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patients did not show consistent deviation from the pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG effects on fibrinolysis in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a high degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> with respect to the profibrinolytic or antifibrinolytic effects of the pathological IgGs can be expected in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patient population, which may contribute to the variable thrombotic symptoms in this clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
