<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation of the antibodies with different clinical and analytical features was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four patients with AS (71 men) and 40 age and sex matched controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPL determinations included: anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) of the IgM, IgG, and IgA classes, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), and a false positive serologic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between variables were done by Student t test, Mann-Whitney test and Chi squared test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between aPL and clinical variables were performed by Pearson coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with AS (29%) has positive IgG aCL, compared with only 2 cases in the control group (5%) (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in other aPL determinations between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the presence of aCL (IgG, IgM, or IgA) and LAC and the different aspects of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients fulfilled the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the presence of IgG aCL in patients with AS higher than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population but their relation with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and other systemic manifestations seems weak </plain></SENT>
