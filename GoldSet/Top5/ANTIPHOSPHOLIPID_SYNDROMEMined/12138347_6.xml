<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> during pregnancy significantly and substantially reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although triple therapy is the standard of care for management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> in adults, the safety of many approved antiretroviral agents in pregnancy is not currently established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: An open-label pilot study conducted in Thailand and the UK of the safety of saquinavir soft-gel capsules 1200 mg three times daily administered in the second and third trimester of pregnancy in combination with local standard-of-care antiretroviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infants received local standard-of-care antiretroviral therapy after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Steady-state pharmacokinetics were performed in a subset of mothers at 4 weeks after the commencement of saquinavir therapy and paired samples collected from the mother and infant cord blood at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen antiretroviral-naive pregnant women with a mean <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load of 4.2 log10 and CD4 cell count of 481/mm(3) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">zidovudine</z:chebi> and 3 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the UK) received lamivudine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events and no discontinuations due to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> load declined by 1.6 log10 at week 4 and was less than 400 copies/mL at delivery in 16/17 mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen live births were recorded, with two in utero <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>-one secondary to an accident and the second due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were considered by investigators to be unrelated to study therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> infants were HIV negative at subsequent follow-up and no fetal abnormalities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data suggested that mothers had relatively low exposures to saquinavir despite an excellent virologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Saquinavir was not detected in cord blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Saquinavir soft-gel capsules are well tolerated during pregnancy and are not associated in this small study with birth abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transmission of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> from mother to child was successfully prevented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Low maternal exposures of saquinavir were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, these did not appear to affect virologic efficacy of the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Samples from cord blood indicate minimal fetal exposure to saquinavir </plain></SENT>
