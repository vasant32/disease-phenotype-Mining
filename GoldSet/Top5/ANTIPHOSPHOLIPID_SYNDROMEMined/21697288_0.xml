<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By studying their effect on crystalline annexin A5 shield on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces (one of proposed pathogenic mechanisms), with the use of atomic force microscopy, the pathogenic potential of HAv anti-β(2)GPI antibodies was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by using surface plasmon resonance and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, unique binding characteristics of HAv antibodies in comparison with low avidity antibodies were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HAv anti-β(2)GPI were confirmed to (i) recognize β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I in a solution, (ii) interact predominantly monovalently (much lower dependency on the antigen density) and (iii) form more stable complexes with the antigen </plain></SENT>
