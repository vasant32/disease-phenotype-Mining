<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: It has been proposed that antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent antigens (aPLs), induce recurrent pregnancy loss and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> through modulation of endothelial cell function, yet aPLs have not been conclusively shown to bind with endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Using indirect immunofluorescence we investigated the anti-endothelial cell reactivity of three monoclonal antibodies that differentiate between the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) and phosphatidylserine (PS): BA3B5C4 (CL+/PS+); 3SB9b (CL-/PS+); and D11A4 (CL+/PS-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured umbilical cord endothelial cells were prepared without fixation or with cold <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the aPLs reacted with endothelial cells prepared without fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3SB9B reacted strongly with cytoskeletal-like components in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi>-fixed cells, whereas BA3B5C4 and D11A4 were unreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytoskeletal-like binding of 3SB9b was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody against vimentin, whereas antibodies against tubulin or actin were not inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> extraction of the cells destroyed the 3SB9b reactive antigen without affecting the reactivity of anti-vimentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent antigenic determinants are not expressed on the surface of resting endothelial cells but that a PS-dependent antigenic determinant is associated with endothelial cell intermediate filaments </plain></SENT>
