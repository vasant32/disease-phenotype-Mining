<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pilot study aimed to determine whether SLE therapy during pregnancy was associated with developmental delays in offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cohort study included SLE patients with at least one live birth post-diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical histories were obtained via interviews and chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between SLE therapy during pregnancy and maternal report of special educational (SE) requirements (as proxy for developmental delays) among offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Propensity scoring (incorporating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> use, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> flare, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>) was used to account for disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 60 eligible offspring from 38 mothers, 15 required SE services, the most common indication for which was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000750'>speech delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7 of the 13 (54%) children with in utero AZA exposure utilized SE services versus 8 of 47 (17%) non-exposed (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for pregnancy duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, propensity score, maternal education and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, AZA was significantly associated with SE utilization occurring from age 2 onward (OR 6.6, 95% CI 1.0, 43.3), and bordered significance for utilization at any age or age &lt;2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AZA exposure during SLE pregnancy was independently associated with increased SE utilization in offspring, after controlling for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is indicated to fully characterize developmental outcomes among offspring with in utero AZA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vigilance and early interventions for suspected developmental delays among exposed offspring may be warranted. Â© 2012 by the American College of Rheumatology </plain></SENT>
