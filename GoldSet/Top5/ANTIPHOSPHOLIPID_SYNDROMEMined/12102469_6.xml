<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen SLE patients who died at our department from 1988 to 1996 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' medical files were reviewed for the clinical history and the presence of IgG and IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy samples of various organs, including regularly the kidneys, heart, brain and skin, were studied by standard histological methods and the direct immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 (93%) autopsied SLE patients were persistently positive for IgG aCL and had common overt thrombotic complications and/or other clinical features related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their autopsy tissue samples showed frequent occlusive vascular changes such as bland thromboses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) related changes and arterial intimalfibrous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immune complex related vascular changes were mostly unremarkable and present mainly in low aCL positive patients, who also had more aggressive types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased IgG aCL were found in 13 out of 14 autopsied SLE patients who had predominant occlusive vascular histopathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The coincidence of bland thromboses with a characteristic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> histopathology suggested two pathogenetic mechanisms associated with the presence of aCL, one related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e> and the other to endothelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of granular vascular immune deposits, typical of SLE, and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp> were inversely related to the aCL level </plain></SENT>
