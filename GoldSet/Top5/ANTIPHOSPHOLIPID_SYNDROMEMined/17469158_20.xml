<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We generated 4 new IgG monoclonal aPL (2 screened against beta2GPI, 1 against thrombin, and 1 against protein C) from 2 APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were analyzed for binding to beta2GPI, thrombin, APC, and plasmin, as well as for anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate a shared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> between beta2GPI and a serine protease, 1 mAb was studied by cross-inhibition analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both of the IgG anti-beta2GPI mAb bound to thrombin, APC, and plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the 1 anti-thrombin mAb and the 1 anti-protein C mAb also bound to beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the binding of 1 cross-reactive mAb to beta2GPI was inhibited by alpha-thrombin (which contains only the catalytic domain of thrombin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 mAb displayed aCL activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together with the findings that some aCL bind to several serine proteases that participate in hemostasis and share homologous catalytic domains, these data demonstrate that some aCL in APS patients recognize one or more conformational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> shared by beta2GPI and the catalytic domains of disease-relevant serine proteases </plain></SENT>
