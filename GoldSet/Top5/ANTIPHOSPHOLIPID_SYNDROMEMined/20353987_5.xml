<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events at the placental level cannot explain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that aPL may be responsible for a local <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> mediated by complement activation and neutrophil infiltration eventually leading to fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However histological and immunohistological studies on human placental samples do support such a mechanism only in part and with no any clear relationship with the pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A direct effect of aPL on both maternal and fetal placental tissues has been reported through the reactivity of the antibodies with beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) expressed on the cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These events do not require an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and can be in part related to the inhibition of growth factors favouring a physiological placentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding the different pathogenic mechanisms of aPL-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> may help in improving our therapeutic approach particularly in recurrent cases not responsive to the usual treatment </plain></SENT>
