<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although no significant differences in thrombin-induced prostacyclin release were found in any of the patient groups, further analysis revealed that PDS from patients with SLE and APS that contained IgG anticardiolipin antibodies produced significant inhibition of prostacyclin release when compared with controls (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect was maximal with samples that contained both IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (P less than 0.01) and which had a significantly higher titre of IgG antibodies than samples which contained solely IgG antibodies (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absence of any corresponding inhibition of prostacyclin release by serum samples that contained anticardiolipin antibodies, possibly due to the release of masking stimulatory factors by platelets during coagulation, provides an explanation for the conflicting nature of previous reports </plain></SENT>
