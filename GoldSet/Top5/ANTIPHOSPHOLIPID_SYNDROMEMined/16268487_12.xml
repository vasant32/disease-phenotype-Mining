<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten manufacturers provided one IgG and one IgM kit to three testing centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from patients with primary (n = 13) or secondary (n = 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients without APS features (n = 6) and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (n = 2) were tested in the three centres according to manufacturers' instructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dilutions in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum of a pool made from positive patients' samples (Forum Calibrators) and dilutions of humanized monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were used as additional calibrators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calibration curves obtained with each calibrator differed widely between kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of positivity of patients' samples varied from 7 to 16 for IgG and from 2 to 17 for IgM, depending on the kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfect agreement occurred in 12/22 samples for IgG and 5/22 samples for IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> were found negative by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between kits, cutoff values varied up to five fold when expressed in Forum Calibrators arbitrary units and up to three fold when expressed in MoAbs equivalents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of discrepant samples indicated that about half of the discrepancies, scoring 8:2 and 9:1, involved the same few kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In highly discrepant samples, some kits appeared as high responders as compared to others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, with the exception of a few kits, agreement in assay results was acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, additional efforts are however necessary, especially concerning the way to assess the cutoff point and the adoption of a reference calibrator, in order to improve standardization of the assays </plain></SENT>
