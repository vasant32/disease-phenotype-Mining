<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured for up to six days, in the presence or absence of added cytokines in the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Supernatants harvested after culture were tested by ELISA for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Despite variation of the culture conditions and of the cell numbers and populations used, it was found that accurately measurable levels of anticardiolipin antibodies could not be detected reliably in any of the culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that alternative methods of measurement of antibody production need to be explored </plain></SENT>
