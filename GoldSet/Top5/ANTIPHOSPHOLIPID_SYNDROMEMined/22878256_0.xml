<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) have an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> (VD) such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, which can only partly be explained by traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of platelets in this process has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation supports complement binding to the platelet surface, and increased C4d has been seen on platelets in SLE patients as well as in non-rheumatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated in vivo platelet deposition of the classical complement pathway components C1q, C4d and C3d in relation to VD in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ability of serum to support in vitro complement deposition on fixed heterologous platelets was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood from 69 SLE patients and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals was collected in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="53258">sodium-citrate</z:chebi> tubes and platelets isolated by centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complement deposition on platelets was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We could demonstrate that SLE patients had increased C1q, C3d and C4d deposition on platelets as compared to healthy controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> had increased complement deposition on platelets as compared to SLE patients without this manifestation (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome supported increased platelet C4d deposition in vitro as compared to SLE patients without these manifestations (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis that platelet activation and the subsequent complement deposition on platelets are central in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altogether we suggest that complement deposition on platelets could reflect important pathogenetic events related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in SLE and might be used as a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in SLE </plain></SENT>
