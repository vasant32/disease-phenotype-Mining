<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> remains unclear, but it has been suggested that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Abs, which are laboratory markers for the disease and include species capable of binding to vascular endothelial cells, play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these anti-endothelial Abs promote <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> through interference with clearance of dying cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that healthy endothelial cell monolayers effectively remove apoptotic endothelial cells, but this clearance is markedly inhibited by serum or IgG from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and anti-endothelial Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, patient sera or IgG opsonize apoptotic endothelial cells and cause enhanced Fc-mediated uptake by professional phagocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the delayed clearance of apoptotic cells by healthy endothelial cells and the enhanced Fc-mediated macrophage uptake each result in procoagulant consequences, as judged by increased thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects on apoptotic cell clearance were reproduced by a mAb derived from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, which binds to endothelial cells and is thrombogenic in experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data support a novel, dual mechanism by which anti-endothelial Abs are prothrombotic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> by inhibiting removal of procoagulant apoptotic cells and by diverting their clearance to provoke inflammatory and prothrombotic changes in professional phagocytes </plain></SENT>
