<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We monitored the number of intravascular platelet-leukocyte aggregates (<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLAs</z:chebi>) and thrombotic occlusions (TOs) by intravascular microscopy in the mesentery of rats receiving antiphospholipid (aPL) immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL IgG had no procoagulant effect, but it caused rapid endothelial deposition of fibrinogen, followed by <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> and TO in rats receiving an intraperitoneal injection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> 3 hours before IgG infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-depleted aPL IgG failed to induce <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLAs</z:chebi> and TOs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C3 and C9 colocalized with aPL IgG on the mesenteric vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLAs</z:chebi> and TOs was markedly reduced in C6-deficient rats and in animals treated with anti-C5 miniantibody, suggesting the contribution of the terminal complement (C) complex to the aPL antibody-mediated intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate that antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I trigger coagulation subsequent to a priming proinflammatory factor and that the terminal C complex is the main mediator of the coagulation process </plain></SENT>
