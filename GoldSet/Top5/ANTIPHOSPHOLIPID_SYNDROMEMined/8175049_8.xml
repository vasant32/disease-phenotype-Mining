<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 patients (72%) were positive for aPL antibodies of different isotypes and directed to one or more PL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of IgG anticardiolipin (aCL, 37%) was similar to that of the other negatively charged PLs phosphatidylserine (PS, 35%), phosphatidylinositol (PI, 35%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17517">phosphatidylglycerol</z:chebi> (PG, 35%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (PA, 40%); prevalence reduced to 9-12% and 7-16% respectively for IgM and IgA isotypes to the same antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPL antibodies to the zwitterionic PLs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) were also observed, though their prevalence was lower than that demonstrated for negatively charged PLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 SLE patients who were aCL negative (53%), 17 (25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 47% of aCL-negative patients) were positive for aPL antibodies of different isotypes to one or more non-CL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 30 months, 10 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) with a total of 21 events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By chi 2 test, a significant correlation was found between DVT and IgG aCL (p = 0.03) and between this event and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) antibody (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, stronger correlations were demonstrated between DVT and IgA aCL (p = 0.007), IgG anti-PS (p = 0.02), and IgA anti-PC, -PI and -PG (p = 0.02, 0.003 and 0.02, respectively), whereas no correlation was found between thrombotic events and aPL antibodies with PE and PA specificities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
