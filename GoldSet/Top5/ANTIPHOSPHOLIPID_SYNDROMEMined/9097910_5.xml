<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIC from five patients were isolated by gradient centrifugation and gel filtration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distribution between serum and CIC of immunoglobulin reactivity against different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and CIC contained antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and other negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative concentration of these antibodies was higher in the immune complexes than in corresponding sera, and the avidity of antibodies in immune complex form was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of high concentrations of antibodies to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in CIC from patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies could be of pathogenic significance in APLS by conferring characteristics to the complexes of importance for binding to membrane components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This could have special implications with regard to platelet and complement activation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
