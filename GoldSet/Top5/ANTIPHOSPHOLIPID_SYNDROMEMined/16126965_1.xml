<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the structural characteristics of monoclonal APLs derived from patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient-derived B cells were immortalized using Epstein-Barr virus transformation and subsequent fusion to the <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line CB-F7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APL-producing hybridomas were cloned to obtain cell lines producing monoclonal APL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA encoding the variable region of heavy and light chains of the antibodies was sequenced and analyzed regarding their usage within the V-gene family and the existence of somatic hypermutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding patterns of APL to various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2-GPI) were determined using ELISA, with special regard to beta2-GPI dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, three APL-producing hybridoma cell lines from patients with APS were established: JGG9, HVA2, and HLC9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APLs were of the IgM isotype and showed different binding patterns toward <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of them, JGG9, showed extensive somatic hypermutations in both the CDR3 region and a framework region of the heavy chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>JGG9 bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the presence of the protein cofactor beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the antibodies HVA2 and HLC9 (which also showed somatic hypermutations in the CDR3 region) presented polyreactivity to several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-serine, -<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi>, -<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>, -<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi>-but not to beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, JGG9 presents a high degree of mutation in the CDR3 and framework region resulting from the deletions of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, and affects amino acid composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Polyreactivity and the absence of cofactor dependency present HLC9- and HVA2-like natural antibodies that have no contact with any antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, these natural antibodies show somatic hypermutation of the heavy chain, indicating antigen-driven maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Regarding the possible role of APL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, HVA2 in particular may represent a pathogen-maturated antibody showing cross-reactivity between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and infectious agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further experiments are needed to reveal the functional activity of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
