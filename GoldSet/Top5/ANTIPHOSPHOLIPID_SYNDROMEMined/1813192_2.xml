<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was evaluated at our hospital where MRI disclosed a honeycomb-like low signal intensity area rimmed by a thin Gd-enhanced layer in the left putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography revealed the lenticulostriate arteries being segmentally narrowed and a "ground glass" staining was observed in the left putamen in late venous phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sydenham's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, that had been the initial impression, was not substantiated because of negative pharyngeal culture for streptococci, negative ASLO/ASK titers and because of lack of clinical stigmata of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, prothrombin time was prolonged, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), that had been also prolonged, was not normalized by adding healthy serum, indicating the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VDRL was false positive and anticardiolipin antibodies, both IgM and IgG classes, were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was unlikely in view of negative antinuclear antibody and LE phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He deteriorated rapidly due to development of severe bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, thereby he was unable to walk or feed himself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He received a 3-day course of mega-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, that temporarily lessened the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, but soon it became worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A second course of mega-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> was given, followed by daily maintenance dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> gradually improved in severity and after 2 months only a trace of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>choreic movements</z:hpo> was detected in his hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>He has been followed at our outpatient clinic where he no longer shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and the APTT has improved to nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
