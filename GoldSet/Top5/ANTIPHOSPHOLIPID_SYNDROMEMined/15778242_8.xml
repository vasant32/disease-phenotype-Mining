<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate possible interrelations between these manifestations in a large group of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 284 APS patients were evaluated retrospectively, 159 of whom had primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> associations were determined for the entire study population, and for subgroups of patients with primary APS or APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant associations where found between cardiac vegetations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (p &lt; 0.02), and between cardiac valve thickening or dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Borderline association was found between valvar vegetations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association was also found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> valvar lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subanalyses showed that patients with primary APS had significant associations between cardiac valve pathology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> manifestations, while patients with APS associated with SLE had no such associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests potential differences in biological behaviour between primary APS and APS associated with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of cardiac valve pathology may be a risk factor for several types of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in PAPS </plain></SENT>
