<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate whether aPLs with anti-beta2GPI specificity induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of human trophoblasts in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this end, human anti-beta2GPI monoclonal IgM derived from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and a human irrelevant monoclonal IgM were incubated with human trophoblast cell cultures for 24, 48, and 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cultures we evaluated: (i) Bcl-2 and Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression by Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively; (ii) DNA fragmentation by a commercial ELISA kit and by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis; and (iii) the percentage of cells reactive with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) M30 by indirect immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were: Bcl-2/Bax ratio increased in untreated trophoblast cells during the time of culture, showing the highest values detectable after 72 h (2.68 and 2.28 at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell incubation with anti-beta2GPI MAbs induced a significant Bcl-2/Bax ratio reduction in comparison with untreated cells (1.22 and 1.28 at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, respectively, after 72 h incubation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was detected after cell exposure to irrelevant MAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, neither DNA fragmentation nor increase in cells positive for the caspase-cleaved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of cytokeratin 18 cytoskeletal protein (M30) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Conclusion, anti-beta2GPI antibodies react with trophoblast cells and reduce the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, but without any clear apoptotic effect </plain></SENT>
