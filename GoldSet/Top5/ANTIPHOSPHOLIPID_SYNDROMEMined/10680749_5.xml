<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the prevalence of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA anti-beta2-GPI antibodies was examined in APS patients and compared with IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition the value of measuring antibody isotypes and IgG subclass was investigated in the laboratory diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was established to measure IgG, IgM and IgA and IgG subclass antibodies to beta2-GPI in patients with APS and a variety of other thrombotic and non-thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Raised levels of IgM anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were observed in 65% of patients with APS, 21% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 23% with rheumatoid factor, 4% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 5% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (CAS), 17% with a biological false positive serology for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, 43% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) and 27% with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median value for IgM antibodies to beta2-GPI for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these groups ranged from 2 to 7 arbitrary units (AU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IgA antibodies to beta2-GPI were found in patients with APS (47%), SLE (13%), rheumatoid factor (26%), CAS (48%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (25%), VDRL false positive serology for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (33%), IM (47%) and HIV (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median value of IgA antibodies to beta2-GPI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these groups ranged from 2 to 4 AU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely the median value for IgG anti-beta2-GPI in APS patients was 112 AU compared to 1-4 AU in the other conditions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of IgM and IgA antibodies to beta2-GPI was much less specific and sensitive for APS than IgG, with raised levels of these isotypes seen in a variety of thrombotic and non-thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies to beta2-GPI were detected in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibody subclasses were represented in APS patients there appeared to be a significant overall skewing towards to the IgG2 subclass </plain></SENT>
