<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 44), the authors found a significant decrease of tPS, fPS and C4b-BP in 45 LA(+)aCL(+) patients (P &lt; 0.001), a decrease of tPS (P &lt; 0.001), fPS and C4b-BP (P &lt; 0.01) in eight LA(-)aCL(+) patients and a decrease of only fPS (P &lt; 0.05) in 20 LA(+)aCL(-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the levels of tPS, fPS and C4b-BP between LA(+)aCL(+) and LA(-)aCL(+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the LA(+)aCL(+) patients had lower values of tPS, fPS and C4b-BP than LA(+)aCL(-) patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some patients, protein S activity (PSact) was also measured and a high correlation was observed between fPS antigen and PSact (r = 0.93, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data show that the presence of aCL antibodies is associated with a probably acquired deficiency of PS and C4b-BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in LA patients without a CL antibodies, the fPS deficiency is unrelated to an increase in C4b-BP levels and may be due to abnormal binding of PS to C4b-BP </plain></SENT>
