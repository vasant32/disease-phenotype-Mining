<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of pregnancy morbidity but no vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are usually treated with a prophylactic dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin; whereas, those with previous vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone or associated with previous pregnancy morbidity, are commonly treated with a therapeutic dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> generally combined with low-dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in about 20% of pregnant APS women these regimens fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this context, we conducted a case-control study on a large multicentre cohort of conventionally treated pregnancies to verify whether specific laboratory profiles and/or clinical characteristics are predictive of unsuccessful pregnancy outcome during conventional treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that pregnancy failure during conventional therapies was independently associated with a history of both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and triple <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody positivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the aim to discover the most effective and safe treatments in high-risk pregnant APS women a large-scale multicentre study focusing on the effect of treatments on pregnancy outcome in women with APS and further risk factors for pregnancy failure has been designed </plain></SENT>
