<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 4 female patients aged 25-38 with SLE lasting for about 5.5 years, unilateral signs of myoarticular dysfunction of the TMJ, flattening and decrease of the articular head without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> and destruction, subcortical round foci with uneven internal contours were found in the central or median part of the head, with the compact bone above the foci thinned and the articular surface flattened; this prompted us to regard these changes as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> (AN) of the joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shortening of the mandibular branch was caused by deformation of the neck of the articular process and its declination backwards </plain></SENT>
