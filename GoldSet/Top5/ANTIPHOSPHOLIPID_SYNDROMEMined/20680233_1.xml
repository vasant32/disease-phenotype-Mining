<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPL in plasma of patients can be detected with either a prolongation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependent coagulation tests (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, LAC), or with solid phase immune assays against the protein beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (anti-beta2-GPI antibody ELISA and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody ELISA, respectively) (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a long time there was a lot of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> on who had the syndrome and who not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To solve this dispute, an international consensus meeting was organized in Sapporo in 1999 to formulate classification criteria for patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These criteria have been updated in 2004 at another international consensus meeting in Sydney (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The classification criteria were defined for scientific purposes and were aimed to be used as inclusion criteria in patient related studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were specifically not defined for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, current practice is that these criteria are used as a diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is very unfortunate because the specificity of the different aPL assays to detect the clinical manifestations that characterize APS are disputable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the aims of defining the criteria was to initiate studies to determine the value of the different anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody assays to serve as biomarker for the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recent progress made on this important topic will be discussed </plain></SENT>
