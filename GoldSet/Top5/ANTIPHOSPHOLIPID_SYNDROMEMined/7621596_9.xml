<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunization with beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) induced aPL production in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the association of these antibodies with disease manifestations remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether induction of aPL by beta 2GPI immunization in an autoimmune strain of mice (MRL/++) would result in acceleration of clinical and serological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> manifestations, three groups of 8-week-old female mice were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group was immunized with beta 2GPI, and one with ovalbumin (OVA); the third was not immunized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After two booster injections, sera were analysed for the presence of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-DNA by ELISA and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice were studied for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, fecundity rates, <z:mp ids='MP_0002288'>litter sizes</z:mp> and the development of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of aCL, anti-DNA and ANA were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> beta 2GPI-immunized, in three OVA-immunized, and in none of the unimmunized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-DNA antibodies were inhibited by CL micelles, suggesting cross-reactivity between aCL and anti-DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts, fecundity rates and <z:mp ids='MP_0002288'>litter size</z:mp> were reduced in beta 2GPI-immunized but not in OVA-immunized or unimmunized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the mice developed neurological dysfunction or significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> over a 10-week period post-immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that beta 2GPI immunization induces aPL in MRL/++ mice associated with accelerated autoimmune manifestations resembling the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
