<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prevalence of 12 thrombophilic gene mutations in RPL couples in the current results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In a total of 543 Turkish women with RPL and 327 of their male partners (870 individuals with RPL), and a control group of 106 fertile couples (control) were analyzed for factor V leiden (FVL), factor V H1299R, factor II prothrombin G20210A, FXIII V34L, Î²-fibrinogen -455G&gt;A, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), GPIIIa L33P (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>-1 a/b L33P), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T, MTHFR A1298C, ACE I/D, Apo B R3500Q, and Apo E genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall, heterozygous and/or homozygous point mutations in FVL-FVR2, ApoE2, PAI-1, MTHFR C677T-A1298C, and ACE genes were associated with RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no meaningful association between RPL and other studied genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The homozygosity of 4G in PAI-1 and MTHFR C677T genes in women with RPL, and heterozygosity of FVL, FVR2, ACE, and ApoE2 genes in both parents play crucial role in RPL and should be considered as a risk factor in RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Current results showed that RPL is related to combined parental (not only maternal) thrombophilic gene mutations </plain></SENT>
