<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We devised an assay that is able to differentiate these two types of antibodies by determining the beta 2 GPI requirements to bind in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta 2 GPI was purified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29221">perchloric acid</z:chebi> precipitation, and fixed amounts were used in the dilution solutions of the tested samples that were also tested with no source of beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ELISA plates were coated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, as usual, and blocked with a chicken ovalbumin solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum samples had to be highly diluted in order not to have beta 2 GPI from the patient serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reaction was detected with alkaline phosphate tablets and developed with pNp in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28123">diethanolamine</z:chebi> buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adapted ELISA aCL assay described here was able to discriminate infectious [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>] and autoimmune [primary APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) related APS] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further testing should be performed to demonstrate that this method consistently differentiates pathogenic antibodies that bind in an aCL ELISA only in the presence of beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
