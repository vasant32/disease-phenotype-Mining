<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The Sydney classification for diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) first introduced the determination of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI)-antibodies in serum as laboratory criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, widely differing results of anti-beta2-GPI assays are a concerning issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considerable efforts have been made to optimize ELISAs, however little attention was hitherto spent to the antigen preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the influence of different beta2-GPI preparations on the ability to separate ill and healthy patients and on the comparability of anti-beta2-GPI-assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microplates were coated with various beta2-GPI preparations and anti-beta2-GPI IgG- and IgM-ELISAs were performed for 21 APS patients and 21 controls using the monoclonal calibrators HCAL and EY2C9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, by use of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, affinity constants for the HCAL- and EY2C9-interaction with each beta2-GPI preparation were determined and antigen binding of sera of APS patients and controls was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ss2-GPI preparations showed good discrimination ability ill vs. healthy but poor inter-assay comparability in the ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affinity constants for HCAL and EY2C9 were independent of the beta2-GPI variant (K(A) 0.105 - 0.200 and 0.449 - 1.04 x 10(10)M(-1); K(D) 50.0 - 95.5 and 9.61 - 22.3 x 10(-11)M, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the biosensor, reactivity to the different beta2-GPIs was negligible for the controls and varied considerably for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inter-assay comparability of anti-beta2-GPI ELISAs is highly dependent upon the beta2-GPI preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only agreement on one common beta2-GPI preparation will improve the requested inter-assay comparability </plain></SENT>
