<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> in a large patient population with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) and also to analyze the clinical and immunological profile of patients with valvular involvement compared with those without involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of 113 patients diagnosed of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent were females and the mean age was 39 years (SD:14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of patients were diagnosed of primary APS (70 patients) and the remaining 38% (43 patients) corresponded to patients with APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of patients was 55 months (range: 7-144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cardiologic assessment was performed by means of transthoracic echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (AL) was performed by means of coagulometric assays and measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>) and anti-prothrombin (aPT) by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve was mostly involved (91%) and the most common structural abnormality corresponded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Valvular replacement was required in 24% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, a significantly higher prevalence was observed in the following parameters: total <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (71% versus 49%; p = 0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (57% versus 23%; p = 0.002), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (38% versus 13%; p = 0.01), trombocitopenia (71% versus 45%; p = 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (29% versus 9%; p = 0.02), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (48% versus 3%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As for immunological differences, only a higher prevalence of LA was found (81% versus 59%; p= 0.04) and abeta2-GPI (IgG isotype) (43% versus 22%; p = 0.05) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>Valvular heart disease</z:hpo> is more frequent in pa-tients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> is the most common lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In a patient with the diagnosis of APS, an echocar-digram should be obtained in his/her initial assessment and regular controls should be obtained in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
