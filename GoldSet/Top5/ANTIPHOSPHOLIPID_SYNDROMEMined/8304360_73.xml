<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether the features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are in any way influenced by the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We followed up patients with 'primary' APS (PAPS) and APS secondary to SLE (APS plus SLE) with the objective of comparing laboratory and clinical events and of determining whether patients with PAPS would have evolution to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 114 patients from 3 European referral centers were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six had APS plus SLE and 58 had PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and clinical data were collected during an average 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PAPS and patients with APS plus SLE had similar clinical and laboratory profiles, with the exceptions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, endocardial valve disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and low C4 levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which occurred more frequently in patients with APS plus SLE (p values: &lt; 0.05, &lt; 0.005, &lt; 0.01, and &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, 10 thrombotic episodes occurred in 10 patients, 8 of whom were receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with PAPS had either anti-DNA or anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, and these patients had a significantly lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (41%) than patients with APS plus SLE (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS plus SLE and PAPS have similar clinical profiles, although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, low C4 levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> seem to be more common in patients with APS plus SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS may develop further thrombotic events despite anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
