<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The possible relation between various biological or medical phenomena and changes in environmental physical activity, such as Solar, Geomagnetic Activity (GMA); Cosmic Ray; Proton, and other particle flux, have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These phenomena seem to be reflected, among others, in the immune system, resulting in changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) levels or outbursts of epidemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: to examine a possible association of GMA with another aspect of the immune system--<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations of levels of anticardiolipin (IgG; IgM, IgA subtypes) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (Kaulin clotting time and Dilute Russell's viper venom time) autoantibodies, serving as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anticardiolipin syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ACLS</z:e>) markers, were monitored during days of severe GMA storms and compared with those of lowest/quiet GMA days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cosmophysical data were obtained from the NOAA National Space Service Center and the National Geophysical Data Center, USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant rise in the levels of anti beta2Gp1-IgA (p = 0.0001); and KCT (p = 0.019) was observed on days of the GMA storms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On days of major GMA storms, significant changes in the autoimmune marker levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ACLS</z:e> were observed compared with quiet days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An involvement of those changes in clinical events related to GMA storms is possible </plain></SENT>
