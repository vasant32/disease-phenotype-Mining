<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the performance of the activated partial thromboplastin time using 2 reagents, a dilute Russell viper venom time, and a hexagonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> assay for detecting LAs in 105 adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 26 were taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> at the time of testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on findings, an algorithm was derived for optimal detection of LAs using 2 easily performed, automated, integrated test systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 105 patient samples, 30 (28.6%) were positive for LAs, using the algorithm interpretive criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 30 positive results, 10 were detected in the 26 patients taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis by chi2 showed no difference in performance of the integrated tests between samples from patients taking and not taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The algorithm is offered as a means for standardization of laboratory testing for LAs </plain></SENT>
