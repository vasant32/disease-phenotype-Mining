<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined whether impaired endometrial differentiation before conception contributes to the high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Timed secretory endometrial biopsies were obtained from a cohort of women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of transcripts that encode for decidual markers, proinflammatory cytokines and complement regulatory proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of decidual markers such as prolactin (PRL), tissue factor (TF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5), but not insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), was significantly lower in samples obtained from aPL(+) patients (n = 24) when compared with aPL(-) group (n = 58) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abundance of transcripts encoding for interferon gamma (IFNgamma), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) or Stat1 did not differ significantly between both groups (P &gt;/= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of transcripts that encode for complement regulatory proteins showed a marked decrease in decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) levels in aPL(+) patients (P = 0.005), which was mimicked at protein level as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, patients with RPL have distinct endometrial gene expression profiles depending on the presence or absence of circulating aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In APS, impaired endometrial differentiation and lower DAF/CD55 expression before conception may compromise implantation and predispose to complement-mediated pregnancy failure </plain></SENT>
