<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the diagnostic features of a cohort of patients presenting with autoimmune manifestations and atypical neurological features not fulfilling criteria for a well defined neurological or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine such patients were referred to our institution for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine were excluded from this study since they were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 20 patients underwent complete clinical and laboratory evaluation, spinal fluid analysis, minor salivary gland biopsy (if sicca features were present), and were tested for evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and of the spine in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain and/or spinal cord MRI abnormalities were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on morphologic criteria and distribution, these lesions were classified into 3 subsets: (1) multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS)-like (4 patients); (2) vasculitic (8 patients); and (3) nonspecific (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent underlying abnormality in patients with subgroups 1 and 2 were the presence of homozygous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) mutations (5 of 12, 41.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common findings among subgroup 3 were the presence of antithyroid antibodies (6 of 8 patients, 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Homozygous MTHFR mutations are frequently encountered in patients presenting with neurological features and MS-like or vasculitic type MRI abnormalities in a setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific MRI changes are frequently associated with antibodies against thyroid antigens </plain></SENT>
