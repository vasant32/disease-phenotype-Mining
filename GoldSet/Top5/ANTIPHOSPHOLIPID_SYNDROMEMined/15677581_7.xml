<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are the major complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), cardiac involvement is commonly present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left atrial appendage (LAA) is recognized as an important source for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to assess the structure and function of LAA with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one PAPS patients (22 women, mean age 36+/-9 years) in sinus rhythm and 31 (17 women, mean age 37+/-7 years) controls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TEE examination were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the PAPS patients had functional and structural valvular defect predominantly in the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Valvular lesions were especially frequent in PAPS patients with a history of cerebrovascular events, patients with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (91.6%), and patients with high titers of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracardiac thrombus</z:e> was present in 5 patients and in 1 of them it was located in LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structure of LAA was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left atrial appendix ejection fraction (51.8+/-4 versus 48.6+/-5.5%; P&lt;0.05) and LAA peak outflow velocity (87+/-10.9 versus 80.6+/-10.3 cm/s; P=0.02) was significantly higher in PAPS group compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In PAPS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), LAA outflow peak velocity (84.3+/-10 versus 98.6+/-6.5 cm/s; P=0.002) and LAA inflow peak velocity (67.8+/-10.5 versus 80.8+/-8.6 cm/s; P=0.009) were significantly lower compared with PAPS patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that disease process in PAPS frequently involved cardiac valves especially mitral valve but spared LAA function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LAA function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> was present in 5 patients and 1 of them was located in LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in PAPS patients seems to impair LAA function </plain></SENT>
