<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two years previously she had sustained an anterior wall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and a scar on her right kidney had been an incidental sonographic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was bluish, fine reticular discoloration over the toes of both legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: The concentration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase was raised to 250 U/l and that of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase to 300 U/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The platelet count was decreased to 75/nl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies was raised (204 U/l) and the test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A biopsy of the skin from a toe revealing livedoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND COURSE: Noncompliance, excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> ingestion, drug interaction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> were excluded as cause of the lacking action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite anti-coagulation with high-dosage low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and inhibition of platelet aggregation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and finally also immunosuppressive treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, skin necroses developed on the toes and she had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolisms</z:hpo> of which she died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Standard treatment of PAPS is effective anti-coagulation with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secondary resistance to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> is a rare occurrence: its cause remains unknown </plain></SENT>
