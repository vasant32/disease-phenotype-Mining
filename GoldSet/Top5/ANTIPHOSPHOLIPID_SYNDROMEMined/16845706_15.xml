<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 106 pediatric and adolescent SLE patients at 2 academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aPL testing was performed in standard clinical laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (23.6%) had NP manifestations, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (9.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> (4.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e> (4.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> (4.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> and pseudotumor (2.8% each), aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (0.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009676" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">confusional state</z:e> (0.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (0.9%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NP events were not necessarily accompanied by an SLE flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>aPL were positive in 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE patients, including anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 64%, aCL IgG in 56%, aCL IgM in 35%, rapid plasma reagin or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="std|stds">Venereal Disease</z:e> Research Laboratory test in 13%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant association between NP manifestations and aPL was for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and IgM aCL (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LAC was slightly more common among patients with NP events, and the finding of LAC on more than one occasion was significantly associated with developing a NP event (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NP manifestations occur in about one-fourth of children with SLE, are an early event in the course of the disease, and are not necessarily accompanied by an SLE flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> are the most frequent symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although aPL are common, their association with NP events, unlike in adults, is weak, except for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, suggesting a different pathogenic mechanism for NP manifestations in pediatric SLE </plain></SENT>
