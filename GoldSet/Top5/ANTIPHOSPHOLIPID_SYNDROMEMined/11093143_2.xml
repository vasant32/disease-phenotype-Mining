<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1 mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to label HEp-2 cell nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that anti-CL mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to recognize distinct supramolecular complexes, formed by the association of an anionic structure and a protein, that exert a strong selective pressure on autoreactive B cell clones </plain></SENT>
