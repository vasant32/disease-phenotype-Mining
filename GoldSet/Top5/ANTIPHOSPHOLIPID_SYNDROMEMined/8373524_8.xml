<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of aspirin treatment upon fetal loss in mice with experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental APLS was induced in pregnant mice by passive transfer of mouse monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice were treated with high (100 micrograms/d) or low (10 micrograms/d) dose of aspirin, using <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (100 micrograms/d or 10 micrograms/d) as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice were assessed for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (prolonged aPTT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate and mean embryo and placental weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mice with APLS had a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate (45.7 +/- 12.2% vs 2.5 +/- 0.4%, P &lt; 0.001), reduced placenta mean weight (104 +/- 8 mg vs 169 +/- 7 mg, P &lt; 0.001), prolonged aPTT (94 +/- 14 sec vs 39 +/- 4 sec, P &lt; 0.001), and reduced mean platelet count (597 +/- 186 x 10(3)/mm3 vs 847 +/- 51 x 10(3)/mm3, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group of mice with APLS, who were treated with low-dose aspirin, had a lower resorption rate (11.1 +/- 9.3% vs 45.7 +/- 12.2%, P &lt; 0.001), a higher placenta mean weight (178 +/- 8 mg vs 104 +/- 8 mg, P &lt; 0.001), a higher mean embryo weight (1042 +/- 134 mg vs 721 +/- 91 mg, P &lt; 0.001), and a lower aPTT (58 +/- 15 sec vs 94 +/- 14 sec, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice who were treated with high-dose aspirin also had a lower resorption rate, although not as much as in the low-dose aspirin group (34.2 +/- 12.7% vs 45.7 +/- 12.2%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aspirin, especially in low dose, has a protective effect against obstetrical complications associated with experimental APLS </plain></SENT>
