<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the causal role of these antibodies in the disease and the mechanisms by which the ACA may induce the syndrome are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have established an experimental mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> induced by the mouse IgM monoclonal ACA designated 2C4C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we focused on the effects of immunization with the monoclonal ACA 2C4C2 on the outcome of pregnancies in BALB/c female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four weeks after active immunization with the monoclonal ACA, a severe gestational failure with low pregnancy rates, low number of fetuses, and a high rate of resorptions was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, embryos obtained from the ACA-immunized females on day 3.5 of pregnancy were severely impaired, demonstrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These abnormal embryos failed also to develop in an in vitro implantation model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, specific binding of the 2C4C2 ACA to the trophectoderm cell lineage of in vitro implanting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryos was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our studies demonstrate that the severe ACA-induced gestational failure results from an impairment of implantation and suggest that the ACA may react directly with the preimplantation embryos </plain></SENT>
