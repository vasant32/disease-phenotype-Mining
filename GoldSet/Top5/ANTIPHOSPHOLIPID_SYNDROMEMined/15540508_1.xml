<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and IgM, antiprothrombin (aPT) IgG and IgM, anti-beta2glycoprotein 1 (abeta2GP1) IgG and IgM </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had positive aPL (8%) (LA in one patient confirmed in a second assay and abeta2GP1-IgG in the other patient confirmed one year later together with aCL IgG positivity) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive finding of aPL in 8% of patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, a frequency higher than that of the control population, deserves further studies in larger series to better explore the relationship between aPL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
