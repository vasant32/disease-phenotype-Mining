<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies are autoantibodies present in high concentrations in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), a disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>What induces aCL antibodies is uncertain, but a recent report suggested that immunization of mice with beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (beta 2 GP1) in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) resulted in aCL antibody production in the recipient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this observation might explain how autoantibodies might be induced by poor immunogens, such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, we decided to explore the question further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our first series of experiments, we found that aCL antibodies were induced in mice by beta 2GP1 mixed with adjuvants that did not contain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (Adju-Prime or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33130">aluminium hydroxide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This excluded the possibility that antibody induction occurred because beta 2GP1 formed complexes with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in FCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that aCL antibodies always appeared before anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies, excluding the possibility that aCL antibodies were directed to beta 2GP1 or were induced by formation of anti-idiotypic antibodies (to anti-beta 2GP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiments, we found that immunization of mice with human IgG antibodies from patients with the APS (IgG-APS), also induced aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunization with pure bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not induce aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that aCL antibodies are induced by proteins with high avidity for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These proteins may be bound to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> when introduced, or may bind circulating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, so transforming <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> molecules into immunogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar mechanisms might explain autoantibody induction to other poor immunogens </plain></SENT>
