<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defective placentation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> are also features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether abnormal HB-EGF expression plays a pathogenic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL)-mediated defective placentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HB-EGF expression in placental tissue was evaluated by Western blotting and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> analysis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and APS placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal IgG fractions or monoclonal beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-dependent aPL and their respective controls were investigated for the following 4 features: their binding to human trophoblast monolayers, as determined by cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); their effect on HB-EGF expression by Western blotting in trophoblast cell extracts as well as by ELISA as a protein secreted in the culture supernatants; their inhibitory effect on in vitro trophoblast invasiveness, as evaluated by Matrigel assay; and their inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels, as measured by gelatin zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were also performed in the presence of serial concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or recombinant HB-EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Placental APS tissue displayed reduced expression of HB-EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polyclonal and monoclonal aPL bound to trophoblast monolayers and significantly reduced the in vitro synthesis and secretion of HB-EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> inhibited aPL binding and restored HB-EGF expression in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of recombinant HB-EGF reduced the in vitro aPL-induced inhibition of Matrigel invasiveness as well as MMP-2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that the reduction of aPL-mediated HB-EGF represents an additional mechanism that is responsible for the defective placentation associated with APS and that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> protects from aPL-induced damage by inhibiting antibody binding </plain></SENT>
