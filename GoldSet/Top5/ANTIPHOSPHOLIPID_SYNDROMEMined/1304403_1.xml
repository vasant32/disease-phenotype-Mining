<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At monthly intervals, from 2 to 6 months of age, three MRL-lpr/lpr mice (two with anticardiolipin antibodies, one without) and two sex- and age-matched Balb/c mice (controls) were sacrificed for histological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and DNA was studied at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found thickened heart valves in 68% of MRL-lpr/lpr mice and in 80% of Balb/c mice, and no association with any of the antibodies tested was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No evidence of coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was found in any of the mice studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts in MRL-lpr/lpr mice were significantly lower (640.550 +/- 211.818 x 10(6)/ml) than in Balb/c mice (780.0 + 112.5 x 10(6)/ml) (p &lt; 0.05), and no association was found between platelet counts and aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this model of murine APS, aPL bear no importance in heart valve pathology </plain></SENT>
