<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is difficult to estimate the actual prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in the paediatric population since there are no standardised criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess clinical and laboratory characteristics of a cohort of children positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) to contribute to the understanding of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> aPL-related features in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> were enrolled and assigned to group I ("transiently positive") or group II ("persistently positive"), based on the detection of elevated aPL plasma levels [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL), and anti-β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies] on, respectively, one or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, by standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical history and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three (75%) patients were assigned to group I, while the other 11 (25%) formed group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major associated diseases in group I were urticarial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (21%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (18%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia</z:e> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five subjects (15%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four out of the 11 subjects (36%) in group II had thrombotic events; they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persistently aPL-positive and two of them had concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of detection of LA-positivity was not significantly different between the two groups (76% vs 91%, p&gt;0.05), whereas the percentage of patients positive for overall aCL was higher in group II than in group I (54% vs 42%, respectively; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, aCL IgG and anti-β2GPI IgM subtypes were significantly more represented in group II than in group I (100% vs 62% and 75% vs 33%, respectively; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our study shows that aPL-positive children have different features that should be taken into account in the classification of criteria for paediatric APS </plain></SENT>
