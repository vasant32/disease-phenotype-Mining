<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether antiplatelet agents, dilazep and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, inhibit tissue factor (TF) expression on monocytes induced by IgG from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes were allowed to adhere on plastic and then cultured in media containing patient or control antibodies and/or other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> with or without dilazep or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TF activity on monocytes was investigated by measuring factor VIIa-dependent generation of factor Xa, using a chromogenic substrate and the TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was examined by real-time PCR (TaqMan PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TF activity on monocytes induced by APS IgG (250 mg/L) was inhibited by dilazep (0.15-150 micromol/L) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (0.2-200 micromol/L) in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But, the TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression induced by APS IgG was not inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">Theophylline</z:chebi> (500 micromol/L), an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, could counteract the inhibitory effect of dilazep and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> on TF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet agents, dilazep and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, block APS IgG-induced monocytes TF expression at a post-transcriptional level, partly by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological agents that block monocytes TF activity, such as dilazep and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, are a novel therapeutic approach in APS </plain></SENT>
