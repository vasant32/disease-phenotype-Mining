<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, few studies have been performed, numbers of patients investigated are relatively small and results are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a multicentre study organized to investigate further this clinically relevant issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of nine <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> centres was asked to collect plasma samples from patients with APS who were on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (cases) and patients without APS who were on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine thromboplastins (three human recombinant, one from human placenta and five from rabbit brain) were calibrated at the co-ordinating centre according to World Health Organization guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the INR and factor X amidolytic activity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frozen plasmas were performed centrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients investigated were 58 cases and 57 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between-reagent variability of the INR was higher in cases [coefficient of variation (CV) = 12.4%] than in controls (CV = 6.7%), but this was because of one of the thromboplastins only (Thromborel R, human recombinant), which measured considerably higher INR values than the others in cases but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate that LA interference on the PT-INR measured with the majority of commercial thromboplastins is not enough to cause concern if insensitive thromboplastins, properly calibrated to assign them an instrument-specific International Sensitivity Index are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New thromboplastins, especially those made of relipidated tissue factor, should be checked for their responsiveness to LA before they are used to monitor oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
