<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition very few cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> in anti-phospolipid syndrome (APS) have been described, being this complication usually related to microthrombosis and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">capillaritis</z:e> of pulmonary vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe two patients without previous clinical manifestations of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome that showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> with anticardiolipin antibodies positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first of them, a 33-year-old male, began his disease with low prothrombin time and the presence of antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the biopsy by thoracoscopy the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">capillaritis</z:e> nor thrombotic phenomena was demonstrated, becoming evident certain clinical improvement and normalization of the prothrombin time after receiving immunosuppressive treatment but with persistence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second case, a 89-year-old male, began his condition with bilateral lung infiltrates and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo>, anticardiolipin antibodies positivity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp>, with recurrence of the condition 1 year later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After other etiological possibilities were ruled out, and despite hemorrhagic trait in both patients, we consider that they should be in the clinical context of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, although at this time they did not meet the criteria recognized in order to diagnose this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the ampliable clinical spectrum of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome we should take into account the <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
