<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To present a dramatic case of simultaneous bilateral central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and anticardiolipin autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Interventional case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, B-mode ultrasonography, and laboratory serologies were performed on a 65-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> who presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of decreased vision in his right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fundus examination disclosed a nonischemic central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the next 3 weeks, a nonperfused central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion developed in both eyes and subsequent neovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> developed in his left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Throughout this time, his white blood cell and platelet counts remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and his serum viscosity remained low, but anticardiolipin antibodies were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case reveals the occurrence of simultaneous bilateral central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion associated with anticardiolipin antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and suggests an additional mechanism other than hyperviscosity for bilateral central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusions in leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
