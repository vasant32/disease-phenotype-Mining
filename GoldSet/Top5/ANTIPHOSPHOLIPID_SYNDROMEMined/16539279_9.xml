<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suspicion is reinforced by the observation that beta2GPI is the major target for autoantibodies in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about its circulating levels in common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured beta2GPI levels in 344 healthy controls, 58 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies, 102 patients with non-haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 121 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome and 200 patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, we found a strong positive correlation between age and beta2GPI concentration (r = 0.274, P &lt; 0.001) and that beta2GPI levels fall significantly after the eighth week of pregnancy (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found significantly reduced levels of beta2GPI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in elderly patients with myocardial syndrome (P = 0.013 and 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in neither group did beta2GPI levels change in the following six months, suggesting that the reduced levels were not a transient post-event phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, beta2GPI levels showed a significant negative correlation with CRP (r = -0.284, P &lt; 0.001) and positively correlated with albumin and transferrin (r = 0.372 and 0.453, respectively with P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the largest reduction in beta2GPI levels occurred in patients with the highest CRP values (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
