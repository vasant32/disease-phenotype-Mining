<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that inflammatory processes modulate thrombogenic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, the potential cross-talk between innate immunity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the precise molecular pathway by which complement and neutrophils trigger the coagulation process have remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that antiphospholipid Ab-induced complement activation and downstream signaling via C5a receptors in neutrophils leads to the induction of tissue factor (TF), a key initiating component of the blood coagulation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TF expression by neutrophils was associated with an enhanced procoagulant activity, as verified by a modified prothrombin time assay inhibited by anti-TF mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies using the complement inhibitor compstatin revealed that complement activation is triggered by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) IgG and leads to the induction of a TF-dependent coagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blockade studies using a selective C5a receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and stimulation of neutrophils with recombinant human C5a demonstrated that C5a, and its receptor C5aR, mediate the expression of TF in neutrophils and thereby significantly enhance the procoagulant activity of neutrophils exposed to APS serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results identify a novel cross-talk between the complement and coagulation cascades that can potentially be exploited therapeutically in the treatment of APS and other complement-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
