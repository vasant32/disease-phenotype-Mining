<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have demonstrated a point prevalence of 26% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the effect of anticoagulation on blood pressure control and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 23 patients retrospectively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen received oral anticoagulation for more than 1 yr (target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 3.0-4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on their INR (&lt; 3.0 and &gt; or = 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had repeat magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or an angiogram of the renal arteries after 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 8/14 patients managed to maintain their INR &gt; or = 3.0 (median INR 3.1, range 2.8-3.7) while six had a INR &lt; 3.0 (median INR 1.9, range 1.2-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a median INR &lt; 3.0 had poorly controlled blood pressure and there was significant deterioration in mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> values (Wilcoxon's test, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent follow-up renal artery imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of nine patients with an INR &lt; 3.0 (median INR 1.9) had re-stenosis and a fourth developed bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients with INR &gt; or = 3.0 (median INR 3.1) did not show re-stenosis of the renal arteries; their renal function was stable and blood pressure was well controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One other patient with secondary APS (mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e>) with INR &gt; 3.0 showed recanalization of the stenosed renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation with INR maintained &gt; or = 3.0 helped to control the blood pressure and prevent the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
