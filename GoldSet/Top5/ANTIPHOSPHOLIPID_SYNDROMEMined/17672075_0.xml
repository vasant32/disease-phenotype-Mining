<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 60 APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 39) on antithrombotic therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>; group 2 (n = 21) on combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of the treatments was assessed by the number and frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> recurrences and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) while safety was evaluated by frequency and number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) were studied in 30 patients (25 females, 5 males) with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CYP2C9 gene genetic variants were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restrictase analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate was 19.6 per 100 man-day, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> rate was not less than 8 per 100 man-day, total rate of thrombotic complications (thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) before <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> individual dose adjustment--27.6 per 100 man-day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doses of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were adjusted and the patients on treatment were followed up for 15.7 months, on the average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this period <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 6 cases (7.6 per 100 man-day), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> also in 6 cases (7.6 per 100 man-day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This corresponded to thrombotic complications rate 15.1 per 100 man-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhages</z:mp> (major and minor) occurred in 19 (48.7%) patients of group 1 and in 13 (61.9%) patients of group 2 (p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total rate of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 carriage was 36.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CYP2C9*2 variant was detected in 7 (23.3%) patients, who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heterozygous carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The CYP2C9*3 variant was seen in 4 (13.3%) patients: 3 heterozygous and 1 homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Females of reproductive age with mutations had more frequent menorrhagies than carriers of a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with CYP2C9*3 had also more frequent nasal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000225'>gingival bleeding</z:hpo> (p = 0.005) compared to carriers of CYP2C9*1 and CYP2C9*2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Episodes of MHO rise &gt; 5.0 in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy were observed in 50% carriers of CYP2C9*3 and in none homozygous carriers of CYP2C9*1 (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CYP2C9*3 patients needed lower maintenance doses of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, in CYP2C9*1 and CYP2C9*2 patients <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> doses were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION; Efficacy of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for secondary prophylaxis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found similar to that of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use in combination with low-dose <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (MHO 2.0-3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Safety of monotherapy was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Determination of CYP2C9 genotype in APS patients before treatment with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> may help in planning individual policy and in reducing the risk of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> overdosage at the start of therapy </plain></SENT>
