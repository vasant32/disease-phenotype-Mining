<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-page questionnaire was prepared, divided into 4 parts: 1. personal data, 2. associated conditions, 3. biology (for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), 4. history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, haemorrhage and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every information was entered into a computerized registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IR-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> included 207 cases of idiopathic <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and 112 cases of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> secondary to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one out 207 (34.3%) and 47 out of 112 (42%) cases experienced arterial and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, respectively (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a thrombotic history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were experienced by 60.5% vs 57.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> by 26.7% vs 31.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the legs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> of the cerebral vessels were the most common types of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was present in 27.7% of idiopathic <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> vs 22.4% of secondary <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> (not significant) </plain></SENT>
