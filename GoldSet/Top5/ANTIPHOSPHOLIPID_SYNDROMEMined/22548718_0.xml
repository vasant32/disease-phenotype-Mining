<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 2004 and 2009, on the Department of Immunology in the Zala County Hospital, 100 female patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> (st)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> (if) (33/67), (mean age: 34.08 years) underwent, in addition to history taking and physical examination, an assessment by immune-serologic tests (ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA-Profile, anti-TPO, a-sperm, aCL, aPS, aβ2GP1, aANX, and aPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive aCL on two occasions could be demonstrated in 27/100 cases (27%) (st/if: 7/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them 4 cases of primary APS have been diagnosed respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 17 patients the clinical picture did not fulfil criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the twofold positive aCL, unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> including aβ2GP1, aPS or both were present in 1/27, 2/27 and 1/27 patients, as well as aANX and aPT in 3/26 and 1/27 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-time positive aCL occurred in 16/100 women (16%) (st/if: 5/11); among them aPT and aβ2GP1 could be detected in 1/16 patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the clinical picture, we raised the possibility of primary APS in 2/16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the aCL-negative women, we found the unusual antibodies of APS in 8/57 patients (14%) including positivity of aβ2GP1, aPS, aPT and aANX in 4/57, 4/57, 2/57 and 3/57 patients respectively; taking the clinical criteria of APS into consideration, primary APS could be stated in 2/57 patients of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 32 pregnancies developed in the follow-up period upon administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and maintenance dose low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), together with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> in patients with secondary APS, resulted in 23 deliveries and 5 miscarriages; 4 pregnancies are currently in progress </plain></SENT>
