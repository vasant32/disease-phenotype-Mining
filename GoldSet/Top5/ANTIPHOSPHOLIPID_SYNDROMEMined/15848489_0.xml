<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the clinical management of these high-risk patients on anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study period, 802 patients awaiting renal transplantation were screened for APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of these patients (3%) had APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 27, nine patients received cadaveric kidney transplants along with 409 patients who did not have APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients, seven were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> and the remaining two were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the seven patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi>, five did not have thrombotic complications posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, three of these patients were taken off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications at 6 months to 1 year posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> returned to dialysis shortly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients have maintained their allografts on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> therapy for 3 and 5 years posttransplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other two patients had posttransplant <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> within 24 hours of their transplant despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the two patients treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, one is doing well at 6 years posttransplant while the other had early allograft loss due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients with APAS may benefit from anticoagulation therapy; however, early allograft loss and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complication are two serious side effects of this therapy </plain></SENT>
