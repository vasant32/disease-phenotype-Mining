<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The pathogenic role of soluble endoglin (s-Eng), as an antiangiogenic protein, has largely been demonstrated in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess, in a cross-sectional study, plasma levels of s-Eng in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients and its relation with the disease characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma from 86 patients with SLE and 36 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects was assayed for s-Eng levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, autoantibodies and serological data were prospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by total SLE disease activity index score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our SLE patients, the levels of s-Eng were comparable between SLE patients and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these levels were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, s-Eng levels were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in our studied population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we did not find significant differences in mean plasma s-Eng levels in relation to disease activity, other organ system involvement or the presence of anti-dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data indicated the importance of s-Eng in a special subgroup of SLE patients associated with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional prospective, large-scale, longitudinal study should be carried out to support these findings </plain></SENT>
