<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human parvovirus B19 (B19) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> has been identified as a trigger of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of B19-VP1 unique region (VP1u) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgM and IgG against B19-VP, and serum levels of antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2GPI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PhL) were determined using ELISA in 45 APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Humoral responses of anti-B19-VP1u were assessed by Western blot and B19 DNA was detected by nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absorption experiments were performed using B19-VP1u protein to determine the binding specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One and 18 of 45 APS patients had detectable levels of anti-B19-VP IgM and anti-B19-VP IgG, indicating recent and past <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> serum samples from APS patients with diagnostic pattern DNA(-)/IgM(-)/IgG(+) had anti-B19-VP1u activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APS patients with anti-B19-VP1u antibody had a 4-fold increased risk for recurrent vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> compared with those without anti-B19-VP1u antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The binding inhibition of CL, beta2GPI, and PhL by absorption with B19-VP1u ranged from 31.4% to 91.1%, 0.8% to 59.8% and 20.2% to 72.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher inhibition to beta2GPI by B19-VP1u absorption was observed in APS patients with anti-B19-VP1u antibody than in those without anti-B19-VP1u antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show a close association of B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with aPL production and suggest B19-VP1u may be of pathogenetic importance in some patients with APS </plain></SENT>
