<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate if the presence of anti-beta 2GPI antibodies (a beta 2GPI) is associated with activated protein C resistance (APC-R) phenotype, we performed the APC-R APTT-based assay in 74 plasma samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Samples were diluted 1:5 in factor V-deficient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and a beta 2GPI (IgG and IgM) were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A control group of 22 healthy volunteers was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of reduced APC-R ratio in patients with aPL was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (31.1 vs 4.5%, P &lt; 0.05) and the mean APC-R ratio was lower (mean +/- SD; 2.32 +/- 0.40 vs 2.55 +/- 0.21, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the prevalence of APC-R and the ratio values between LA(+) and LA(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the LA(+), the aCL(+) had a higher prevalence of APC-R than the aCL(-) (P &lt; 0.01) and lower APC-R ratios (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter group was no different to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2GPI antibodies were associated with a higher prevalence of APC-R (50.0 vs 19.6%, P &lt; 0.001), and lower APC-R ratios (2.15 +/- 0.41 vs 2.42 +/- 0.35, P &lt; 0.005), compared with a beta 2GPI(-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the acquired APC-R in patients with aPL seems to be associated with aCL and a beta 2GPI rather than an in vitro interference by LA </plain></SENT>
