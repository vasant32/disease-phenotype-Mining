<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective survey of consecutive patients treated according to their physician's best judgment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Secondary and tertiary referral practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy patients (48 women [69%]) with a mean age (+/- SD) of 45.5 +/- 17.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was primary in 51 patients (73%) and secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> in 14 patients (20%) and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> in 5 patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Site of initial and recurrent thrombotic events (venous or arterial), as well as kind (aspiring, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) and intensity of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total follow-up after the first thrombotic event was 361.0 patient-years (mean [+/- SD], 5.2 +/- 5.6 years per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients (53%) had 54 recurrent events, with 2 patients experiencing fatal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial events were followed by arterial events, and venous events by venous events, in 49 of 54 instances (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rates during "no treatment;" aspirin therapy; or low-, intermediate-, or high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy (international normalized ratios [INRs] less than or equal to 1.9, 2.0 to 2.9, and greater than or equal to 3.0, respectively, or rabbit brain thromboplastin prothrombin time ratios of approximately less than 1.3, 1.3 to 1.5, and greater than 1.5, respectively) were 0.19, 0.32, 0.57, 0.07 (P = 0.12), and 0.00 (P less than 0.001) per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up periods for the five types of therapy were 161.2, 37.8, 11.3, 40.9, and 110.2 patient-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The highest INR coincident with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 2.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-treated patients had five significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events (0.031 per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>Recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> is a potentially serious problem for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anticardiolipin antibodies or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The site of the first event (arterial or venous) tended to predict the site of subsequent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Intermediate- to high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy may confer better antithrombotic protection than low- to intermediate-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy or aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to define more precisely the rethrombosis rate and optimal type, intensity, and duration of antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
