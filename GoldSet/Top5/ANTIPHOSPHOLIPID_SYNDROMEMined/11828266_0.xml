<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three patients (group A) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> were included in the study and tested for Factor V mutation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor II mutation</z:e>, 5-10 MTHFR reductase mutation and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of disorders was compared with thirty-six pregnancies without complications (control study, group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemostasis thrombophilic like disorders, were significantly high (p=0.001 vs group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nobody in both groups was homozygous for Leiden mutation or prothrombin mutation (Factor II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Factor V mutation in heterozygosis was significantly (p=0.01) higher in group A in comparison with group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR mutation in homozygosis was found in 21.4% of group A while in the control group it was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor II mutation</z:e> in heterozygosis and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies were found only in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is important to evaluate the hemocoagulation patterns in women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
