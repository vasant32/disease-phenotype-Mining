<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPLA) levels develop complications, the severity of these potential events mandates aggressive and extended lifelong anti-thrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-nine patients (57 patients with APS and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> [VTE], 32 patients with VTE without aPLA, 32 patients with aPLA only, and 8 healthy patients) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from peripheral-blood collection was used for DNA microarray analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patterns of gene expression that characterize APS as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the presence of aPLA were identified by hierarchical clustering and binary regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-expression profiles identify and predict individuals with APS from patients with VTE without aPLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, similar methods identified expression profiles that accurately predicted those patients with aPLA at high risk for thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> profiles were validated in independent cohorts of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability to predict APS, but more importantly, those patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, represents a paradigm for a genomic approach that can be applied to other populations of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, providing for more effective clinical management of disease, while also reflecting the possible underlying biologic processes </plain></SENT>
