<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Annexin A5 has been proposed to be important for shielding of negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> from blood, thereby preventing the binding of clotting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can disrupt the binding of annexin A5 from negatively <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-containing surfaces, resulting in uncontrolled coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If this hypothesis is correct, than the plasma levels of annexin A5 will be increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have measured plasma levels of annexin A5 of 175 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), of which 104 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and 23 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annexin A5 levels were compared with the annexin A5 plasma levels measured in 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 and 35 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significant increase of annexin A5 plasma levels in patients with SLE (median 6.7 ng mL(-1)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (median 7.1 ng mL(-1)) as compared to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2 (median 3.3 ng mL(-1)) and healthy volunteers (median 3.9 ng mL(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation was found with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or with a history of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we conclude that displacement of annexin A5 from cellular surfaces by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is not a common mechanism in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
