<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) of a specific IgG subclass is associated with clinical complications of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) and whether polymorphisms of Fc receptors for IgG (FcgammaR) with differential binding preferences contribute to an increased risk of thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 60 patients with IgG aCL, we assessed clinical complications of the APS, measured the level of antibody activity, and determined the IgG subclass distribution of aCL by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with murine anti-human IgG subclass monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective IgG subclass adsorption studies were performed to determine the relative contribution of specific IgG subclasses to overall aCL activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fcgamma receptor IIA (FcgammaRIIA) genotypes of aCL patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> controls were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and allele-specific probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG2 aCL, detected in 75% of the patients, was the major subclass of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selective adsorption studies demonstrated that IgG2, in contrast to IgG1, was the predominant subclass responsible for aCL reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG2 aCL was the only subclass associated with clinical complications, specifically, arterial and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of FcgammaRIIA-H131, a receptor expressed on platelets, monocytes, and endothelial cells and the only human FcgammaR which efficiently recognizes IgG2, was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in aCL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 45 high-titer (&gt;40 GPL [IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>] units) aCL patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 40% were homozygous for FcgammaRIIA-H131, compared with 25% of disease-free controls (P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 IgG subclasses are found in autoimmune aCL, only the presence of IgG2 is significantly associated with thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reactivity in aCL ELISA is largely due to the presence of IgG2 in high-titer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of IgG2 aCL, particularly in association with FcgammaRIIA-H131, may be a useful clinical predictor of increased thrombotic risk in patients with autoimmune IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Allelic variants of FcgammaRIIA with distinct capacities to interact with IgG subclasses provide a mechanism for genetic susceptibility to an autoantibody-induced prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
