<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIG)-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in kidney transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: Both cases involved female patients presenting to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit for renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, positive for both anticardiolipin and anti-DNA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2, postnephrectomy, was found to have moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, with a total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level of 3.9 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients were considered highly sensitized and at high risk for rejection due to the presence of either high panel reactive antibody or a positive B cell flow cytometry crossmatch, in addition to other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IVIG was considered a viable treatment option to be included in induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IVIG was administered both peri- and postoperatively, and both patients experienced immediate graft function with good urine output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours following transplantation, elevations in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and decreases in urine output were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, kidney exploration was performed and palpable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in renal arteries and veins were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediate nephrectomy was performed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Currently, evidence derived from case reports highlights numerous risk factors for IVIG-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one of which appears to be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported that some IVIG products contain amounts of anticardiolipin antibodies; these antibodies may potentiate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these 2 patients, the Naranjo probability scale indicated that there was a possible association between the thrombotic events and the use of IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prospective trials evaluating the safety of IVIG in highly sensitized transplant patients are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is imperative that the benefits and risks be weighed when considering the use of IVIG in highly sensitized transplant patients </plain></SENT>
