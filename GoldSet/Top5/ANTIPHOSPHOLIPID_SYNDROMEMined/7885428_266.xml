<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is a thrombophilic disorder in which venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, or both, may occur in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment of these patients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, low-dose aspirin, or both in the secondary prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-seven patients (124 [84 percent] of whom were female) with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The syndrome was primary in 62 patients and was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> in 66 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease in 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each patient's history was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred one patients (69 percent) had a total of 186 recurrences of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time between the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the first recurrence was 12 months (range, 0.5 to 144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (producing an international normalized ratio of &gt; or = 3) with or without low-dose aspirin (75 mg per day) was significantly more effective (P &lt; 0.001 by the log-rank test) than treatment with low-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (producing an international normalized ratio of &lt; 3) with or without low-dose aspirin or treatment with aspirin alone in preventing further thrombotic events (recurrence rates per patient-year, 0.013, 0.23, and 0.18, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was highest (1.30 per patient-year) during the first six months after the cessation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications involving <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 29 patients during <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy and were severe in 7 (0.071 and 0.017 occurrence per patient-year, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term anticoagulation therapy in which the international normalized ratio is maintained at or above 3 is advisable in these patients </plain></SENT>
