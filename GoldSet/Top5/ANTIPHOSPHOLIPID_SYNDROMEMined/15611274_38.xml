<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our studies in a murine model of APS induced by passive transfer of human aPL Abs have shown that activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils into decidua are required for fetal loss, and emphasize the importance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in aPL Ab-induced pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the role of TNF-alpha in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> associated with aPL Abs in a murine model of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that aPL Abs are specifically targeted to decidual tissue and cause a rapid increase in decidual and systemic TNF-alpha levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identify the release of TNF-alpha as a critical intermediate that acts downstream of C5 activation, based on the fetal protective effects of TNF-alpha deficiency and TNF blockade and on the absence of increased TNF-alpha levels in C5-deficient mice treated with aPL Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TNF-alpha links pathogenic aPL Abs to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal damage</z:e> and identify TNF blockade as a potential therapy for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> of APS </plain></SENT>
