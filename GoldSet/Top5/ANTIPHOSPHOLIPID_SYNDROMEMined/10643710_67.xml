<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> IgG from women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI)-independent IgG aPL human monoclonal antibody (mAb) (519), and IgM anti-beta2GPI human mAb (TMIG2) were investigated for their binding to trophoblasts cultured for various amounts of time, their ability to affect invasiveness of Matrigel-coated filters, and their release of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Polyclonal IgG aPL, as well as mAb 519 and TMIG2, bound to trophoblasts, the highest binding being found when cells displayed the greatest amount of syncytium formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TM1G2 binding was found to be betaGPI dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both polyclonal and monoclonal aPL, but not the controls, significantly reduced hCG release and Matrigel invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that aPL recognition of both anionic PL and adhered beta2GPI on trophoblast cell structures might represent a potential pathogenetic mechanism for defective placentation in women with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
