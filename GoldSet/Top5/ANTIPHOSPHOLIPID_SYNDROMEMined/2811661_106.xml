<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five hundred consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were entered into a prospective study of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) in their 3 major immunoglobulin isotypes and followed thereafter with repeated testing for a mean period of nearly 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of SLE that were strongly associated with ACLA included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (particularly when recurrent), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, recurrent fetal loss, and leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations found to be associated with ACLA were <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we found no relationship between ACLA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> of bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between the presence of ACLA and that of anti-DNA antibodies studied in the same serum sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association with ACLA grew stronger and titers became higher in patients with several of the associated manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses revealed the existence of a syndrome, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, comprising 2 or more manifestations in conjunction with ACLA titers 5 standard deviations above the mean of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, particularly if ACLA had been positive on at least 2 occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that such criteria could be applied to the definition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence and the titers of these antibodies related to disease activity and titer decreased by treatment, particularly when they were of the IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom a thrombotic episode occurred during the course of the study were observed to have a coincident decrease in ACLA titers, a finding that might indicate consumption of the antibody during the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment and the resulting inactivation of disease appear to have independent effects on ACLA titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physicians should therefore be cautious in prescribing high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> to patients with SLE solely because they have high titers of ACLA </plain></SENT>
