<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histopathology of 47 placentae from 45 women with intra-uterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, including 16 patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, was studied in order to detect potential differences between placentae from women with and without these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease, including 6 women with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In placentae from patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, a decrease in vasculo-syncytial membranes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> mainly in infarcted areas, hypovascular villi and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or infarction was seen significantly more often than in placentae from women without these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 17 placentae from 16 patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, only 3 did not demonstrate signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>/infarction was significantly associated with a decrease in vasculo-syncytial membranes, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, hypovascular villi and an increase in syncytial knots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are most likely to be the result of prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or infarctions are prominent features in placenta from patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies and intra-uterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
