<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included 62 patients (sex ratio F/M = 1.48; mean age 43.4 +/- 23.6 years) with diagnosis of MS according to Poser criteria and 31 control subjects (sex ratio F/M = 9.3, mean age 37 +/- 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the level of antibodies against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (anticardiolipid, anti beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 and antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies), antinuclear, anti native DNA, antiprothrombinase antibodies and rheumatoid factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were found with a significant level (anticardiolipid &gt; 30 UI, anti beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 positive) in only five patients (8%) with MS; two others showed an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (1/320 degrees and 1/1280 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast with data recently reported, this study failed to find a significant level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result argues for the existence of different pathogenic mechanisms in MS and AS </plain></SENT>
