<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe 3 relatively young patients who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> in a limb requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one, these appeared as part of the clinical and serologic spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and in the other 2 as a component of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their arterial angiograms showed gradual narrowing of the arterial lumen and the histopathologic study showed striking intimal and medial proliferation as well as some increase in thickness of the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but in the 2 patients who were amputated early there was mononuclear cell infiltrate of the large arteries and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 there was also leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0200029'>vasculitis in the skin</z:hpo> and/or muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe this represents a new form of vasculopathy, probably related to the presence of APLA, possibly triggered by the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
