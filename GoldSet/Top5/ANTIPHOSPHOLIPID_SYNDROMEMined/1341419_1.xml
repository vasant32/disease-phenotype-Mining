<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anemia</z:hpo> with cryoagglutinins, in whom antibodies eluted from red blood cells (RBC) displayed anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This activity was confined to the IgG isotype and was directed to the negatively-charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patient's IgG fraction displayed a higher binding to RBC in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control IgG and this reactivity was inhibited after absorption of the anti-CL activity with CL-micelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings further sustain the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) and Coombs' positivity with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and suggest that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> could be at least in part responsible for anti-RBC activity </plain></SENT>
