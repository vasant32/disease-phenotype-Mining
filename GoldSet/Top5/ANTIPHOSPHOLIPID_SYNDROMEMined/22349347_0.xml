<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies directed against the β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (β(2)GP-I) are known as the best markers for diagnosis of APS, however, detection of such antibodies is still a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of β(2)GP-I are exposed upon binding to negatively charged membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surface of the sensor chips was therefore modified with such type of membranes, on which β(2)GP-I molecules were subsequently immobilized as recognition elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the label-free method, reflectometric interference spectroscopy, it was possible to quantify anti-β(2)GP-I antibodies and to calibrate the sensor chip in buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mild regeneration procedure allows for many consecutive measurements without stripping off the membrane in between </plain></SENT>
