<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPA) to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) requires the presence of certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins, eg, beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found a requirement for plasma against the electrically neutral or zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of these PE-binding plasma proteins were identified as high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied anti-PE antibody (aPE) seropositive plasma from 13 patients with SLE and/or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> by using partially purified kininogens and kininogen binding proteins from adult bovine serum isolated by carboxymethyl (CM)-papain affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 13 sera recognized a kininogen-PE complex and/or a kininogen-binding protein-kininogen-PE complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some aPE-positive patient sera were shown to recognize highly purified HMWK and LMWK by ELISA only when the kininogens were presented on a PE substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These aPE sera did not recognize PE, HMWK, or LMWK when they were presented independently as the sole antigens on the ELISA plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other aPE-positive sera that did not react with PE-bound HMWK or LMWK reacted with the CM-papain column eluate when it was bound to PE, which suggests that these aPE recognize factor XI or prekallikrein, which normally bind to HMWK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aPE ELISA reactivity of two patient sera were inhibited by preincubation of the CM-papain column eluate in the ELISA plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that most aPE are not specific for PE but require the presence of certain PL-binding plasma proteins that are kininogens or proteins in complex with kininogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that aPE bind to different plasma proteins than those implicated in anionic PL, aPA ELISA reactivity </plain></SENT>
