<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish an indirect immunofluorescent test so as to improve the sensitivity and specificity of examination of antibodies to beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Full-length beta(2)GP cDNA was obtained from human hepatocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell line HepG2 by RT-PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recombinant plasmid pEGFP-beta(2)GP was transfected into HEp-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, immunoblotting (IBT), confocal fluorescence microscopy, and indirect immunofluorescent test (IIF) were used to confirm the expression, localization, and antigenicity of fusion protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum specimens from 19 patients suspected as with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), 1 patient diagnosed as with primary APS, and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons were detected with IIF-IgG-beta(2)GP1, ELISA-IgG-ACL, and ELISA-IgG-beta(2)GP I simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The HEp-beta(2)GP I cells thus obtained retained their ability of expression of beta(2)GP-I-GFP for more than ten generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This beta(2)GP-I-GFP showed the antigenicity of beta(2)GP-I with a characteristic feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) Seven of the 20 serum specimens from APS patients showed characteristic immunofluorescent pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No serum specimen from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons showed immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison of results of the three methods showed that the concordance between IIF-IgG-beta(2)GP I and ELISA-IgG-beta(2)GP I was the most perfect (Kappa = 0.886) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(3) HEp-beta(2)GP I retained the immunofluorescent property of HEp-2 cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As a new kind of substrate of IIF, beta(2)GP I transfectant can be used to detect anti-beta(2)GP-I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transfeted HEp-2 cells keep the immunofluorescent property of HEp-2 cells in IFANA test and can be used as substrate for routine IFANA detection </plain></SENT>
