<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics of patients with CH-C seropositive for anti-CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-CL and clinical parameters associated with anti-CL in those patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the 45 (13%) patients with CH-C had anti-CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, none of these six CH-C patients fulfilled the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (ApoB) levels in CH-C patients with anti-CL were significantly higher than those in CH-C patients without anti-CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels positively correlated with serum ApoB levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CH-C patients with anti-CL had significantly more progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001395'>hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo> than those without anti-CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of 8-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17172">2'-deoxyguanosine</z:chebi> (8-OHdG) expression in the liver tissue was more severe in CH-C patients with anti-CL than in those without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the emergence of anti-CL in CH-C patients was independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the emergence of anti-CL is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and that CH-C patients seropositive for anti-CL have clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, which derives from the facilitation of ApoB synthesis, and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001395'>hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
