<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of beta 2GPI binding to PL mixtures coated on <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> microtiter wells (MTW) and to large, multilamellar PL vesicles (LMV) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors included phosphorylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35381">monosaccharide</z:chebi> metabolites, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25446">myo-inositol monophosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>), hexaphosphate (IHP) and hexasulfate (IHS), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18361">PPi</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> bisphosphonate (MBP) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16215,26066">phosphonate</z:chebi>, and a series of carboxylic and aromatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29214">sulfonic acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors were incubated with beta 2GPI at 37 degrees C for 2 hr either with dimyristoylphosphatidic acid, 80%/dimyristoylphosphatidyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, 20% (DMPA/DMPC) coated on MTW or in a suspension of LMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">Phospholipid</z:chebi>-bound beta 2GPI to PA/PC on MTW was detected using an immunoassay based on rabbit anti-beta 2GPI; free beta 2GPI (not bound to LMV) was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition was studied over the range 0.01-9.0 mumoles/10(-4)L (0.1-90 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition at maximum concentration in the MTW system ranged from 0.1% (for <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) to &gt; 94% (for IHP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IHP also provided the greatest inhibition in the LMV system (76%) and was also effective in displacing beta 2GPI already bound to PL surfaces (approximately 50% displaced at 0.25 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a strategy for development of therapeutic agents for APS may be based on the use of small cyclic, organic oligoanions such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> derivatives to act as ligands for lysine residues at the PL binding site of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
