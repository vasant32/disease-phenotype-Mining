<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPS) have previously been demonstrated to have inhibitory activity against tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the development of a prothrombotic state by impaired regulation of the tissue factor (TF) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect that IgG fractions from aPS subjects containing anti-TFPI activity have on in vitro TF-induced thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: TFPI and anti-TFPI activities were determined in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n=29) and aPS subjects (n=57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TFPI activity was determined using an amidolytic assay based on the generation of factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-TFPI activity was determined after incubating IgG isolated from a control or subject plasma with pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma, using the TFPI activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of IgG fractions from controls (n=10) and subjects (n=23) on TF-induced in vitro thrombin generation was determined using a chromogenic assay of thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TFPI activity in controls (1.13+/-0.25 U/mL) was significantly lower than in subjects (1.30+/-0.42 U/mL) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-TFPI activity was significantly higher in subjects than controls (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TF-induced thrombin generation was positively associated with anti-TFPI activity (r = 0.356; p &gt; 0.05), with increased levels of each demonstrated in 5 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TFPI activity was confirmed in 65% of aPS subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IgG fractions demonstrated a variable ability to interfere with TFPI function and TF-induced thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cross-reacting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and/or other entities may interfere with TFPI function, resulting in a net increase in thrombin generation and an increased thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
