<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven consecutive successful pregnancies in 26 SLE patients and 28 pregnancies in 28 matched healthy subjects, as controls, were enrolled and prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera obtained at first and third trimesters of pregnancy were tested for IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, INF-γ, and TNF-α with a highly sensitive, multiplexed sandwich ELISA (SearchLight Human Inflammatory Cytokine Array) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistics were performed by SPSS package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-8 serum levels were higher in the first (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and third (P=0.003) trimesters of pregnancy in SLE patients compared with controls, INF-γ serum levels in the third trimester (P=0.009), and IL-10 serum levels in the first and third trimesters (P=0.055 and P&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-2 (r=0.524 P=0.010), IL-12 (r=0.549 P=0.007), IFN-γ (r=0.492 P=0.017), and IL-6 (r=0.515 P=0.020) serum levels correlated with disease activity in SLE patients in the first trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytokine profile was similar in patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> both in the first and in the third trimesters of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-8 serum levels were lower in patients with a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome compared with those without, both in the first and in the third trimesters of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SLE patients, a lower than expected decrease in Th1 cytokine serum levels was observed in the third trimester of gestation which could contribute to a lower Th2 cytokine polarization during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
