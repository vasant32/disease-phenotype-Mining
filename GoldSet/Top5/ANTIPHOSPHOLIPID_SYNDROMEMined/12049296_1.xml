<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty three patients with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> diagnosed before pregnancy and subdivided into primary (18) and secondary (25) subgroups were closely monitored <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> through pregnancy with serial blood tests and ultrasonography until the pregnancy ended in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> or delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with low-dose aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and or steroids and IV Ig given to some selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maternal and fetal outcomes were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients in the primary subgroup (24.60 +/- 4.30) years was significantly lower than the mean age of the secondary recurrent pregnancy loss group (31.50 +/- 4.50) years, (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>85.00% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> were in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of live births in the primary (77.80%) and secondary (84.00%) groups, (p &gt; 0.05); the babies were of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of caesarean section in the primary and secondary groups, 22.23% and 12.00% respectively, were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin added to the standard therapy resulted in 100% live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maternal complications were negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The fetal and maternal outcome of pregnancies in patients with primary and secondary recurrent pregnancy loss associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were virtually identical and quite satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin added to the standard therapy resulted in excellent fetal and maternal outcome, although its definitive role will have to wait for the outcome of randomised trials </plain></SENT>
