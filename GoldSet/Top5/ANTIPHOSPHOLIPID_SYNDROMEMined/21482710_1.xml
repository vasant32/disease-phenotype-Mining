<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of APLAs are directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins, particularly β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β₂GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-β₂GPI antibodies activate endothelial cells in a β₂GPI-dependent manner through a pathway that involves NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) play a critical role in regulating the endothelial response to inflammatory stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that activation of endothelial cells by APLA/anti-β₂GPI antibodies might be associated with decreased expression of KLFs, which in turn might facilitate cellular activation mediated through NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experimental results confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating markedly decreased expression of KLF2 and KLF4 after incubation of cells with APLA/anti-β₂GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration of KLF2 or KLF4 levels inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity and blocked APLA/anti-β₂GPI-mediated endothelial activation despite NF-κB p65 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity by KLFs reflects sequestration of the cotranscriptional activator CBP/p300, making this cofactor unavailable to NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the endothelial response to APLA/anti-β₂GPI antibodies reflects competition between KLFs and NF-κB for their common cofactor, CBP/p300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations are the first to implicate the KLFs as novel participants in the endothelial proinflammatory response to APLA/anti-β₂GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
