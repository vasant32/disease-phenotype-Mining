<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mice produce not only anti-DNA antibodies but also anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo>, resulting in decreased platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They show a high level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> due to the high levels of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When W/BF1 mice (4-5 months) were lethally irradiated and then reconstituted with T cell-depleted bone marrow cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BALB/c mice (8 weeks), 60% of the mice survived more than one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The WBC and platelet counts in the mice were normalized, and the levels of anti-DNA and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> was also ameliorated as indicated by a lower level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, lower levels of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (S-CRTN) and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN), and by improved histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure (BP) of the treated W/BF1 mice decreased due to the improved renal functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the non-treated W/BF1 mice which died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> by the age of 7 months, the treated W/BF1 mice showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> even one year after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was due to the lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
