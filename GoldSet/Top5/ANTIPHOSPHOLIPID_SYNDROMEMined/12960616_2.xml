<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> required lepirudin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had an abnormal baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), complicating management of his therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether an alternative monitoring system, using a dry reagent technology [Thrombolytic Assessment System (TAS)], could be used to monitor the patient's whole blood ecarin clot time (ECT) and aPTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline values for the ECT and aPTT were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a continuous infusion of lepirudin, the patient's whole blood ECT was maintained between a desired range of 150-200 s for 73% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, his whole blood aPTT was maintained between 60 and 80 s for 80% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the patient's plasma-based aPTT by standard methods was consistently &gt; 150 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent surgical procedures without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the finding that the patient's antibody did not affect the aPTT with this system, we performed the ECT and the aPTT assays on the TAS Analyzer with plasma samples from 10 patients with APS and abnormal aPTTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 samples had plasma ECT values within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had normalization of the aPTT, suggesting that a subset of patients with APS may benefit from the TAS aPTT assay when monitoring <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or other anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
