<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> was described for patients with elevated coagulation factor VIII, but it is unknown whether there is also an association to early pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated the relation between recurrent early pregnancy loss and levels of coagulation factor VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 49 unrelated Caucasian women with a history of 2-6 early pregnancy losses and 48 healthy controls, who had delivered at least one term infant and had never experienced pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined factor V Leiden-, G20210A prothrombin-, MTHFR C677T- and A1298C-gene mutations, levels of antithrombin, protein C, protein S, factor VIII, C-reactive protein and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher rate of pregnancy losses in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII were significantly higher in cases than in controls (130.5 IU/dl +/- 25.4 vs 119.5 IU/dl +/- 24.1; p = 0.032) and appeared independent of C-reactive protein (R = 0.146, p = 0.323 in cases; R = -0.028, p = 0.850 in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for recurrent pregnancy loss in women with factor VIII levels above 151 IU/dl (90(th) percentile of controls) was 2.5 (0.7 - 8.9, 95 percent confidence interval), for levels above 156 IU/dl (95(th) percentile of controls) 3.9 (0.8 - 20.0, 95 percent confidence interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated maternal plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII tend to be associated with an increased risk for recurrent early pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
