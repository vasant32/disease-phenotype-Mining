<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventeen patients were entered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They consisted of 133 patients with SLE, 60 with RA, 45 with SSc, 37 with PM, 23 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e> (overlap), and 19 with unclassified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> (UCTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL were examined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While IgG beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL were detected in 13% of patients with SLE, these aCL were positive in two patients with SSc, two with overlap and 14 with UCTD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association between IgG beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations were studied in 32 patients with secondary APS based on SLE and 14 with primary APS (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence of malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disorder</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, immunological disorders and hypocomplementemia were significantly less frequent in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PAPS and in 34% of secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that IgG beta 2-dependent aCL are useful for identifying a subset in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
