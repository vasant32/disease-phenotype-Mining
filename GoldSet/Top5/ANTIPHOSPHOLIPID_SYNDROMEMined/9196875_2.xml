<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our two patients had "primary" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome without underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or other systemic autoimmune process, as well as symptomatic immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> did not respond to prolonged courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or immune globulin infusions, but was controlled following splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of serum antibodies to platelet surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, typical of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, could be helpful in the confirmation of both of these disorders in the same patient, rather than secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of such cases is confounded by an increased risk for both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, including fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To reduce the risk of fetal loss and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, both patients were advised to take aspirin 80 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency and clinical significance of this association would suggest that patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> should be tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, particularly before pregnancy or surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome would be at increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the post-operative period following splenectomy and should be given prophylactic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
