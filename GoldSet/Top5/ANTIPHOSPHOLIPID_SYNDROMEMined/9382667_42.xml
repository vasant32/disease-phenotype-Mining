<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>Recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> has particularly adverse effects on patients prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factors that influence recurrence and management techniques that prevent these events remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To add further insight regarding predisposing factors and the prevention of thrombotic recurrence, 61 well-characterized patients with APS were followed up for a median time of 77 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in which the following factors were examined to determine their influence on thrombotic recurrence: primary vs secondary syndrome; the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or smoking; patient age, sex, and race; pregnancy and oral contraceptives use; and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">warfarin sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> plus aspirin, aspirin alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, or no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference between patients with primary and secondary APS with respect to recurrent arterial (55% vs 38%, respectively) or recurrent venous (47% vs 50%, respectively) thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with APS, white race (P = .02) was associated with recurrent arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred during pregnancy or in the postpartum period in 16 (30%) of 53 women and in 8 women taking oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent arterial and venous thromboses were significantly decreased with prophylactic <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use when compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> use or no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrences were infrequent in patients with prothrombin ratios of 1.5 to 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was most effective in preventing recurrent arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> may also influence recurrence </plain></SENT>
