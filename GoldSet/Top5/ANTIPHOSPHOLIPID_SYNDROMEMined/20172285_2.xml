<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transplant-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) is a well-recognized complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its known relationship with immunosuppressive therapy, only a few cases have been reported following intestinal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical files of nine consecutive intestinal transplant patients between 2000 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> was established in 3 patients (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis the immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus (n = 3), combined with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (n = 1) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> (n = 2) and steroids (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time between transplantation and <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> was 104 days (range, 55-167 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of ADAMTS13, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> protease, were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of stopping/tapering of tacrolimus, together with initiation of plasma therapy, leading to complete remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During further follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients showed severe graft rejection necessitating more profound immunosuppressive therapy, leading to graft loss in 1 patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the 2 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 52 months (range, 9-100 months) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-free patients (n = 6) were alive with functioning grafts under minimal immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Herein we have described 3 intestinal transplant patients who were diagnosed with transplantation-related <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite excellent disease control the final outcomes were dismal, which clearly contrasts with the outcome among <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>-free patients, who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> well with functioning grafts at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
