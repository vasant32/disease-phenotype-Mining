<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study circulating platelet, monocyte and endothelial microparticles (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi>, MMPs and EMPs) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in comparison with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-two patients with APS and 52 healthy controls were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MPs were measured on a flow cytometer (Beckman Gallios) and defined as particles sized &lt; 1.0 Âµm, negative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8040">phalloidin</z:chebi>, positive to lactadherin and positive to either CD42a (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi>), CD144 (EMPs) or CD14 (MMPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of CD142 (TF) was measured on CD144 positive MPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total number of MPs (i.e. lactadherin positive particles) was higher in APS patients versus controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increased number of EMPs (p &lt; 0.001), increased TF-positive EMPs (p &lt; 0.001) and increased MMPs (p &lt; 0.001) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> numbers did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the MP types differed in numbers between obstetric and thrombotic APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We observed a high number of EMPs expressing TF in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The numbers of MMPs and total EMPs were also higher as compared with healthy controls but in contrast to previous reports, the number of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
