<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present five patients who were found to have had an MI without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had aPL antibodies and thus fulfilled the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Who did not have recurrent events on long-term anticoagulation maintaining an international normalised ratio of 3-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that APS is probably a major cause of MI in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is an important diagnosis to make as they do not require anti-atherosclerotic treatment but appear, from this case series, to do well on high-dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further clinical studies are necessary to look at prevalence and best management in these patients </plain></SENT>
