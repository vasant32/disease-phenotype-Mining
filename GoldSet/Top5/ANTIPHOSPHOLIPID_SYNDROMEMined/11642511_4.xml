<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a previous study we described the direct pathogenic effects of IgG aCL on living neurons in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the IgG aCL titre as a factor influencing the extent of this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were grouped according to their IgG aCL titre into low positive (GPL &lt; or = 40), high positive (40&lt; GPL &lt;100) and very high positive (GPL &gt;100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG from these patients were incubated with cerebellar neurons in primary culture for 24h and the effect was evaluated by using the tetrazolium salt (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' IgGs reduced cell viability in vitro, but the differences in the extent of the effect were statistically significant only for patients with &gt;40 GPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results reinforce the causal association between increasing level of IgG aCL and clinical features of aPS </plain></SENT>
