<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of human monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) on platelet interaction with the subendothelium under flow conditions and on tissue factor (TF) expression on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three monoclonal IgM aCL (TM1B3, GR1D5, and EY2C9) and 2 affinity-purified IgM aCL were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulins were added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood and perfused through chambers containing denuded vascular segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet interactions were morphometrically evaluated by determining the percentage of total surface covered by platelets (PCS) or by large aggregates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> platelets (TP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of TF on monocytes was measured after immunoglobulin incubation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant increases in the total PCS and expression of TF were observed using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of TP were induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aCL except EY2C9 (obtained from a patient without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous incubations of these aCL with subendothelial surfaces did not increase platelet interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The effects of aCL on platelet function may help to explain the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
