<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs in 0.3% of pregnant women, while 1% of them have two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of biphospholipid antibodies in pregnant women with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 60 pregnant women who had two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group included 60 healthy pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed titres of anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and/or IgM with high titres (&gt; 20 U/mL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) antibodies and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein (b2-GP1) IgG as well as parameters of coagulation status of pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyzing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in a group of affected patients, we noticed a slightly positive correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LAC) with aCL antibodies of both classes, while the correlation with b2GP1 IgG was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both classes of aCL antibodies and anti-b2GP1 IgG were in a discrete positive correlation with the given variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group, there was a lack of consistency in correlation of the study variables with LAC-aCl IgG, compared to the affected patients, and there was a standard negative coefficient of correlation with anti-b2GP1 IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation ratio of anti-b2GP1 IgG was negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied test parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of hemostatic parameters showed a statistically significant difference in the concentration of fibrinogen (p &lt; 0.01) and thrombocyte count (p &lt; 0.05) between the study and the control group of pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower mean values of fibrinogen (2.90 +/- 0.45 g/L) and lower thrombocyte count [(179.20 +/- 6.00) x 10(9)] were found in the study group of pregnant women with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> compared to the mean values of fibrinogen (3.60 +/- 0.55 g/L) and thrombocyte count [(236.05 +/- 5.10) x 10(9)] in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were statistically significantly prolonged (p &lt; 0.05) in pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> compared to controls, suggest <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> compared to healthy pregnant women slightly positive correlation of LAC with aCL antibodies of both classes, as well as a positive correlation of aCL antibodies with anti-b2GP1 IgG exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, hemostatic parameters values suggest an anticoagulatnt status in the blood of pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
