<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency of anti-prothrombin Ab in sAPS, pAPS and patients without APS-related symptoms were found to be 50.0, 37.5 and 22.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a total of 72 anti-prothrombin-positive samples, 12.5% were specific for pure prothrombin, 31.9% for phosphatidylserine/prothrombin-complexes and 55.6% recognized both antigenic forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of other anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Ab was observed in 84% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both types of anti-prothrombin Ab are significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, but only Ab to pure prothrombin display such a relationship to clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, it cannot be recommended at present to include anti-prothrombin assays in the routine procedure for the serodiagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and typical APS-related anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Ab should be tested for anti-prothrombin reactivity, favoring, mainly due to its higher specificity, the ELISA containing pure prothrombin as antigen </plain></SENT>
