<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A solid-state surface with covalently bound ω-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-functionalized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was established and the binding of β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2-GPI) was investigated either by use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, by electrically switchable DNA interfaces (switchSENSE) and by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STM could clearly visualize the attachment of β2-GPI to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the switchSENSE sensor, β2-GPI as specific ligand could be identified by increased hydrodynamic friction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL) was detected against the ω-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-functionalized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-modified SPR biosensor (aCL biosensor) using sera from healthy donors, APS patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the aCL biosensor is a much more sensitive diagnostic device for APS patients compared to previous methods </plain></SENT>
