<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is the most frequent cause of venous and arterial thrombotic events in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brain arterial tree is primarily affected, but coronary ischemic manifestations are also relatively frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronary involvement was suggested to be closely related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> linked to the underlying disease in APS associated to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, in particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, arterial ischemic events can occur in primary APS--with no other systemic disorders--even in the absence of traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a biological point of view, this finding speaks in favor for a pro-coagulant activity of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies rather than for their role in atherosclerotic plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the clinical challenge is to avoid the risk to misdiagnose young patients with potentially life-threatening symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, the occurrence of nonspecific symptoms related to coronary ischemic events is frequently misdiagnosed because of its rarity in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This issue is well illuminated by two cases of MI in young patients reported in the manuscript together with a systematic review of the associations and implications of coronary ischemic events in APS </plain></SENT>
