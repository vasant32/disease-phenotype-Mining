<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed on beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite a good correlation between standard ACA assays and those using purified human beta2GPI as the sole antigen, some sera from APS patients only react in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize their reactivity profiles, human and bovine beta2GPI were immobilized on gamma-irradiated plates (beta2GPI-ELISA), plain <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> precoated with increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> concentrations (CL/beta2GPI-ELISA), and affinity columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluid-phase inhibition experiments were also carried out with both proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 56 selected sera, restricted recognition of bovine or human beta2GPI occurred respectively in 10/29 IgA-positive and 9/22 IgM-positive samples, and most of the latter (8/9) were missed by the standard ACA assay, as expected from a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on species specificity and ACA results, IgG-positive samples (53/56) were categorized into three groups: antibodies reactive to bovine beta2GPI only (group I) or to bovine and human beta2GPI, group II being ACA-negative, and group III being ACA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important group, group III (n = 33) was characterized by (i) binding when beta2GPI was immobilized on gamma-irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> at sufficient concentration (regardless of beta2GPI density, as assessed using 125I-beta2GPI); (ii) and low avidity binding to fluid-phase beta2GPI (Kd in the range 10(-5) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six group II samples showed (i) ability to bind human and bovine beta2GPI immobilized on non-irradiated plates; (ii) concentration-dependent blockade of binding by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, suggesting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> location in the vicinity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site on native beta2GPI; (iii) and relative avidities approximately 100-fold higher than in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group I patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to CL/beta2GPI-ELISA and ACA results (6/14 scored negative), possibly reflecting antibody differences in terms of avidity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Affinity fractionation of 23 sera showed the existence, in individual patients, of various combinations of antibody subsets solely reactive to human or bovine beta2GPI, together with cross-species reactive subsets present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples with dual reactivity namely groups III and II, although the latter antibodies were poorly purified on either column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the mode of presentation of beta2GPI greatly influences its recognition by anti-beta2GPI antibodies with marked inter-individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, in relation to ACA quantitation and, possibly, disease presentation and pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
