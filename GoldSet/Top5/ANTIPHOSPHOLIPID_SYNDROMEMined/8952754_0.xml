<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antigenic targets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependent antibodies were studied on plasmas from 38 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and presenting aPLA and/or LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using human beta 2-GPI-PLP complexes as solid phase antigen offers the highest sensitivity for measuring aPLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many aPLA, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, also react with beta 2-GPI coated on solid phase, however there is no evidence until now that this latter reactivity shows a closest association with the clinical context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with LA present an immunological reactivity to beta 2-GPI alone or to prothrombin, when these proteins are coated on solid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two cases there was a reactivity to only beta 2-GPI-PLP complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the various immunoassays, using NUNC type I plates offers a good binding capacity for coating antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They are then present at enough density on solid phase for insuring an efficient binding of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is an important factor for assay sensitivity and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in 1 case with LA, autoantibodies were reactive with coated beta 2-GPI alone but not with its PLP-complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In another case reactivity to beta 2-GPI was much higher than that to beta 2-GPI-PLP </plain></SENT>
