<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fraxiparine was administered after the detection of significant changes (not less than 5%) of densitometric parameters characteristic of the state of brain tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such differences the authors called the signs of "densitometric parameters lateralization" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the lateralization of X-ray density and its extent, though did not correspond to the severity of clinical presentations of the disease, completely vanished or decreased to the statistically non-significant differences after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapy with fraxiparine significantly increased the blood flow through the brain tissue that was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylactic dosages of fraxiparine improvef the brain microcirculation and reduced the "capillary" <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> that correlated with dynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> specific to the initial signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
