<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is characterized by the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and occlusive vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ocular vascular damage is described in the literature and may reveal the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It's diagnosis is important because this disease, which generally affects young people, may endanger ocular and vital prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two cases are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two young people aged 22 and 32 presented with a sudden unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, fundus examination and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography revealed a severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For one patient, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was discovered during etiological check-up. for the second one, it was associated with a heterozygote state mutation of Leiden V factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases the visual function of the affected eye was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In most cases central artery or vein occlusion means <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, other etiologies must be studied in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to several studies: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> has been detected in 5% to 33% of the patients showing a major vascular <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> must be considered because it increases the risk of thrombotic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> must be studied in cases of numerous and severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> occurring in young patients, even if vascular risks exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis is important because it may imply a long-lasting anticoagulative or an antiaggregative treatment to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
