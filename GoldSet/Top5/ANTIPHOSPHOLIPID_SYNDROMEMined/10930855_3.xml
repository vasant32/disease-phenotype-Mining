<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We conducted a prospective study to determine the prevalence of activated protein C resistance and anticardiolipin antibodies in leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, whatever venous, arterial or arteriovenous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients hospitalized for leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were studied by clinical examination, Doppler, duplex Doppler and, when required, arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance was isolated by a "classic" test (normalized APTT ratio in PCa presence or absence) and by a "second generation test" (by preliminary dilution with deficient factor V plasma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with abnormal results on the second test were screened for the factor V Leiden (by PCR amplication with use of restriction enzymes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were investigated with an ELISA method with Harris standards as reference, in which the positive threshold was established at 20 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among these 115 patients, 50 venous (43.5 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>100), 23 arterial (20 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>100), 42 arteriovenous (36.5 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>100) leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance was isolated in 12 cases (10.4 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>100) (heterozygous carriers): 7 venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 3 arteriovenous, 2 arterial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were measured at significant level in 49 cases (42.6 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>100): 21 venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 18 arteriovenous, 10 arterial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In this study, there was no statistical difference between the activated protein C resistance prevalence in leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> when compared with Lorraine population (p=0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden or anticardiolipin antibodies abnormalities were isolated in 56 cases (48.7 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>100) without statistical difference between the 3 types of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Finally, the pathophysiology of venous, arterial and arteriovenous leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> remains complex, suggesting several coagulation perturbations </plain></SENT>
