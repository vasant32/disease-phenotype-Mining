<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) antibodies and anti-human beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) antibodies is less striking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the problem of standardization for these tests is far from resolved, we evaluated whether the combination of results (antiphospholipid laboratory profiles) could help to better classify these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a 6-year period, 618 consecutive subjects (55% of whom had previous documented <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related events) were referred to our clinic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA was detected according to internationally accepted recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ACL and abeta2GPI antibodies were detected by Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' records were reviewed for the presence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> or obstetric complications according to Sapporo's clinical criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and each patient underwent a physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When individual tests were considered in a multivariate analysis which took into account age, gender, the presence of SLE or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and established risk factors for venous and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, LA (Odds Ratio 4.4, Confidence Interval 1.5-13.3) and abeta2GPI antibodies (Odds Ratio 2.9, Confidence Interval 1.1-7.5) but not aCL antibodies (Odds Ratio 1.2, Confidence Interval 0.5-2.7) were found to be independent risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> profiles instead of individual test positivity were analyzed in the above mentioned model, triple positivity resulted a strong independent risk factor (Odds Ratio 33.3, Confidence Interval 7.0-157.6), retaining its significance when the association with venous or arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double positivity with negative LA was close to significance for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-related events (Odds Ratio 2.2, Confidence Interval 1.0-5.2, p=0.056) and highly significant risk factor for obstetric complications (Odds Ratio 10.8, Confidence Interval 2.9-40.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other combinations did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean level of IgG abeta2GPI antibodies was statistically higher in triple positive profile and might account for positive LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As compared to a single test, the analysis of a complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> profile can better determine patients at risk </plain></SENT>
