<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less often they are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphataemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Analysis of 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> presenting consecutively with foot pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had metatarsal fractures (six bilateral) without any obvious history of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 13 of the 19 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the whole group, 13 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone mineral density, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>, and five others had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> as defined by WHO criteria; 10 had received steroids, mostly in low dosage; 13 were receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that a metabolic bone abnormality was a unifying factor in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atraumatic metatarsal stress fractures may occur in SLE, particularly in association with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of these fractures remains uncertain but microinfarcts in the metatarsal bones are a possible cause </plain></SENT>
