<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Different prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) have been reported in different populations of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chinese are generally believed to have lower risk of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the prevalence of aPL including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) antibodies, the level of thrombotic risk, and the association of aPL with thrombotic and pregnancy outcomes in a Chinese cohort with SLE at the university <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> clinic during the period 1986-2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aPL were measured in 272 SLE patients, and medical records were reviewed for vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of LAC, IgG aCL, and IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibodies was 22.4%, 29.0%, and 7.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 38 episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after a mean duration of followup of 11.0 +/- 6.8 SD years, giving a thrombotic rate of 1.26/100 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aPL were shown to be associated with vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> [8.0/100 patient-years or 25.0% (7/28)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients taking hydroxychloroquine were found to have fewer thrombotic complications than those who were not (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07-0.44; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC was the strongest factor associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> [relative risk 12.3, 95% CI 1.22-123.31; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was satisfied in 8.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lifetime and recurrent thrombotic rates in our patients with aPL were not particularly different from those in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the lower prevalence of aPL in our cohort may suggest a role of other prothrombotic factors in predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
