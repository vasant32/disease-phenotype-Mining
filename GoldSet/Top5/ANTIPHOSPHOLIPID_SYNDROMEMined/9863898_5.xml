<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and isotype distribution of aCL and its relationship with the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in childhood rheumatic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between November 1995 and May 1996, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who visited our paediatric rheumatology clinic whose guardians signed a consent form participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population included 106 patients (36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>), 11 fibromyalgia, 7 sarcoidosis, 5 dermatomyositis, 3 rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (RF), 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, and 11 miscellaneous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aCL measurements were performed by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were carefully evaluated for symptoms and signs of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 106 patients (17%) were tested positive for one or more of the three aCL isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SLE, aCL were found positive in 13 of 36 (37%); in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> 2 of 28 (7%); in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> 2 of 7; and in RF 1 of 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>aCL of IgG isotype were found positive in 16 patients (11 SLE, 2 sarcoidosis, 2 JRA, and 1 RF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This isotype was usually detected at low titers (16-24 GPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>aCL of IgM isotype were found positive in five patients (2 sarcoidosis, 2 SLE, 1 JRA), and aCL of IgA isotype were found positive in only three patients (2 SLE, 1 sarcoidosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of APS were rarely seen in our SLE population and were not associated with the presence of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in the other groups exhibited any clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aCL were found in 37% of our childhood SLE patients as compared with only 7% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These were mostly aCL of IgG isotype of low titers and therefore were not associated with the main features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies with a larger sample size may be needed to ascertain the exact prevalence and clinical significance of aCL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> SLE </plain></SENT>
