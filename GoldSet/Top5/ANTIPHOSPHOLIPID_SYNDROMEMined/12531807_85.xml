<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The thrombophilic state has been partially related to the induction of a proinflammatory and procoagulant endothelial cell (EC) phenotype induced by anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) antibodies that bind beta(2)-GPI expressed on the EC surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody binding has been shown to induce nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) translocation leading to a proinflammatory EC phenotype similar to that elicited by interaction with microbial products (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> [LPS]) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta [IL-1 beta], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the upstream signaling events are not characterized yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the endothelial signaling cascade activated by anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies, we transiently cotransfected immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) with dominant-negative constructs of different components of the pathway (Delta TRAF2, Delta TRAF6, Delta MyD88) together with reporter genes (NF-kappa B luciferase and pCMV-beta-galactosidase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that both human anti-beta(2)-GPI IgM monoclonal antibodies as well as polyclonal affinity-purified anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG display a signaling cascade comparable to that activated by LPS or IL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delta TRAF6 and Delta MyD88 significantly abrogate antibody-induced as well as IL-1- or LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation, whereas Delta TRAF2 (involved in NF-kappa B activation by TNF) does not affect it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti- beta(2)-GPI antibodies and LPS followed the same time kinetic of IL-1 receptor-activated kinase (IRAK) phosphorylation, suggesting an involvement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies react with their antigen likely associated to a member of the TLR/IL-1 receptor family on the EC surface and directly induce activation </plain></SENT>
