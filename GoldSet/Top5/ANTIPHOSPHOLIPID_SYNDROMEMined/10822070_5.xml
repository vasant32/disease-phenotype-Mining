<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of such acquired coagulation disturbances in adults are well described, only few data exist for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in a first step to collect new data we analyzed the presence of different <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> in 202 consecutive children and compared them with two groups of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The children screened for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were exclusively those who did not have any thromboembolic complications or a tendency for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> due to other underlying diseases such as systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in their past or present medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive blood samples were evaluated from routine laboratory specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups of adults comprised 200 patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and 200 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> that served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) screening tests were determined: the dilute Russell's viper venom test; a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time reagent; a second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time; and the Kaolin clotting time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> ELISA assays against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (ACA), beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-serine, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The children had a much higher prevalence for LA than did the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, their values for ACA were significantly lower than in adults with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings in children were similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This has to be taken into account when evaluating children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
