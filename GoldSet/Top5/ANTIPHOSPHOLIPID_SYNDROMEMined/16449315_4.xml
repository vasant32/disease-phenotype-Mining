<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Annexin A5 is thought to have a role in the pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS)-a syndrome characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether anti-annexin A5 immunoglobulin (Ig)M or IgG antibodies, or the -1C--&gt;T polymorphism of annexin A5, is a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, and whether the -1C--&gt;T polymorphism is correlated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort study was carried out with a population of 198 patients with primary APS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the detection of anti-annexin A5 antibodies and the measurement of annexin A5 plasma levels, ELISA-type methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annexin A5 -1C--&gt;T mutation was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 71 patients were positive for annexin A5 IgM or IgG antibodies, of whom 53 patients were positive for anti-annexin A5 IgG antibodies and 27 of 198 patients were positive for anti-annexin A5 IgM antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IgM or IgG anti-annexin A5 antibodies was not significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the -1C--&gt;T mutation in the annexin A5 gene (46/198 patients) was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 6.7, independent risk factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detection of anti-annexin A5 antibodies does not seem relevant for estimating the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The -1C--&gt;T mutation was an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, which is independent of APS </plain></SENT>
