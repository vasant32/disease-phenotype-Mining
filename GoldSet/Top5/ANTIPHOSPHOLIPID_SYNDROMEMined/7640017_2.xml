<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood cultures were negative, and prolonged treatment with intravenous antibiotics produced no echocardiographic improvement in the appearance of the vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was made subsequently, although test results for this condition had initially been <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial transesophageal echocardiograms showed complete resolution of the vegetations but some persistent thickening of the mitral leaflets, after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that in patients with culture-negative endocardial vegetations, specific tests should be performed for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and a therapeutic trial of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> should be undertaken before contemplating heart surgery </plain></SENT>
