<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to reveal the prevalence and correlation of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS) with clinical and laboratory manifestations of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine SLE patients and 41 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of patients (25.4%) had secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aCL and aPS antibody assays were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> isotypes of aCL and aPS antibodies except IgG were higher in patients with or without APS than those in the healthy controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant associations were found among <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and IgA aCL (p&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and both IgM aCL and IgM aPS (p&lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and IgM aCL (p&lt;0.01), pulmonary involvement and IgM aCL (p&lt;0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and IgA aPS (p&lt;0.01), and both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> with IgM aPS (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A relatively high prevalence of aCL and aPS antibodies was found in our SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems that isotypes of IgM aCL, IgM aPS, IgA aCL, and IgA aPS antibodies are correlated well with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and IgM aPS with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE patients with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The assessment of both IgM and IgA isotypes of aPS and aCL antibodies may be helpful in predicting these manifestations </plain></SENT>
