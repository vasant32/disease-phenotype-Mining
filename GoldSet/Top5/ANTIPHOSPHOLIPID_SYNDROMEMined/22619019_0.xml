<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At physical examination peripheral lymph nodes were not palpable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory studies revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> white blood cell count, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum C-reactive protein and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase were elevated on admission and rose further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasmatic coagulation was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> and reduced prothrombin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abdominal computed tomography showed an <z:mp ids='MP_0000691'>enlarged spleen</z:mp> with irregular hypodense areas, indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000702'>Enlarged lymph nodes</z:mp> were noted at the paraaortic region and in the splenic hilum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS: As the patient`s condition deteriorated from day to day a diagnosis had to be enforced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was thus performed which confirmed the CT findings of numerous infarcted areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A marginal zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found within the splenic hilar lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High titer serum antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> confirmed the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND COURSE: Oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumone</z:chebi> was started; in addition, chemotherapy with rituximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, vincristin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (R-CHOP) was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite clinical recovery serological markers of APS remained elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> recurred only six months after chemotherapy had been completed, and the patient died two months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of its potentially fatal consequences anticoagulation and treatment of the underlying disease are crucial in secondary APS </plain></SENT>
