<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and clinical associations of abnormalities on electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who have neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 57 patients (age &lt;/=50 years) with manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had APS, 24 patients were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), and 19 patients had SLE without aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent EEG and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while they were awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>Abnormal EEG</z:hpo> findings (showing mainly bitemporal slow activity) were recorded in 37 of 57 patients (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>Abnormal EEG</z:hpo> findings were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with APS and in 17 of 24 aPL-positive patients (71%), compared with 6 of 19 patients with SLE (32%) (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> findings and the frequency of aPL positivity (at least 2 positive results) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three EEG recordings showed potentially epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of brain MRI were abnormal in 18 (31.6%) of 57 patients: 8 in the APS group (57.1%), 7 in the aPL-positive group (29.2%), and 3 in the SLE group (15.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EEG findings had abnormal MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, brain MRI findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> results were more likely to report <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory problems</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> are common and correlate with the presence of aPL even in the absence of brain abnormalities on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>EEG should be considered in aPL-positive patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, because use of antiaggregants or anticoagulation may need to be considered </plain></SENT>
