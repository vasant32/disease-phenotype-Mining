<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigations included assays for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (ACA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (including antibodies against extractable nuclear antigen), anti-smooth muscle antibodies, anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, IgM-RF and complement factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference in the incidence of obstetric problems between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except that significantly more women were positive for ACA in the group with false-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> tests than in the control group, there were no differences between the groups with regard to the antibodies tested for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was only one case of SLE, a patient positive for LAC, and who had had several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and no pregnancy resulting in a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that it would be unwarranted to devote resources to routine screening for these antibodies in healthy women with a false-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> test result, though the presence of LAC could possibly be used as an indicator of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> due to SLE </plain></SENT>
