<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 64 sera from 32 patients (18 with primary or secondary APS, 14 with SLE without APS) and their respective IgG fractions or affinity purified anti-beta 2-GPI were studied by anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta 2-GPI enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and by chaotropic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six, 12, and 14 patients had high, low, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> avidity IgG anti-beta 2-GPI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients an increase in antibody avidity was observed over a period of between four and 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients with APS were in the high avidity than in the low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI group, while the opposite was observed for SLE alone (both p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical feature among patients with high avidity anti-beta 2-GPI was <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.02, respectively, v the low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS with or without SLE may have anti-beta2-GPI of high, low, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High avidity anti-beta 2-GPI appear to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and APS, while in pure SLE low avidity anti-beta 2-GPI may prevail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of avidity may help elucidate the role of anti-beta 2-GPI affinity maturation in the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
