<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some women with clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> test negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> ("antiphospholipid-like syndrome") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women with antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndromes have serum immunoglobulin G that harms murine pregnancy, suggesting that the mechanisms of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may be similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to determine whether patients with antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndromes share pathophysiology by comparing the histology of gestational tissues from these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Placenta and abortion specimens were obtained from 44 pregnancies in 26 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 37 pregnancies in 21 women with antiphospholipid-like syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 16 pregnancies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 8 with antiphospholipid-like syndrome were treated with a variety of medications intended to improve pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Placentas from 31 elective pregnancy terminations and 40 pregnancies complicated by idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> served as an additional control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty histologic parameters were systematically assessed by a single investigator who was blinded to the clinical status of the specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic findings were compared among groups using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> pregnancies included 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, 13 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and 16 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies in the antiphospholipid-like syndrome group resulted in 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, 30 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and one live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gestational tissues from antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndrome pregnancies were similar for every histologic feature tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Decidua from women with both antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndromes had more <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Placental tissue from antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndrome pregnancies showed more infarction, intravascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath>, syncytial knot formation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Histologic features were variable within groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no histologic differences in tissues from live births and pregnancy losses, or in treated and untreated pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Placental histopathology is similar in antiphospholipid and antiphospholipid-like syndrome pregnancies, suggesting that these disorders may share pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Histologic findings in women with APS are non-specific and may not differentiate between women with APS and APS-like syndromes </plain></SENT>
