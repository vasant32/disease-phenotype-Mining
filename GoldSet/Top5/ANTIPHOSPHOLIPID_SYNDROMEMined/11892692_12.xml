<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) have been frequently detected in juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e>), but have not been associated with disease activity or clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine aCL and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) antibody levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) in serial samples from children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> and to investigate the clinical significance of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The values of aCL, anti-beta2GPI and LA were prospectively followed in 28 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> from disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aCL and anti-beta2GPI were assayed by an ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal beta2GPI-dependent aCL (HCAL and EY2C9) were used as calibrators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA was determined by a modified dilute Russell viper venom time test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen (46.4%) children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> were already positive for aCL at their first referral to our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, the frequency of aCL decreased from 46.4% to 28.6%; however, it remained significantly higher compared with healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for anti-beta2GPI the difference in the frequency between the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> and healthy children was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial determination of aPL levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> patients revealed frequent fluctuations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive aCL persisted over time in 6 (21.4%) children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e>, 6 (21.4%) children were initially positive for aCL, but became later negative, and 3 (10.7%) children were initially negative for aCL and became later positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Persistently positive anti-beta2GPI were observed during the follow-up only in one patient, while none of the patients was persistently positive for LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No association between aCL, anti-beta2GPI or LA and disease activity could be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patient with positive aCL, anti-beta2GPI or LA showed any clinical feature of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The discrepancy between the presence of aCL and anti-beta2GPI might indicate that the production of aCL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> is associated with an infectious trigger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the low frequency of anti-beta2GPI and LA could explain the limited prothrombotic potential of aPL observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, we found a distinct group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> patients with persistently positive aCL, the clinical implications of which are at the present time unknown </plain></SENT>
