<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an English Canadian family in whom the propositus, a woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> and SLE, was found to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen members of 3 generations of this family underwent clinical assessments, serological testing and HLA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The propositus' mother had a family history of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> and the father had aCL, but was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> and the SLE were associated with HLA-B8, DR3 haplotype </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both these haplotypes were present in the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the other 4 carriers of the haplotype B60, DR4, 3 demonstrated significant titers of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the reported association between APS and the HLA haplotype DR4 in patients of English descent with SLE </plain></SENT>
