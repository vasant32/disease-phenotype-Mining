<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of aPL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) to determine if aPL were associated with the presence and severity of CAD, adverse outcomes, and other coronary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>/ACS were evaluated for aPL prior to diagnostic and therapeutic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiograms were graded according to the severity of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, including family histories, were assessed and patients were followed for adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, 232 patients (116 M, 116 F, mean age 63 years) with a mean follow-up of 9 months were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven percent (86/232) were positive for one or more aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More women, 49/86 (57%), were aPL positive versus men, 37/86 (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPL appeared associated with both presence and severity of CAD (P = 0.176 women; P = 0.163 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing procedures (angioplasty, stent, bypass), aPL was significantly associated with both an increase in adverse cardiac outcomes (P = 0.045) and extracardiac thrombotic events (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (abeta2GP1) was the most frequent aPL, occurring in 68.5% of aPL-positive patients with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) occurred in only 7.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IgM isotypes were the most frequent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> categories of aPL (range 55-90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS)-related events was more significant in aPL-positive than aPL-negative individuals (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
