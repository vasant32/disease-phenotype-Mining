<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical state of the children was evaluated immediately after delivery by a clinical examination, and a neonatological check-up was performed no later than 24 hours after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neonates with problems were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After their discharge from hospital the clinical state of the babies was followed by means of interviews with the pediatricians and mothers for a period varying between 1.33 and 5.66 years (mean 2.51 +/- 0.92 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The newborns comprised 30 females and 25 males, including 2 sets of twins, delivered between the 25th and 40th <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135241" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">weeks of gestation</z:e> (mean 36.69 +/- 2.91 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had a mean birth weight of 2.828 g +/- 706.50 SD (range 800-4.000) and a mean Apgar score at 5 minutes of 9.60 +/- 0.68 SD (range 7-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soon after delivery, 12 children (21.81%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for periods varying between 2 and 120 days (mean 30.33 +/- 33.40 SD), after which the clinical course was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these neonates suffered from complications exclusively due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malformations and signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or other aPL-related disorders were not observed in any of the newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, none of the diseases suffered by the 55 children differed from those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pediatric population; in particular, aPL-related manifestations were never observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate the absence of aPL-related problems in the offspring of aPL-positive mothers treated during pregnancy with calcium <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
