<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The confirmation of diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (APS) relies on laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current classification criteria for definite APS mandate the use of three "standardized" laboratory assays to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) [viz: anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and IgM, anti-β(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-β(2)GPI) antibodies IgG and IgM and/or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC)], when at least one of the two major clinical manifestations (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or pregnancy losses) are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several attempts have been made to standardize the aCL and anti-β(2)GPI tests, though, a considerable degree of inconsistencies still exist, limiting the clinical and diagnostic value of aPL tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the areas of concern are the type and source of calibrant material, the lack of proper validated reference material and of universal units of measurement, particularly for anti-β(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONTENT: A Task Force of scientists and leaders in the field from different countries - discussed and analyzed those critical questions in an evidence-based manner and further discussed and made recommendations at a workshop that was conducted during 13th International Congress on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA 2010, April 13-16, 2010, Galveston, TX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: This concise report summarizes the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the task force and preconference workshop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group recommended to ensure the availability of properly prepared and validated polyclonal and monoclonal antibody reference materials for both assays, to continue reporting the aCL assay in GPL/MPL units and to establish consensus international units of measurement for anti-β(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
