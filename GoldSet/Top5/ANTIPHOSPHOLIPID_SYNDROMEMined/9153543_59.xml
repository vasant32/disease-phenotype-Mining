<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor (TF), an inducible cell <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, is a major initiator of coagulation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate TF expression and procoagulant activity on monocytes from patients with primary APS and its correlation with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of patients were studied: group 1 comprised 23 primary APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, group 2 consisted of 10 primary APS patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and group 3 contained 20 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors were used as controls (group 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and LAC by standard methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell surface expression of TF on monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amount of TF in cell lysates (TF(Ag)) and soluble TF(Ag) plasma levels were analyzed by ELISA, and the TF-related procoagulant activity (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-TF) on intact cells and cell lysates by a chromogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of the cytokines that influence TF production, i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cell surface expression of TF was increased in group 1 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 50.2 +/- 4% positive cells) compared with group 2 (14.6 +/- 1.6%), group 3 (16.8 +/- 3.7%), and group 4 (14.1 +/- 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TF(Ag) levels were also elevated in group 1 (215.8 +/- 11.2 pg/10(6)) compared with group 2 (150.8 +/- 15.2), group 3 (101.4 +/- 14.8), and group 4 (80.32 +/- 5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-TF on intact cells and cell lysates was significantly increased in group 1 (148.8 +/- 16.3 units/10(5) lysate cells, compared with 54.5 +/- 11.5, 38.6 +/- 9.7, and 22.5 +/- 3.1 in groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among group 1 patients, there was a significant increase in the degree of TF expression in those positive for IgG aCL, but not in those positive for IgM aCL or LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TNF alpha and IL-1beta plasma levels did not differ significantly between any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that monocyte TF expression is directly involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic complications in patients with the primary APS </plain></SENT>
