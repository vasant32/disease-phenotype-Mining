<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts have been made to elucidate precise clinical features and adequate therapeutic options for treating patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of a proper international standard for measurement of aCL makes it difficult to compare data derived from different laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We attempted to design a chimeric antibody with human gamma constant regions and variable regions of WBCAL-1, a monoclonal antibody established from an APS-prone mouse which has a specificity similar to that of aCL in sera from humans with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variable-region genes of WBCAL-1, which were cloned using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were inserted into plasmids containing human gamma1 and kappa constant-region genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The construct was transfected to a mouse <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stable transfectants that secreted a chimeric antibody, HCAL, into the culture supernatant were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of HCAL to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) was studied using a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The binding of HCAL was compared with the binding of standards for IgG aCL and anti-beta2GPI antibody assays done in 18 independent laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the presence of beta2GPI, HCAL bound to the wells of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-coated microtiter plates in a dose-dependent manner and reacted with beta2GPI on oxygenated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aCL activity of HCAL can be converted into GPL units (IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units), which is widely used to quantify IgG aCL activity, using the following formula: 1 GPL unit = 32.9 x (concentration of HCAL [in microg/ml])(0.503) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of HCAL to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or beta2GPI was similar to the reactivity of standards for IgG aCL or anti-beta2GPI antibody assays done in collaborative laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because the reactivity of HCAL is similar to that of aCL in sera from humans with APS, HCAL will be useful as a standard for human IgG aCL and anti-beta2GPI antibody assays </plain></SENT>
