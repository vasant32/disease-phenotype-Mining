<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: 24 placentas from 18 patients with acquired and inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and 23 chorions from 19 miscarriages in women with the same diagnosis were included in the study There were 33 chorions from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> from healthy women and 25 placentas from uneventful pregnancies in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from placentas and chorions were stained with eosin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and evaluated for the presence of villous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fibrin deposits, intraplacental <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in fetal circulation and other histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the placentas from pregnancies complicated with APS and inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, the presence of fibrin deposits in the basal and villous plate, stasis in the fetal circulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the villous plate and villous vessels, were statistically more frequent (p &lt; 0,001) comparing with physiological pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the material from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> the presence of fibrin deposits was statistically more common (p &lt; 0,001) in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of physiological findings in placentas of women treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in pregnancy and in the non-treated ones, whose pregnancies resulted in fetal demise, were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrin deposits between villi and villous plate are the most recognizable features in placentas and chorions from APS pregnancies 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women with APS impaired trophoblast invasion seems to be the most likely cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy does not prevent either fibrin deposits collection or other placental changes </plain></SENT>
