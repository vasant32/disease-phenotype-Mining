<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that PAPS may be a predisposing factor to the development of this condition </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, untreated early pregnancy losses may be converted into treated pregnancies with late antenatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some patients with PAPS may therefore be prone to suffer either the previously reported complications of the uteroplacental vasculature, such as pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, and/or specific complications related to the environment of the intervillus space, such as MPVFD/MFI </plain></SENT>
