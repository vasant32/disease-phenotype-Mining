<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 67 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> (LE), 33 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> discoid type (CDLE), 22 with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> cutaneous type (SCLE) and 12 with systemic LE (SLE), the presence of circulating anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) of the IgG and IgM isotypes was investigated with an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACA of the IgG isotype were found in 13 patients (= 39.4%) with CDLE and ACA-IgM in 5 other cases (= 15.2%); among the SCLE patients ACA-IgG was increased in 8 (= 36.4%) and ACA-IgM in 1 other (= 4.5%), while in 3 further patients (= 13.6%) both ACA-IgG and IgM were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, ACA were found in 54.6% of the CDLE and in 54.5% of the SCLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SLE ACA-IgG alone was seen in 41.7% of the patients and ACA of both isotypes in another 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of ACA were higher in SLE than in the cutaneous LE subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation with the presence of ANA and binding capacity was detected in any of these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular symptoms were seen in 19 of 39 patients with detectable ACA (= 48.7%), whereas only 9 of 27 ACA-negative patients (= 33.3%) were found to have vascular symptoms on clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of the patients with isolated ACA-IgM elevation (5 CDLE patients, 1 SCLE patient) had vascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection of circulating ACA is a non-specific but rather sensitive marker for cutaneous LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, the ACA-IgG isotype shows a statistical correlation with the presence of vascular symptoms and is useful as a complement to the immune serological tests for the diagnosis of LE </plain></SENT>
