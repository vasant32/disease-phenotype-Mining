<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 678 patients with SLE enrolled in the Hopkins <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed to identify the occurrence of VT prior to cohort entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During cohort participation, VT was diagnosed by ultrasound or venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [LAC, Russell viper venom time (RVVT) assay] and anticardiolipin (aCL, polyclonal assay) status of each subject was determined on a quarterly basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate probability of having a VT over time since SLE diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between the most recently measured values of LAC and aCL on the subsequent risk of VT was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Counting only first occurrences, the rate of VT was 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those with a mean RVVT greater than 37 s during followup, an estimated 42% will develop a VT within 20 years of SLE diagnosis [95% confidence interval (CI) 21% to 63%, p &lt; 0.0001 compared to those with lower RVVT] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The immediate risk (hazard) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> increased 34% with each 5 second prolongation of the RVVT test, based on the most recent assessment of RVVT, controlling for gender and cholesterol [p = 0.0022, 95% CI 11% to 61%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of those with a mean polyclonal aCL greater than 2.3 units, 34% developed a VT within 20 years of SLE diagnosis (95% CI 11% to 57%, p = 0.0097 compared to those with lower aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The immediate risk (hazard) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was not significantly associated with the most recent assessment of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This large prospective study indicates that patients with SLE are at substantial risk for VT over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both the presence of a LAC and of polyclonal aCL are associated with the risk of VT, but LAC is a better predictor of risk than is aCL </plain></SENT>
