<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report for the first time on the effects of exercise training in juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (JSLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 15-yr-old boy with JSLE and APS treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> underwent a 12-wk aerobic exercise training program to improve his physical capacity and functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after the 12-wk exercise program, the patient was submitted to incremental cardiopulmonary tests to determine VO(2peak), peak and submaximal exercise intensity, and time to exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a 6-min square-wave test was performed for assessing metabolic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functioning was assessed by using the visual analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were also assessed at baseline and 48 h after the last training session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cardiopulmonary parameters (e.g., VO(2max) = +36.0%, time to exhaustion = +67.8%, peak exercise intensity = +16.7%) and the metabolic cost of movement (e.g., energy expenditure = -28.3% to -33.3%, VO(2) = -29.3% to -33.4%) were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both disease activity and cumulative damage scores did not change after the intervention, and no evidence of exercise-induced exacerbation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Visual analog scale scores were also improved according to the patients' evaluation (before intervention = 8 vs after intervention = 10), parents' evaluation (before intervention = 8 vs after intervention = 10), and physicians' evaluation (before intervention = 6 vs after intervention = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that a 12-wk supervised aerobic training program can be safe and effective in improving aerobic conditioning and physical function in a patient with JSLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In light of these findings, the therapeutic effects of exercise training in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> merit further investigations </plain></SENT>
