<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACA were correlated with clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and other serological markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty three percent of sera had ACA IgG (+) and 50% ACA IgM (+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients, five of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, had a history of arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had positive ACA (IgG (+) in 7 and IgM (+) in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, no association was found between the presence of ACA and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> had non significantly higher levels of ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between ACA levels and rheumatoid factor (ACA IgG r = 0.374, ACA IgM r = 0.676), no other association was found between ACA and other autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that ACA are found frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and its clinical significance may be different in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
