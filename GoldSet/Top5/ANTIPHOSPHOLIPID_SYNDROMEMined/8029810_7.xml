<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the two ACAs derived from these cell lines revealed that one (Ab-019, subclass IgM, kappa) reacted exclusively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and showed strong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, while the other (Ab-226, subclass IgM, lambda) reacted with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> such as phosphatidylserine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17517">phosphatidylglycerol</z:chebi>, as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that ACA is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> even in the same individual, and that reactivity against negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> corresponds to reactivity against endothelial cell </plain></SENT>
