<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The trial included 33 patients (2 males and 31 females) aged 20-62 years (mean age 32.7 +/- 9.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>29 patients suffered from SLE, 17 of them had also APS (criteria by G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>V Hudhes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 patients had primary APS, 1 female had hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM-aCL were detected by enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In revealing mutation, DNA was used isolated from peripheral blood by standard methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary screening of Leiden mutation was made according to Bertina et al. with Mnl I restrictase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation was confirmed by an original technique with allele-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was determined with restrictase Taq I after introduction of artificial restriction site in PCR product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Group 1 incorporated 12 patients with SLE without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Group 2--21 patients with APS (17 with SLE + APS, 3 with primary APS and 1 with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients of group 1 had neither thrombotic complications nor Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients of group 2 had heterozygous Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both females were aPL-positive and had previously <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One of them had also recurrent disorders of cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>None of the examinees had any G20210A mutations in the prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detection of genetic defects in APS provide arguments in the dispute about the necessity, duration and choice of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>If patients with APL syndrome appeared to have besides aPL also genetic defects in coagulation, this will enable identification of patients at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> which need permanent administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> among which only low-molecular ones or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycanes</z:chebi> are indicated </plain></SENT>
