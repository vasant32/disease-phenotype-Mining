<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that alterations in tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and annexin V expressions contribute to poor pregnancy outcome associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Frozen sections from random biopsy samples of the basal plates of placentas from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n = 9), patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n = 3), and gestational age-matched control subjects (n = 10) were immunostained for tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and annexin V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intensity of immunostaining was assessed by means of quantitative image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annexin V protein expression was evaluated with Western blotting techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tissue factor was expressed in the perivascular cells of the villous vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombomodulin and annexin V immunostaining was localized to the syncytiotrophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the intensity of immunostaining for tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and annexin V between placentas from women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and those from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of annexin V expression showed no differences between study patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Alterations in placental coagulant pathways involving tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and annexin V do not contribute to poor pregnancy outcome associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
