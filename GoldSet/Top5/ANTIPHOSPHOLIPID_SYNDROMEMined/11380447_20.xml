<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Addition of affinity-purified anti-prothrombin antibodies from LAC-positive plasma samples (alpha-FII-LAC+) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma induced LAC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon increasing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentration, LAC activity was neutralized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of purified alpha-FII-LAC+ to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma strongly inhibited factor Xa formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No inhibition was measured when alpha-FII-LAC+ were added to prothrombin-deficient plasma or when purified anti-prothrombin antibodies from LAC-negative plasma samples (alpha-FII-LAC-) were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a combination of prothrombin and alpha-FII-LAC+ was added to the purified clotting complex, a strong inhibition of factor Xa and IIa formation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The alpha-FII-LAC+ alone or a combination of prothrombin and alpha-FII-LAC- did not show inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ellipsometry studies showed that, in the presence of alpha-FII-LAC+, the affinity of prothrombin for a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface increased dramatically, whereas a much lower increase was observed with alpha-FII-LAC- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that complexes of prothrombin and anti-prothrombin antibodies with LAC activity inhibit both prothrombinase and tenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antibodies increase the affinity of prothrombin for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface, thereby competing with clotting factors for the available catalytic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface, a mechanism similar to that of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies </plain></SENT>
