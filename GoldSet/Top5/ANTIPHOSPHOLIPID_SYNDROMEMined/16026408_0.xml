<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient group comprised 6 Japanese women diagnosed for DVT or PE at Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, between July 1997 and April 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 30 healthy Japanese women in early puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APC-sensitivity ratio (APC-sr), complete blood count (CBC), and other coagulant variables (thrombin-antithrombin-complex (TAT) and fibrin/fibrinogen-degration product (FDP)-D-dimer levels) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean APC-sr was 2.0 +/- 0.3 in the control group and significantly higher (3.3 +/- 1.0) in the patient group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FDP-D-dimer level was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, but there was no significant difference in the TAT complex level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sensitivity to APC is reduced in patients with DVT or PE during early puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although further clinical studies are needed to confirm, it appears that sensitivity to APC detected by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>-based assay could become a useful marker to estimate the occurrence of DVT or PE </plain></SENT>
