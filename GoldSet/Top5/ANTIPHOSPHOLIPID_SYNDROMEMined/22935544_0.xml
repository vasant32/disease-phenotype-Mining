<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six PAPS patients and 72 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, ESR, CRP, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of MetS was determined as defined by the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was rated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentrations of leptin were higher [21.5 (12.9-45.7) ng/mL] in PAPS patients than in the controls [12.1 (6.9-26.8) ng/mL), p=0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In PAPS patients, leptin and PAI-1 levels were positively correlated with BMI (r=0.61 and 0.29), HOMA-IR (r=0.71 and 0.28) and CRP (r=0.32 and 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with BMI (r=-0.28), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r=-0.43) and HOMA-IR (r=-0.36) and positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c (r=0.37) and anti-β2GPI IgG (r=0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of MetS in PAPS patients was associated with higher levels of leptin (p=0.002) and PAI-1 (p=0.03) levels and lower levels of adiponectin (p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variables that independently influenced the adiponectin concentration were the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels (p&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-c (P=0.002) and anti-β2GPI IgG (p=0.042); the leptin levels were BMI (p&lt;0.001), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p=0.046), HOMA-IR (p&lt;0.001) and ESR (p=0.006); and the PAI-1 levels were CRP (p=0.013) and MetS (p=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that adipocytokines may be involved in low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and MetS in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
