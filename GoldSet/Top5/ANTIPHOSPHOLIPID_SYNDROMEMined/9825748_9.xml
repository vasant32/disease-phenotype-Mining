<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2GPI) and anti-prothrombin (anti-ProT) antibody levels, and the IgG subclass distribution of anti-beta2GPI antibodies, in serial samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) having initial or recurrent thrombotic/neurological (T/N) events during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the correlations between these antibodies and beta2GPI antigen, anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA, C3 levels and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty serum samples were identified from seven patients with SLE who had had T/N events during the follow-up from a cohort under long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI, anti-ProT, aCL, IgG subclasses of anti-beta2GPI and beta2GPI antigen levels were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding disease activity [British Isles <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Assessment Group (BILAG)], anti-dsDNA and C3 levels were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG anti-beta2GPI antibody levels were elevated in six of the patients before and after the T/N events with less marked fluctuations than aCL antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant subclass of anti-beta2GPI antibodies was IgG2 before and after the T/N events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-ProT antibodies were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant but weak correlation between anti-beta2GPI and aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between disease activity and IgG anti-beta2GPI antibody and beta2GPI antigen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were fluctuations in beta2GPI antigen levels and a trend to increase after T/N events was observed in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with a T/N event during the study period had IgG anti-beta2GPI, but not IgG anti-ProT antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many IgG aCL-negative samples were found to have IgG anti-beta2GPI activity during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predominant subclass of IgG anti-beta2GPI was IgG2, which may have importance in the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI antigen levels were found to be increased in some patients with SLE after T/N events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies may be used as an adjunctive marker of future T/N events in patients with SLE and APS with aCL antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
