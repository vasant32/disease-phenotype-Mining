<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) shares approximately 20% sequence identity with the major histocompatibility complex class 1/CD1 family of molecules, accelerates the thrombin-thrombomodulin-dependent generation of activated protein C, a natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, binds to activated neutrophils, and can undergo translocation from the plasma membrane to the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blocking protein C/activated protein C binding to the receptor inhibits not only protein C activation but the ability of the host to respond appropriately to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> challenge, exacerbating both the coagulant and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand how EPCR accomplishes these multiple tasks, we solved the crystal structure of EPCR alone and in complex with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding domain of protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structures were strikingly similar to CD1d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A tightly bound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> resides in the groove typically involved in antigen presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein C binding site is outside this conserved groove and is distal from the membrane-spanning domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extraction of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> resulted in loss of protein C binding, which could be restored by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD1d augments the immune response by presenting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EPCR structure is a model for how CD1d binds <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and further suggests additional potential functions for EPCR in immune regulation, possibly including the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
