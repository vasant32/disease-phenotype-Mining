<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLAs) has been extensively studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) but not in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024137" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cutaneous lupus erythematosus</z:e> (CLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the prevalence of APLAs among our patients with CLE, and analyzed their clinical and serologic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 182 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CLE who had been in follow-up for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected those positive for 1 or more of the following APLAs in 2 measurements at least 12 weeks apart: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs), and anti-β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-β2-GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of ACAs and anti-β2-GPI antibodies, only patients with titers greater than or equal to 40 U/mL were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We obtained a series of 13 patients (4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> disease and 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven met the diagnostic criteria for SLE and only 1 met the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of APLAs was 38% among patients with SLE and 3.65% among those without SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent APLA was LA, present in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANAs) were detected in 12 patients and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> antibodies in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of APLAs among our patients with CLE who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for SLE was similar to that reported in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This, along with the strong assocation between the presence of ANAs and the presence of APLAs, would bring into question the value of determining APLAs in patients with CLE who are negative for ANAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also note that there was a high prevalence of discoid lesions but a low prevalence of APS among our patients with CLE who were positive for APLAs </plain></SENT>
