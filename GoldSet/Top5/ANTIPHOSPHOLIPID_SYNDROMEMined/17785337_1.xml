<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) positive for abeta(2)GPI IgG antibodies and three calibrators (a pool of abeta(2)GPI-positive patients, the monoclonal HCAL antibody, and a home-made calibrator) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No differences with regard to the blocking step were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences were found between the neutral and basic coating buffer when HCAL was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between Maxisorp and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other brands of tested microplates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were found between phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other dilution buffers examined, with exception of TRIS when HCAL or the home-made calibrator was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were differences between our routine conjugate and one of the other four conjugates tested when using two of the three calibrators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also significant differences between the routine and another conjugate analyzed when using the third calibrator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As variations in abeta(2)GPI ELISA conditions determine significant differences in the results, selecting the appropriate test variables is an important step toward abeta(2)GPI assay standardization </plain></SENT>
