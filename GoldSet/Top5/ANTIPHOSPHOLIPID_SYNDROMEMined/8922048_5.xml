<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>M-mode, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was performed in 101 consecutive patients (46 with SLE, 23 with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>, 12 with RA, 20 with PAPS) and in 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients and of the controls had clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Valvular lesions were found in 18 SLE patients (39.1%), in 4 PSS patients (17.4%) and in 3 RA patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the control subjects abnormal indexes of left ventricular filling (characterized by a reduced E/A end E/A-VTI ratios, a lower deceleration rate of EF slope and a prolonged IVRT) was only found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> (15.1% in SLE patients, 30% in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> patients and 40% in RA patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of aCL was not related to a different prevalence of valve alterations or alterated left ventricular diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with PAPS showed valvular involvement or altered left ventricular filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that cardiac involvement is frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> but is apparently unrelated to increased aCL levels </plain></SENT>
