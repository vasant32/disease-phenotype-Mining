<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define at the molecular level the vascular endothelial cell (VEC) injury characteristics of catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) and to report successful therapeutic use of a VEC modulator, defibrotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a 55-year-old man with primary APS with an intractable prothrombotic state (CAPS) resistant to combined therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, aspirin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with defibrotide was conducted in the context of an investigational phase II protocol where the dose was regulated and individualized by disease/patient-specific molecular and clinical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient entered complete remission with defibrotide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During treatment, dose dependent pharmacological actions of defibrotide and key stress markers for VEC injury were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence of defibrotide's polypharmacology included downregulation of cytokines, notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, as the earliest effect, cellular differentiation of VEC, possibly with direct regulatory effect over cellular genes, and the reversal of platelet consumption and prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Von Willebrand</z:e> antigen levels were used as the sole marker to guide therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates effective remission of CAPS with defibrotide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to theories that CAPS is triggered by ischemic and thrombotic tissue damage, these data present VEC injury as the primary and representative lesion of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis may involve concurrent impairment of different VEC functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Achieving remission may require a polypharmacologic approach, represented here by use of defibrotide </plain></SENT>
