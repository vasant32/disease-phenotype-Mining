<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that anti-drug antibodies could be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, another mechanism fits more with the available immunochemical data and could lead to practical measures to prevent TE events during anti-TNF therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects are not related to the type of <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, but well to the combination of the inhibition of TNF and the predisposition of some patients to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like reactions, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overproduction of interferon-α, caused by the inhibition of TNF in these individuals would foster the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, seeking conventional markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (e.g. anti-dsDNA, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, anti-β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antibodies) before the administration of an anti-TNF could be a prudent measure </plain></SENT>
