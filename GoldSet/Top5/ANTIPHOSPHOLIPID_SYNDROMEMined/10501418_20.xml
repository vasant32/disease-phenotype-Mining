<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, position 247 polymorphism may affect the conformational change of beta2GPI and the exposure of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (= anti-beta2GPI antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we analysed the genetic polymorphism of beta2GPI in a British cohort of well-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised 88 Caucasoid patients with APS [57 with primary APS and 31 with APS secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism assignment was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-beta2GPI antibodies was detected by ELISA utilizing irradiated ELISA plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-beta2GPI antibodies were present in 28 of 57 primary APS patients (49%) and in 19 of 31 secondary APS patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele containing valine247 was significantly more frequent in primary APS patients with anti-beta2GPI antibodies than in controls (OR = 2.51, 95%, CI 1.03-6.13, P = 0.0396) or in primary APS patients without anti-beta2GPI antibodies (OR = 2.92, 95% CI 1.16-7.39, P = 0.0204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This tendency was not found in the secondary APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the beta2GPI polymorphism, valine/leucine247, is correlated with anti-beta2GPI antibody production in patients with primary APS, and valine247 may be important in the formation of beta2GPI antigenicity </plain></SENT>
