<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We considered patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> due to a lesion in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (shown by CT or MRI) as a model of this infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed history including maternal and familiar data was obtained from 9 affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplex-sonography was performed and biochemical parameters were analysed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and their mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no convincing hints for a prenatal (for instance infectious, traumatic or toxic) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also the reconstruction of the perinatal period could not explain the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex-sonography revealed no anatomic variants of the intra- or extracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haemostasiological results were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits--except the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, which were detected in 7 of the 9 families (patient or mother) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of these results is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and further haemostasiological parameters should be investigated as near as possible to the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
