<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore the therapeutic effect and the mechanism of Chinese herbs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) by observing the effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge injectio (SmBI) on anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) induced by beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GP I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty female mice randomly fell into 6 groups: group A, B, C, D was injected through abdominal cavity with different dosage of SmBI daily; after 14 d, group A, B, C, E was immunized with 150 microg of purified human beta2-GP I in complete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously; group F as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The titre of aCL were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; subsets of T cell were grouped by streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> complex technique; and the activity of IL-2 was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> chromatometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Compared with group E, the absorbance (A) of aCL in group A, B, and C was decreased (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By linear correlation, the dosage is negatively correlated with the A values of aCL in 1, 2, and 3 weeks (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Compared with group E, TH/TS ratio was reduced in group A, B, and C (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01); there is no significant differences between group D and F (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By linear correlation, the dosage is negatively correlated with TH/TS ratio (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Compared with E, the activity of IL-2 in group B and C decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By linear correlation, there is negative correlation between dosage and IL-2 activity (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference between D and F (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(4) There is positive correlation between TH/TS ratio and IL-2 activity in different dilutions (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mechanism of suppressive effect of SmBI on aCL induced by beta2-GP I may be realized by resuming the elevated TH/TS ratio and IL-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The state that SmBI have no effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice indicates that SmBI has selective immunoregulative functive </plain></SENT>
