<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported the induction of APS associated with behavioral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in BALB/c female mice that developed 4-5 months after immunization with beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the influence of genetic factors on the ability to induce experimental APS with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement by testing several mouse strains immunized with beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Female mice from five strains were immunized once with beta(2)-GPI in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or with CFA alone (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody levels were examined at 1 and 5 months after immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment in a staircase test was performed 4-5 months following the immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induction of APS resulted in elevated levels of antibodies against negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and beta(2)-GPI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody levels were significantly higher in Balb/c, ICR, and C57BL/6 mouse strains compared to AKR and C3H. aPL levels dropped significantly more in the C57BL/6 compared to Balb/c mice over a period of 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>Hyperactivity</z:hpo> reflected by higher number of stairs climbed in 3 min, was induced by APS in the Balb/c and ICR, mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exploratory behavior reflected by more frequent rears, was seen in the APS-Balb/c and AKR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>Hypoactivity</z:mp> and less exploration were seen in the APS-C57BL/6 and C3H mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study supports a link between high levels of aPL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> in a mouse APS model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Qualitative differences in behavioral patterns may be due to <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system as well as immune genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The minimal effect of APS in C57BL/6 mice may provide a suitable background for the study of transgenes in these mice </plain></SENT>
