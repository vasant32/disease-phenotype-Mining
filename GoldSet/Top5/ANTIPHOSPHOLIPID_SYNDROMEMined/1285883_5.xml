<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar experimental APLS is induced by active immunization with serum as well as with natural human monoclonal ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APLS is also associated with low fecundity rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental APLS models were employed to demonstrate the efficacy of aspirin, low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and interleukin-3 preventing recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another experiment, immunization with human monoclonal anti-DNA antibody was followed by the induction of APLS secondary to experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, IgGs were found to be more pathogenic than IgMs ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies confirm the autoimmune nature of APLS </plain></SENT>
