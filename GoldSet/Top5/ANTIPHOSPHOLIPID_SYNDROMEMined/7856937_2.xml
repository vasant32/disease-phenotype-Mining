<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are detected by Elisa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite its simplicity, the results obtained by this assay are not always reproducible despite several worldwide standardizations and the distribution of calibration sera by EN Harris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On 4 December 1992, the First French Anticardiolipin Antibodies Standardization Workshop was held in Paris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight coded standards were sent to 33 laboratories in France, one in Switzerland and one in Luxembourg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of them used several assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement between qualitative results was good for samples with high and moderate level of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But the results expressed in IgG antiphospholipid units were scattered, the interlaboratory coefficient of variation for each of the eight standards was higher than 70%, though the within-run coefficient of variation had a median value of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assays using bovine serum for the blocking buffer and for the dilution buffer seemed to give more reproducible results than assays using purified bovine serum albumin (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For only nine assays out of 38 which expressed results quantitatively, was a linear regression observed between the dilutions of a sample and the results expressed in IgG antiphospholipid units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Absence of linearity is an obstacle which must be overcome if we wish to compare quantitative results obtained by different laboratories </plain></SENT>
