<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in APS has been poorly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined for the first time, to our knowledge, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in patients with APS and its association with clinical, laboratory, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients (39 with primary APS and 21 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-related APS) and 60 healthy individuals matched for age, sex, and education were examined by means of a comprehensive 3-hour battery of neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had a history of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine of 60 patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at the time of neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A disease control group not fulfilling criteria for APS (15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>) was also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of patients were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five (42%) of the 60 patients with APS had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> compared with 11 (18%) healthy control subjects (P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most commonly involved cognitive domains were complex attention and verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in cognitive performance between patients with primary APS and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-related APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No relationship was detected between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and prior central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We noted a significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (P = .004) as well as between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and the presence of white matter lesions on the findings of brain magnetic resonance imaging (P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected in cognitive performance between the disease control group and healthy individuals (P=.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive deficits</z:hpo> may often be found among patients with APS, independent of any history of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and the presence of white matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging are associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in APS </plain></SENT>
