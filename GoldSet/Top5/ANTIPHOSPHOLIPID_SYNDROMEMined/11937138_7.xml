<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on trophoblast expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Primary cytotrophoblast cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women underwent uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): IgG antibodies were isolated from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subject, using protein-G <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotrophoblast cells were dispersed in bicarbonate buffer containing trypsin and DNAse I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We investigated the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on trophoblast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (alpha1 and alpha5 integrins, E and VE cadherins), both at the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): The alpha1 and alpha5 integrins were present in trophoblast cells from 24 hours of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IgG that were obtained from the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> significantly decreased alpha1 integrin and increased alpha5 integrin at both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IgG with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> activities induced VE-cadherin down-regulation and the E-cadherin up-regulation at protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels compared with control IgG or untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): The results suggest that the inadequate trophoblastic invasion, induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, can be the result of abnormal trophoblast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules expression </plain></SENT>
