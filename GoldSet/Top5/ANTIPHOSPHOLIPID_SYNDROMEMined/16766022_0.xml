<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) have been recently related to the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> antibodies (aPE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is well known that some molecules such as cryoglobulins, immunoglobulins that undergo a reversible precipitation at low temperatures, may interfere with biological assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this in view, we report the case of a patient with APS who was positive for both IgM aPE and type III <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we show for this patient a potential implication of aPE in the cryoprecipitate formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further analyze the potential association between cryoglobulins and aPE, and also the possible consequences for aPE assay, we selected 55 patients according to positivity for both IgM aPE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determination of IgM aPE levels was made before and after removal of cryoprecipitate from the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 55 selected patients, 52 (95%) presented no significant difference for IgM aPE levels before and after cryoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were ascertained whatever the aPE levels and clinical status of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results indicate that cryoprecipitation does not interfere in most cases (95%) with the dosage of IgM aPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, IgM aPE do not appear to be involved in the formation of the cryoprecipitate </plain></SENT>
