<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 352 women with average age of 31.4 (+/- 4.3) who experienced one or more pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients from 5 University centers: Poznań, Białystok, Lublin, Wrocław and Bydgoszcz were divided into 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 1st group there were 150 women with recurrent early pregnancy losses before 10 weeks gestation, in the 2nd group we included 160 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses, in the 3rd group we analyzed 42 women with labor complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental insufficiency</z:mp> within or before 34 gestational week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 352 women were screened for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti beta2glikoprotein I (abeta2GPI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first two antibodies were investigated with ELISA test and the last one with APPT based test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the second positive result qualified patients as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and beta2glicoprotein I were analyzed in three classes--IgA, IgG and IgM--where the laboratory criteria of positivity were titers above 40 unitsU/ml or above 99 centile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 13 patients (3.69%) in the screened population of 352 women met the criteria of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of APS in women with early and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses were 1.33% and 6.25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common antibody found was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 3 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three antibodies were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature deliveries</z:hpo> complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental insufficiency</z:mp> the frequency of APS was 2.58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> should be routinely performed in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that APS is rarely found in women with pregnancy loss before 10 gestational week </plain></SENT>
