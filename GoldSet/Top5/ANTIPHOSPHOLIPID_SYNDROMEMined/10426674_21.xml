<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University based tertiary referral clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: One hundred and fifty pregnant women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> associated with persistently positive tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was detected using the dilute Russell's viper venom time together with a platelet neutralisation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were detected using a standardised enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An IgG anticardiolipin level &gt; or = 5 per litre units and an IgM anticardiolipin level &gt; or = 3 per litre units was considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin (75 mg daily) was commenced at the time of a positive pregnancy test and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (5000 units subcutaneously 12 hourly, or enoxaparin 20 mg daily) was started when fetal heart activity was demonstrated on ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stopped at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> or at 34 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seven pregnancies (71%) resulted in a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-one pregnancies (27%) miscarried, the majority in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One woman had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, and one a premature baby who died in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy was terminated for a fetal anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> complicated 17% (18/108) of ongoing pregnancies and antepartum haemorrhage 7% (8/108) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six babies (24%) were delivered before 37 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fifty women (46%) were delivered by caesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median birthweight of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> live born infants was 3069 g (range 531-4300); however 15% (16/108) of the infants were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> leads to a high live birth rate among women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, successful pregnancies are prone to a high risk of complications during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trimesters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Close antenatal surveillance and planned delivery of these pregnancies in a unit with specialist obstetric and neonatal intensive care facilities are indicated </plain></SENT>
