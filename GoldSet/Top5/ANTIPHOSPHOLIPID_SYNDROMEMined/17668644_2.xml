<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> (n = 9) was a major nondiagnostic symptom; major diagnostic manifestations were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (n = 10) and serositis (n = 7) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>High frequency of misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis were probably responsible for these </plain></SENT>
