<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is of considerable interest to ascertain whether a hollow fiber cartridge containing histidine immobilized on polyethylenevinyl alcohol membrane (His-PEVA) is able to retain specific autoantibodies involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end diluted patient pathogenic plasma containing high levels of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) and antiprothrombin antibodies was processed through the functionalized cartridge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adsorbed material was then eluted under mild conditions and analyzed; an enrichment of the eluted fractions in total IgG and more specifically in IgG2 subclass was observed, compared with the injected sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests showed a higher specific binding of antiprothrombin and anti-beta2GPI in these fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was in accordance with the concomitant higher <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity measured on the same fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in vitro results clearly demonstrated the ability of the His-PEVA cartridge to preferentially adsorb these autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence the functionalized cartridge represents a potential tool for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> by selective extracorporeal removal of IgG </plain></SENT>
