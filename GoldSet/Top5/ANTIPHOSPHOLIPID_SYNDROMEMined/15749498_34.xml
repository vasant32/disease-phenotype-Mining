<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) in combination with low-dose aspirin (LDA) for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>)-associated recurrent pregnancy loss and to compare the results with the use of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) plus LDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, multicenter pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two academically based reproductive health centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Patients with three or more pregnancy losses and positive <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Patients were treated with LMWH and LDA (n = 25) or UFH and LDA (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fetal outcome and maternal complications from treatments were compared between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Of the 25 patients in the LMWH group, 21 (84%) delivered a viable infant and 4 (16%) miscarried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 25 patients in the UFH group, 20 (80%) delivered a viable infant and 5 (20%) miscarried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes occurred during pregnancy or at the time of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, or bone fractures were noted in either of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): In this pilot study, the use of LDA in combination with LMWH during pregnancy for the prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> seems to be as safe as UFH plus LDA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Large, randomized trials will be required to determine differences in outcome with LMWH and LDA compared with treatment with UFH combined with LDA in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
