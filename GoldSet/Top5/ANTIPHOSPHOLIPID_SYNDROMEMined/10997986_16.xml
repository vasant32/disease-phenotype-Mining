<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between these antibodies and FXII levels appeared to be variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to confirm the presence of antibodies to FXII in patients with well characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to establish their potential effect on levels of FXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with APS were studied; 21 patients were found to have either immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM antibodies to FXII by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a highly purified preparation of FXII (&gt; 99% pure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of FXII were statistically significantly lower (P = 0.02) in patients with antibodies to FXII when compared with patients without antibodies to FXII (median = 91 micro/dl, s.d. = 39.1, median = 122 micro/dl, s.d. = 41.1 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 21 patients with antibodies to FXII were found to have FXII levels below the laboratory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to FXII are present in significant numbers of patients with APS and may lead to acquired FXII deficiency </plain></SENT>
