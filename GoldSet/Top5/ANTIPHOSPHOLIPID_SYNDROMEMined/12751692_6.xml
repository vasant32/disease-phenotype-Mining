<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2-GPI) are suggested as a new marker for the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of abeta2-GPI in the official diagnostic criteria has so far been precluded owing to lack of an international standard and also technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples from 5367 consecutive patients sent to a national reference laboratory mainly because of various thrombotic events were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An IgG abeta2-GPI ELISA assay was performed in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (dRVVT and PTT-LA) and IgG anticardiolipin antibody determinations to evaluate patient groups in which the new assay might be of value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From a total of 90 patients, 2.2% of the samples were abeta2-GPI positive; 51 patients had abeta2-GPI as the only positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> marker; 20 patients had had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and 14 an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, 4 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relatively young patients with cerebrovascular ischaemic events seemed especially to present sole abeta2-GPI positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abeta2-GPI positivity remained fairly constant in the 23 patients from whom follow-up samples were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the IgG abeta2-GPI assay seems to be a potentially important additional diagnostic tool for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
