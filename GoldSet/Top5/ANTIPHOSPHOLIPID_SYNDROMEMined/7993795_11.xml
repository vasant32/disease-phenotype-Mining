<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects upon prothrombin activation supported by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles of plasma IgG preparations from APS patients in the presence and absence of beta 2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a purified system for measurement of prothrombin activation to thrombin, we demonstrated significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentration-dependent inhibition of prothrombin activation in the absence of beta 2GP1 by 11 consecutive patient IgG preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of inhibition of prothrombin activation by equivalent concentrations of patient IgG correlated well with the extent of prolongation of the plasma clotting time in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> assays of whole patient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional studies with eight patient IgG preparations indicated that the addition of beta 2GP1 to patient IgG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicle mixtures resulted in either independently additive inhibition by the two protein species (six cases) or potential inhibition of beta 2GP1 of the IgG inhibitory activity demonstrable in the absence of beta 2 GP1 (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, beta 2GP1-independent inhibition of prothrombin activation also occurred with three patient IgG preparations obtained by affinity binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
