<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery spasms</z:e> or embolism can be attributed to such events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case report, we present a 30-year-old male who had his first MI at the age of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He received percutaneous intervention as initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive risk factor management, he continued to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary events and was later diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, he was diagnosed with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He underwent pulmonary endartererectomy, tricuspid annuloplasty and radial artery bypass graft to the first obtuse marginal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> therapy was initiated upon the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite being therapeutic on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aggressive risk factor management, he had yet another MI </plain></SENT>
