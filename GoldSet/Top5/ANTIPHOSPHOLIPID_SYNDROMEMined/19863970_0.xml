<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old (case 1) and a 22-year-old woman (case 2) who developed severe neurological deficits (NIHSS 20 and 13, respectively) were presented to our hospital 9h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case 1 a CT angiography (CTA) revealed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and in case 2 CTA showed a large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> at the left carotid bifurcation, almost entirely occluding the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We decided to apply IAT beyond the generally accepted 6-hour time window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1 was treated with 2mg rtPA administered locally in the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> followed by 70 mg rtPA (1 mg/min) and case 2 was treated with 100,000 IU urokinase in the left common carotid artery followed by 200,000 IU during 2h and 10mg abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case 1 IAT resulted in complete recanalisation of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> within 3h and complete resolution of symptoms in the following six weeks </plain></SENT>
