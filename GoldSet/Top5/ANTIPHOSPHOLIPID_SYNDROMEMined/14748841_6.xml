<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS is associated with the presence of antibodies to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> that may affect the outcome of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Rat embryos were cultured within their yolk sacs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of two antiphosphatidylserine monoclonal aPS antibodies (HL5B, RR7F) regarding their influence on growth and apoptotic events of the yolk sacs, as well as on growth and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the embryos, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure of rat embryos and their yolk sacs to aPS inhibited yolk sac growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased number of apoptotic events of giant cells in the aPS-exposed ectoplacental cone was found in comparison with control IgG-exposed giant cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant damage was observed in the embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aPS affect growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of rat ectoplacental cone </plain></SENT>
