<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some European countries, the drug used in secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis is acenokumarol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and 21 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were on long-term OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This OAC was interrupted 2 days before elective surgery and since that day half of the individual therapeutic dose of LMWH was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day of surgery, the LMWH therapeutic dose was divided into two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Starting with day 2 after surgery, the patient was again given half of the individual dose of LMWH every 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 4, OAC was additionally included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both drugs were administered until stabilization of international normalized ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic target for 2 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMWH was then interrupted, whereas OAC continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No symptoms or episodes of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhagic complications were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that our perioperative bridging therapy is safe and effective for prevention of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
