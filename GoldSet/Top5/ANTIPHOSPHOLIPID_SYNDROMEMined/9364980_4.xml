<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> is associated with an increased risk of both arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who were divided into two groups depending on the presence (n = 19) or absence (n = 13) of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy volunteers (n = 12) matched by age and sex served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects LA and IgG class anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation was monitored ex vivo measuring fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 (F1 + 2) in blood emerging from a skin microvasculature injury, collected at 30 second intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> mean FPA and F1 + 2 concentrations were significantly higher at most blood sampling times than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some SLE patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> the process of thrombin generation was clearly disturbed and very high concentrations of fibrinopeptide A were detected already in the first samples collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two minutes after skin incision SLE patients without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> produced slightly more FPA, but not F1 + 2, as compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mathematical model applied to analyze the thrombin generation kinetics revealed that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> patients generated significantly greater amounts of thrombin than healthy controls (p = 0.02 for either marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the same patients generation of thrombin in recalcified plasma in vitro was delayed pointing to the role of endothelium in the phenomenon studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data show for the first time that in SLE patients with antiphospholipid-protein antibodies thrombin generation after small blood vessel injury is markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Enhanced thrombin generation might explain thrombotic tendency observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
