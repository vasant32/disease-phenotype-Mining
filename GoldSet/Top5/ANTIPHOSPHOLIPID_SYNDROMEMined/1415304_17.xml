<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful pregnancies have been reported with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), but failure has also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this prospective study was to define the efficacy of such combination therapy in the prevention of pregnancy loss related to aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive pregnant patients with a minimum of one pregnancy loss and at least two positive aCL determinations more than 3 months apart, and in whom other causes of pregnancy loss were ruled out, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aCL concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, at a dosage of 40 mg/d, for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose was then tapered down 10 mg every 4 weeks, and then to a maintenance dose of 5 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also received aspirin, 81 mg/d, throughout the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Babies were evaluated during the pregnancy by measurement of fetal heart rate and ultrasonography, and after the delivery by measurement of weight and Apgar scores, and, in some cases, by arterial gasometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients with a mean (+/- SD) age of 33.2 +/- 5.01 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior to therapy, the rate of live-born babies was 15.6% (32 previous fetal losses and 5 live-born babies), and, after therapy, it was 100% (12 pregnancies and 12 live-born babies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant adverse effects to either mothers or babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had positive aCL determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had positive IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The levels of the antibodies decreased during treatment in these nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IgM aCL determinations were positive in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The levels of this isotype decreased in eight patients (90%) during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and aspirin appears to be efficacious, safe, and economic in the prevention of pregnancy loss and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> in patients with aCL </plain></SENT>
