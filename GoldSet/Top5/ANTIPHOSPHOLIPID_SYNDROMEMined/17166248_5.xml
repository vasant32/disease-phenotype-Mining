<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Routinely available coagulation assays are not capable of detecting clinically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of global coagulation assays have been developed with the potential to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, which predisposes to the common clinical events of arterial and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the overall hemostatic potential (OHP) assay would show abnormal fibrin generation and lysis in patients with clinically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the OHP assay as described by Blomb√§ck and colleagues [1,2] in 161 clinically hypercoagulable patients with arterial or VTE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma donors were tested for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We derived three new assay parameters for correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>: the maximum optical density, maximum slope, and delay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of fibrin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found significantly different assay results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients' parameters examined when compared with controls, indicating both increased fibrin generation and reduced fibrinolysis in hypercoagulable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings were similar whether samples were collected in association with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic event or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Estimated assay sensitivity for detection of a clinically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> was 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The OHP assay is a simple, inexpensive global test that is useful for assessing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> including APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OHP results are significantly abnormal in hypercoagulable groups compared with controls, indicating that both increased fibrin generation and reduced fibrinolysis contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The assay may ultimately assist in tailoring clinical management to patients' individual requirements </plain></SENT>
