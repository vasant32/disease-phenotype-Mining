<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of treated pregnancies in women with well-characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 82 consecutive pregnancies in 54 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> who were treated during pregnancy with the following: 1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin; 2) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin; 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and low-dose aspirin; or 4) other combinations of these medications or immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall neonatal survival rate was 73%, excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, but treatment failures (fetal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal deaths</z:hpo>) occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with successful treated pregnancies had fewer previous fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> than those with unsuccessful treated pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in outcome among the four treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">Preeclampsia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> occurred in half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnancies, and fetal growth impairment occurred in nearly one-third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>Preterm delivery</z:hpo> due to maternal or fetal indications was required in 37% of the pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four pregnancies were also complicated by postpartum <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> appears to be improved by treatment, but fetal loss may occur despite treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">Preeclampsia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e>, fetal growth impairment, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature delivery</z:hpo> are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the clinically significant risk of thrombotic episodes, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prophylaxis should be considered in these patients </plain></SENT>
