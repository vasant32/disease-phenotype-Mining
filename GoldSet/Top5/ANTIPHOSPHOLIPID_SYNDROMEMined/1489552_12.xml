<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies on the mechanism of action of these autoantibodies suggest that we are dealing with a new autoimmune syndrome which may occur either in a primary form or in the context of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> have been found in elderly subjects, who are known to display increased frequency of autoimmune phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is well known that many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, including SLE, are associated with HLA antigens, particularly with HLA-B8,DR3 phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our study, <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> serum levels were analyzed in 26 old subjects and in 56 young ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that HLA-B8,DR3-positive young females display significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> than HLA-B8,DR3-negative ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the same is true for elderly subjects on the whole with respect to young individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that HLA-B8,DR3-positive subjects (mainly female) as well as old subjects display (also in the absence of any clinical manifestation), multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunctions</z:e> that may underlie the predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
