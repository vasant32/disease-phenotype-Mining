<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> often first occur during pregnancy with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) and low-dose aspirin are considered as first-line treatments for pregnant women with APS and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to an increased incidence of hemorrhagic side-effects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> there are a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011609" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug eruptions</z:e> with cutaneous components secondary to the use of UFH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these eruptions has been classified as a delayed type I.V. hypersensitivity reactions at the sites of UFH injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of these reactions occur in pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We present three pregnant patients who developed delayed hypersensitivity reactions at the sites of UFH injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients had documented APS and the other patient had two previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings in the biopsy specimens from the sites of the delayed reactions were distinctive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory infiltrate contained CD3+ and CD4+ lymphoid cells with plasma cells, and eosinophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a marked increased in mast cells with increased stromal cells within the dermis and increased vascular proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distinctive histopathologic and immunohistochemical features seen in the delayed hypersensitivity reactions at the sites of UFH injections may be modulated by the immunomodulatory effects of UFH as well as the hormonal levels and cytokine patterns during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternative therapies may not always be successful in resolving the reactions </plain></SENT>
