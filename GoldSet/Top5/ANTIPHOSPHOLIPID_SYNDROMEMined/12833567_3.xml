<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and react against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins such as beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recognition of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) by platelet factor 4-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-Hc) has been previously evoked and partially confirmed by the present inhibition studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies were purified from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> using Affi-gel-10-beta2GPI immunoaffinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified anti-beta2GPI IgM as well as patient serum equally recognized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-Hc in ELISA mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to substantiate this data and to better understand we studied an animal model using mouse active immunization with the purified human anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mice showed a significant decrease in their platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition the ELISA responses of the immunized mice sera were positive against both beta2GPI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-Hc, substantiating the double recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite many previous reported animal model studies, this is the first time we have shown the specific recognition of anti-beta2GPI antibodies by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-Hc, the results in the induced mice correlating the data observed with some patients </plain></SENT>
