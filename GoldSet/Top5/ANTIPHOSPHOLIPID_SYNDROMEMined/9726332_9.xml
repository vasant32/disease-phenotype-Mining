<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) complicated by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were identified from a database of patients attending outpatients over the period 1978 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, and response to medical treatment and/or splenectomy were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 17 patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; splenectomy was performed on 13: 9 with SLE, 3 with PAPS, and 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease (LLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After splenectomy, six of nine patients with SLE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with PAPS gained complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no complications from splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients, three with SLE and one with PAPS, remained in a stable partial or full remission with oral medication and did not require splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study re-emphasizes the place for splenectomy in SLE patients and supports its role in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in PAPS </plain></SENT>
