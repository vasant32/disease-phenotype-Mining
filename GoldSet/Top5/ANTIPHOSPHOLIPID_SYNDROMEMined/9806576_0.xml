<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Institutional practice at the outpatient clinic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, Niigata University Medical Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Patients with recurrent fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> who were positive for anticardiolipin antibody and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fertile women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Human leukocyte antigen class II genotype was determined using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): The frequencies of DRB1*0403 and DRB1*0410 were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DRB1*04 also was significantly higher in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for HLA-DQ genotype, the frequency of HLA-DQB1*0501 was significantly lower in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Human leukocyte antigen systems appear to be involved in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
