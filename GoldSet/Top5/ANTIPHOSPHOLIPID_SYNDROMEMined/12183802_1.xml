<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>HISTORY: A 56-year-old man was admitted for investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> radiating to the back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was known to suffer from APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and was therefore treated with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasound detected an area with low echogenicity in the region of the right adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A CAT scan identified this mass as an adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: Anticoagulation treatment was discontinued because the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and the patient's pain subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few days later, he experienced similar pain, this time radiating to the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was discovered in the left adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient developed symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo>, which subsided after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bilateral adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was considered to be secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> following thromboses in the venous system of the adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thromboses were due to the underlying APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy was resumed, and the patient's condition stabilised without further complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cessation of anticoagulation therapy in this patient paradoxically led to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, this time of the contralateral adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unilateral and, especially, bilateral adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> should give rise to the suspicion of thrombophilic disorders such as APS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT); for which careful anticoagulation is the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
