<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a study comparing the distribution of polymorphisms at codons 247 (Val247Leu) and 316 (Trp316Ser) of the β2GPI gene in a Caucasian Spanish population of PAPS patients and healthy controls, and then making correlations with the development of anti-β2GPI antibodies and other aPL and associated clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 57 PAPS patients and 100 control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of Val247Leu polymorphism, alleles (V and L) and genotypes (V/V, V/L, L/L) were similarly distributed in PAPS patients and controls (P = 0.66 and P = 0.22, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding Trp316Ser polymorphism, we found a higher percentage of patients with respect to controls expressing S allele (11.4 vs. 5%, P = 0.02) and T/S genotype (22.8 vs. 10%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when we compared T/T and T/S genotypes in PAPS patients, we found no differences regarding generation of anti-β2GPI, other aPL and clinical manifestations favoring any genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that among Spanish Caucasians, polymorphisms at codon 247 (Val247Leu) do not seem to influence PAPS pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, polymorphisms at codon 316 (Trp316Ser), by means of an increased S allele and T/S genotype presence in Spanish Caucasian patients, might play a role in the pathogenic development of PAPS, although mechanism would not involve an increased production of anti-β2GPI and other aPL </plain></SENT>
