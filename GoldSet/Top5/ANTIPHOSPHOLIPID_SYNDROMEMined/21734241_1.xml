<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of aPLs are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that 3 human monoclonal aPLs as well as IgG fractions from patients with the APS increase <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the intracellular toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and TLR8 in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously they induce the translocation of TLR7 or TLR8 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects depend on the uptake of aPLs into the endosome, subsequent activation of endosomal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, and generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a consequence cells are dramatically sensitized to ligands for TLR7 and TLR8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation delineates a novel signal transduction pathway in innate immunity originating from the endosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the overexpression of TLR7 can also be detected in plasmacytoid dendritic cells from patients with the APS ex vivo, our results provide an explanation for proinflammatory and procoagulant effects of aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because inappropriate expression of TLR7 has been implicated in the development of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, these findings may also be relevant for the understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
