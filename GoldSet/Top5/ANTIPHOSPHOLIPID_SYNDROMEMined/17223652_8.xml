<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS)-derived anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies on gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by gene profiling using microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies purified from sera of patients with PAPS or control IgG isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were incubated with HUVEC for 4 h before isolation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and processing for hybridisation to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A-2.0 arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed using a combination of the MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) and GeneSpring (Agilent) software programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For selected genes microarray data were confirmed by real-time PCR analysis or at the protein level by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 101 genes were found to be upregulated and 14 genes were downregulated twofold or more in response to anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of novel genes not previously associated with APS were induced, including chemokines CCL20, CXCL3, CX3CL1, CXCL5, CXCL2 and CXCL1, the receptors Tenascin C, OLR1, IL-18 receptor 1, and growth factors CSF2, CSF3 IL-6, IL1beta and FGF18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of downregulated genes were transcription factors/signalling molecules including ID2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the microarray results for selected genes (CSF3, CX3CL1, FGF18, ID2, SOD2, Tenascin C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a complex gene expression response in HUVEC to anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies with multiple chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-thrombotic and pro-adhesive genes regulated by these antibodies in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of these newly identified anti-beta(2)GPI antibody-regulated genes could contribute to the vasculopathy associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
