<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 27 pregnancies in 18 women with SLE in a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 30 years and most patients were nulliparous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 27 pregnancies were in disease remission at the time of booking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal impairment</z:e> was present in 7 pregnancies (6 women), of whom 2 were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> on dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>Gestational diabetes</z:hpo> developed in 4 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 6 cases of pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 5 with superimposed pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One woman developed intrapartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two women had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and suffered late fetal losses; in addition, they also developed SLE flares in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> in the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no maternal mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was one termination of pregnancy for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks (range, 24 to 40 weeks) and the mean birth weight was 3047 g; the median Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes of life, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were 5 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (IUGR), 4 of which occurred in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>congenital heart block</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a late fetal loss at 24 weeks in a woman with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> (7.4%) due to intervention for IUGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Good pregnancy outcomes can be expected in women with SLE in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Pre-pregnancy counselling is crucial to achieve this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pregnancies should still be considered high risk and be managed jointly between the obstetricians, the perinatologists and the physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In particular, those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> are at increased risk of IUGR, superimposed pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and preterm births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Co-existing APS augurs a poorer prognosis for pregnancy outcome, and may present atypically as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> in the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
