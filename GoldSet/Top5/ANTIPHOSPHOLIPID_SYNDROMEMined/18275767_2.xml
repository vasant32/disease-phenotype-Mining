<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The recommended treatment in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) after a thrombotic event is long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still not exactly known how to manage patients who remain stable for years and whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) decrease until becoming negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the course of the primary APS in a group of patients after anticoagulation therapy is discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ten patients with primary APS who had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the limbs (9) or in the aorta (1) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a minimum period of 12 months of anticoagulation therapy, this was discontinued if the patients were negative <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> during the follow-up in two consecutive measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients (60%) developed persistent negative <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four had transient risk factors (2 pregnant, 1 immobilization, 2 oral contraceptives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No new <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> episode was observed after a follow-up period of 21 +/- 4.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that anticoagulation can be discontinued in those patients with primary APS and persistent negative <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, especially if the thrombotic event was venous and occurred in association with a transient risk factor, such as immobilization or pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Extensive studies are required to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
