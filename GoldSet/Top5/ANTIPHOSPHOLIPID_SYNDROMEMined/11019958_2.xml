<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the nature of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) recognised by sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients (n = 15) was investigated and compared to rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta2-GPI was only recognised when bound to a high affinity binding support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on beta2-GPI recognised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APS patients was also dependent on disulphide bond integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digestion of beta2-GPI with elastase rapidly destroyed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) on beta2-GPI recognised by antibodies in 91% of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main cleavage occurred at tryptophan316-lysine317 in the fifth domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Digestion with staphylococcal V8 protease resulted in a 50% reduction in antibody binding in 81% of patients and the cleavage sites mainly involved the first domain of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was considerable variability in the recognition of six different species of beta2-GPI by serum from APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on beta2-GPI bound by APS sera appear conformationally determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but are quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in the regions of beta2-GPI that are recognised </plain></SENT>
