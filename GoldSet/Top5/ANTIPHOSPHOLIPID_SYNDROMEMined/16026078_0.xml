<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, in a case of circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, interpretation of the slightly abnormal APTT is important for precise diagnosis, although it is very difficult to interpret the data in the early stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we experienced a patient (female, age: 61) with strong anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and found spuriously elevated FDP and CRP in the patient's immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The information from the laboratory was invaluable in indicating the need for splenorectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another case with abnormalities in blood coagulation tests was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these experiences, we confirmed that our consultations are very important and can assist in the diagnosis of patients </plain></SENT>
