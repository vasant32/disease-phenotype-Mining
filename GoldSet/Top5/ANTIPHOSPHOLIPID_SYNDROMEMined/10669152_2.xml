<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (24%) had significant titers of one or several autoimmune markers at AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 16 (13%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of autoimmune markers did not correlate with presenting feature, response to treatment or long-term outcome of AITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (5%) developed seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> during follow-up, comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune haemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Grave's disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677607" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hashimoto's disease</z:e> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, three of these patients had isolated biological markers of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> they later developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual average incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> was 1% per patient-year in the entire group and 0.4% in the group of patients with no autoimmune markers at AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This low rate is probably due to careful assessment at diagnosis for concomitant overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend extensive screening for autoimmune markers at AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and careful follow-up of patients with autoimmune markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Routine screening for autoimmune markers during AITP follow-up is not necessary for patients with no autoimmune markers at AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> can complicate autoimmune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (AITP) or be diagnosed concomitantly with otherwise unremarkable AITP (1, 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency and prognostic value of isolated autoimmune markers (i.e. not associated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e>), particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA) at AITP <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or during follow-up is controversial (3-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For example, the committee organized by George et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(9) to write guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of AITP stated that the search for ANA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were of "uncertain appropriateness at diagnosis and during follow-up" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to help practicians to make decisions, we analyzed the frequency of autoimmune markers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and during the follow-up in 122 adults with AITP and no overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These consecutive patients were followed by the same physician for a mean period of 6 years, and had routine screening tests for autoimmune markers and disorders at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, before steroid therapy, and regularly during follow-up </plain></SENT>
