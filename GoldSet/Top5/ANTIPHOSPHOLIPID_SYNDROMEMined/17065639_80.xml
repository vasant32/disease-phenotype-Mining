<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of oral anticoagulation in patients with idiopathic venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Testing of D-dimer levels may play a role in the assessment of the need for prolonged anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed D-dimer testing 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> who had received a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer level did not resume anticoagulation, whereas those with an abnormal D-dimer level were randomly assigned either to resume or to discontinue treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study outcome was the composite of recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during an average follow-up of 1.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The D-dimer assay was abnormal in 223 of 608 patients (36.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 events occurred among the 120 patients who stopped anticoagulation (15.0%), as compared with 3 events among the 103 patients who resumed anticoagulation (2.9%), for an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 14.6; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> recurred in 24 of 385 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer level (6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients who stopped anticoagulation, the adjusted hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> among those with an abnormal D-dimer level, as compared with those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer level, was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.15 to 4.46; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an abnormal D-dimer level 1 month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation have a significant incidence of recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, which is reduced by the resumption of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The optimal course of anticoagulation in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer level has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
