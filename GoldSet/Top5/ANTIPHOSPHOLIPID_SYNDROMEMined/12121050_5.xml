<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five subjects were studied: 45 with primitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and 40 controls affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> secondary to known causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two groups were homogeneous for age, sex, and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects submitted to echo-color doppler of the carotid arteries, femoral arteries, and abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cases were then subdivided into three subgroups on the basis of the positivity to the three subpopulations of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrate that there is no correlation between aPL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The different positivity to aPL does not modify this conclusion </plain></SENT>
