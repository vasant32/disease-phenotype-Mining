<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the role beta2GP1 antibodies play in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with this syndrome, the clearance and binding of phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing target membranes were monitored in beta2GP1-immune mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clearance in immune mice (T(1/2)4.8 min) was faster than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (T(1/2)11.0 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of PS vesicles recovered from immune mice by sequencing and Western blotting showed the presence of bound beta2GP1 and autologous antibody, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> times in immune mice were approximately 30% shorter than in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro clotting times, however, were the same in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine if the in vivo results could be attributed to the interaction of autoantibodies with the vascular endothelium, the binding of PS-containing target membranes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and apoptotic endothelial cells was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While endothelial cells bound PS vesicles, beta2GP1 reduced uptake by approximately 50% in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and apoptotic endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of beta2GP1 antibodies, however, uptake in apoptotic cells, but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, increased by more than two-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> could, in part, be due to antibody-dependent cross-linking of beta2GP1 bound to PS-expressing cells and the vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
