<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 82 patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG aPS/PT were detected in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DQB1, DQA1, and DRB1 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were compared with 177 matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG aPS/PT were present in 41 of 82 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of DQB1*0301/4, DQB1*0604/5/6/7/9, and DRB1*1302 alleles were increased in patients with aPS/PT compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To minimize the interference of the association between anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) and HLA, patients with anti-beta2GPI were excluded from further analyses, and only HLA-DQB1*0301/4 remained significant compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-6.5, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the haplotype analysis, HLA-DQB1*0301/4;DQA1* 0301/2;DRB1*04 was significantly increased in patients with IgG aPS/PT compared with controls (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.72-13.10, P = 0.0063) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA-DQB1*0301/4;DQA1*0301/ 2;DRB1*04 haplotype and its components may influence the production of aPS/PT in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, which partly explains the correlation between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and DQB1*03 </plain></SENT>
