<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Female Balb/C mice were immunized once with beta2-GPI in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or with CFA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four months after immunization the mice were tested in the staircase apparatus and the following two variables were measured: (1) number of rears: and (2) number of stairs climbed by the mice </plain></SENT>
