<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ab associated with primary APS (pAPS) seem to show a restricted specificity (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>/beta2-GPI-complexes), whereas those in secondary APS (sAPS) react additionaly with pure beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, beta2-GPI-independent Ab were also frequently present in both conditions (50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ab-positive sera) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In CTD patients, the reactivity profile "pure beta2-GPI + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>/beta2-GPI-complexes" is significantly associated with clinically manifest sAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine as antigenic target, the overall concordance (crossreactivity?) between both assays was lower than expected (52%), being highest in pAPS (87%) and sAPS (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, a two-step procedure for reliable serological diagnosis of APS could be recommended: Ab-screening using a mix of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> complexed with beta2-GPI (sensitivity &gt; 90% for Ab concentrations above 20 U/ml) followed by an assay allowing the simultaneous detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant antigenic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificities </plain></SENT>
