<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there is a well-documented link between the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the presence of beta2GPI-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies, the pathological impact of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> affinity-chromatography, we isolated and identified 3 CL-binding proteins, complement component C4, complement factor H and a kallikrein-sensitive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, and tested for the presence of autoantibodies against these proteins in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High titers of autoantibodies to C4 as compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls were present in 3 of 26 patients with APS, and weak titers were found in 2 of 26 patients with SLE and in none of 26 patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to complement factor H were found in 4 APS, 3 SLE and none of the other autoimmune patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to kallikrein-sensitive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> were detected in 6 APS patients, 1 SLE patient, and 1 patient with another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A close relationship between these antibodies was found, suggesting their origin from a common macromolecular complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no relationship with anti-beta2GPI antibodies was found, with the three patients with higher levels of autoantibodies having a low titer of anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, some patients with APS harbor circulating antibodies to other CL-binding proteins which might be useful to further characterize these patients </plain></SENT>
