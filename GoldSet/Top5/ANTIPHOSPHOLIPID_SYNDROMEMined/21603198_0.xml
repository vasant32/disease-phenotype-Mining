<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between prolactin (PRL) and the immune system has been demonstrated in the last two decades and has opened new windows in the field of immunoendocrinology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are scarce reports about PRL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (pAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate PRL levels in patients with pAPS compared to healthy controls and to investigate their possible clinical associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five pAPS patients according to Sapporo criteria were age- and sex-matched with 41 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with secondary causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000870'>hyperprolactinemia</z:hpo> (HPRL) were excluded; demographic, biometric, and clinical data, PRL levels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, inflammatory markers, and other routine laboratory findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRL levels were similar between pAPS and healthy controls (8.94 ± 7.02 versus 8.71 ± 6.73 ng/mL, P = .876) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine percent of the pAPS patients and 12.1% of the control subjects presented HPRL (P = .740) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the pAPS patients with hyper- and normoprolactinemia revealed no significant differences related to anthropometrics, clinical manifestations, medications, smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study showed that HPRL does not seem to play a role in clinical manifestations of the pAPS, differently from other autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
