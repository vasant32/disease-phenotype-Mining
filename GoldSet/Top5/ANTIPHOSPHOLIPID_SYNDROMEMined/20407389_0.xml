<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data on thyroid involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are scarce and inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of thyroid dysfunction and antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and the association of these alterations with clinical and immunologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group included 50 PAPS patients (44 females) with a mean age of 39.7 +/- 11.5 years and mean disease duration of 77.3 +/- 63.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data related to thyroid dysfunction and PAPS were obtained by chart review, patient interview, and clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of TSH, free T4, antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), antithyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), thyroid receptor antibody (TRAb), and antiphospholipid autoantibodies were analyzed by standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> among patients and found 22% (11 patients) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the latter patients and the euthyroid group about demographic findings, disease duration, thrombotic or obstetric events, and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> as well as prevalence of thyroid auto antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies found was 6 patients (12%) with TgAb, 5 with TPOAb (10%), and 2 patients (4%) with both TgAb and TPOAb, comprising 18% of positivity of at least one of the auto antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo> is present among 22% of PAPS patients and thyroid autoantibodies in 18% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a common pathophysiologic mechanism between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
