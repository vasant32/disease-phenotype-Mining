<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical course of adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (AH) by using a systematic review of the presentation, associated conditions, and outcomes in patients with AH seen at our institution between 1972 and 1997 (a 25-year period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A computer search of recorded dismissal diagnoses identified 204 patients with a diagnosis of AH, but only 141 fulfilled our study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their records were analyzed systematically by presentation, bilateral or unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AH is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity that occurs in the postoperative period, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, in <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, or in the setting of severe physical stress and multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard laboratory evaluation is not helpful in establishing the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 141 cases of AH, 78 were bilateral, and 63 were unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment in situations of severe stress or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> had little effect on outcome (9% vs. 6% survival with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is in sharp contrast to AH occurring postoperatively (100% vs. 17% survival with or without treatment, respectively) or in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (73% vs. 0% survival, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion is required to make a timely diagnosis of AH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in the appropriate clinical setting necessitate further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the diagnosis of AH is infrequently made while the patient is alive, appropriate imaging techniques are useful for establishing a timely diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In severe physical stress or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, AH may be a marker of severe, preterminal physiologic stress and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
