<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric manifestations can occur in up to two-thirds of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presentations as well as the underlying immunopathogenic mechanisms can be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and therefore have an enormous impact on therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PICTURE: We describe 2 patients who presented similarly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> binocular reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient had anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, while the second patient suffered from posterior reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT: Patient one was treated with anti-coagulation and immunosuppression while the second patient required the withdrawal of immunosuppression and supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: Both patients responded favourably and had complete visual recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Different management strategies have to be employed for similar presentations having different aetiologies, underscoring the need for constant clinical vigilance </plain></SENT>
