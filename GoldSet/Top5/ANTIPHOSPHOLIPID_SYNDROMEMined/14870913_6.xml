<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TIFI is a PL-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> spanning the Thr101-Thr120 of ulb0-hcmva from human cytomegalovirus (CMV), which shares structural similarity with the PL-binding site of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunization with this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> induced pathogenic aPL and anti-beta2GPI antibodies in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These antibodies activated endothelial cells and enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo, but whether these antibodies cause fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in mice is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of these antibodies on pregnancy outcome in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups of pregnant BALB/c mice were injected with either hybridoma supernatant containing D3/AC10, a CMV-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-induced monoclonal aPL, at days four, eight and 12 of the pregnancy, 100 microg per mouse (study group) or with culture media alone (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002288'>litter size</z:mp> was significantly smaller in the study group (4.80 +/- 1.15 versus 7.28 +/- 0.18, t = - 2.526, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aPL induced by CMV <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> may have pathogenic properties similar to human autoimmune aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further support the hypothesis that at least in some patients with APS, pathogenic aPL antibodies may be generated by immunization with CMV products during incidental exposure to the virus via a molecular mimicry mechanism </plain></SENT>
