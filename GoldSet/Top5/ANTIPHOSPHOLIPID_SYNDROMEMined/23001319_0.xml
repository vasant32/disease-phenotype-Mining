<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five hospital laboratories, located in a North-Italy area and using the same method for LA testing, cooperated to standardise sample treatment and analytical procedure in order to define the upper values for LA negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: In total, 200 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (40 for each centre) were studied for six LA functional assays, using the same procedure, reagent lot and analyser type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first tests done were LA screen and LA confirm assays, based on diluted Russell's Viper Venom Time, with low and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second tests performed were <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> clotting time screen and confirm assays, based on activated partial thromboplastin time, with low and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, two mixing assays were executed for both screening assays, diluting patient sample with a pool prepared with plasma collected from the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Data analysis demonstrated a difference between centres for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays when results were expressed in seconds; the difference disappeared when results are normalised with the local mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value of each centre and are expressed as a normalised ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study population was normally distributed; so the value corresponding to 99th percentile was used as limit value for LA negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Values expressed as normalised ratio, for LA and <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> clotting time screenings were 1.22 and 1.23, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The study allowed us to define a uniform approach to LA testing and evaluation for laboratories employing the same methods </plain></SENT>
