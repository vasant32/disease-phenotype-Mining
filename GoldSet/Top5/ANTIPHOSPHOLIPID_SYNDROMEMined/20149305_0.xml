<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES:The 2006 revised criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) provide a new classification challenge, and studies validating the updated criteria against the older ones are still scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the 1999 preliminary with the 2006 revised classification criteria for APS, and evaluated if the revised criteria provide an added value over the original ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A laboratory-based registry population was obtained on the basis of the positivity of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were analysed for fulfillment of the 1999 and 2006 classification criteria for APS, non-criteria features of APS, and autoantibody profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 144 aPL-positive identified patients, 119 had at least 2 aPL tests on separated occasions, and were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the 1999 criteria, 23 patients had APS (15 had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone, 4 pregnancy morbidity, and 4 both); while 26 fulfilled the 2006 revised criteria (15 had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone, 5 pregnancy morbidity, and 6 both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> who met 1999 criteria did not meet those of 2006 (aCL positivity but not &gt;12 weeks apart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, other with pregnancy morbidity, and 2 with both only fulfilled the 2006 criteria because they had isolated anti-Beta(2)GPI antibody-positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High concordance between criteria was found, with kappa index of 0.87 (95%; CI, 0.76-0.98).CONCLUSIONS: The 2006 revised criteria represent a step-forward since it allows the inclusion of patients with anti-Beta(2)GPI antibodies as an isolated serological feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a wider time interval between serologic tests seems unlikely to make differences </plain></SENT>
