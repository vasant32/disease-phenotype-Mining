<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune causes have been suggested as a factor in some of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High rates of intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies from sera of SLE/APS patients affect reproductive outcome in pregnant mice, as was studied in vivo, where injection of immunoglobulin (Ig)G purified from patients with APS to mice caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to investigate the direct effect of IgG purified from women with SLE or APS on the growth and viability of embryos, we cultured 11.5-day old-rat embryos in their yolk sacs in the presence of IgG purified from SLE and APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG purified from SLE and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients affected directly the embryo and yolk sac reducing their growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purified IgG positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/anti-DNA antibodies reduced yolk sac and embryonic growth more than sera negative for these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Various <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> affect differently the growth and development of the embryo and the placenta </plain></SENT>
