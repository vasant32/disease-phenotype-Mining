<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether variation in the HLA-DM gene is important in producing a group of pathogenic autoantibodies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL)-on the basis that HLA class II restricted antigen presentation is involved in the production of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-DMA and DMB polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction combined with restriction enzyme digestion in 51 white patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), 82 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (42 with APS and 40 without APS), and 109 healthy white controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association with the aPL profile was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of DMA alleles in APS patients and in patients with APS associated with SLE was significantly different from that in controls by 4x2 chi(2) test with 3 degrees of freedom (p = 0.035 and 0.011, respectively), but it was not different between SLE patients without APS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allelic distribution of DMA was also different between patients with IgG class anticardiolipin antibody or those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and controls (p = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and between patients with and without LA among SLE patients (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these differences included the increase in DMA*0102 in the former groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that HLA-DMA*0102 or its linked gene(s) form one of the genetic risks for the production of aPL </plain></SENT>
