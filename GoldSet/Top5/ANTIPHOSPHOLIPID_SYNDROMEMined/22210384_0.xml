<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than half of childhood APS occurs as secondary APS complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We encountered a boy with SLE who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) due to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was initially diagnosed with SLE and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, his renal function rapidly deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since poikilocytes were detected, we suspected that his condition was complicated by <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> or APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urgent plasma exchange, continuous hemodialysis, and intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> saved the patient and his <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> ameliorated </plain></SENT>
