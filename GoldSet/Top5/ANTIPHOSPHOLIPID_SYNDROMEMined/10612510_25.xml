<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the efficacy of an aggressive systematic regimen for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonarteritic central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CRAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients who had unilateral CRAO with symptoms of fewer than 48 hours' duration were treated with an aggressive stepwise systematic regimen until <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation improved or until <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the treatment steps were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients with unilateral CRAO and symptoms of fewer than 48 hours' duration were treated in the same institution in an arbitrary nonsystematic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic steps of the aggressive treatment included ocular massage, sublingual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi>, intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> or oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, anterior chamber paracentesis, intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> followed by streptokinase, and retrobulbar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28502">tolazoline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After each step, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> flow was evaluated by three-mirror contact lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nonsystematic treatment was arbitrary and included one or several of the above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and complete eye examination data were recorded before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterial supply were improved in eight (73%) of the 11 patients treated in the stepwise systematic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients in whom visual acuity improved had symptoms for fewer than 12 hours, and the presumed cause was either platelet-derived or cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> from atheroma or the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom visual acuity did not improve had CRAO that was attributed to calcified emboli or primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and had symptoms more than 12 hours before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity did not improve in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients with the nonsystematic treatment regardless of the presumed cause or duration of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The success of the treatment in the systematic treatment group was statistically significantly better compared with the outcome of the nonsystematic treated group (Fischer exact test, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of CRAO, an aggressive systematic regimen including medical and mechanical means may reestablish <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulation and improve visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, the nature of occlusive emboli, and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> may determine the visual outcome, but a larger series is warranted to verify the effectiveness of the treatment and the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
