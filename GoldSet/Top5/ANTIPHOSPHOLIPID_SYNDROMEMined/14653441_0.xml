<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>New synthetic direct and indirect factor Xa or factor IIa inhibitors are increasingly used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders, including patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effects of the synthetic direct factor Xa inhibitor DX-9065a, the indirect synthetic heparinomimetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35369">pentasaccharide</z:chebi>, and the direct factor IIa inhibitor Argatroban were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two widely used assays for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, namely the tissue thromboplastin inhibition (TTIT) and the dilute Russell viper venom tests (DRWT) proved useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drugs were added to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma pool ranging in concentration from 0.04 to 10 microg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the two tests named above, DX-9065a and Argatroban showed a dose-related prolongation of TTIT and DRWT in the concentration range from 0.04 to 5 micromol/mL, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35369">pentasaccharide</z:chebi> only slightly prolonged the clotting times of these assays even at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Argatroban had the more pronounced effect on both tests when compared with DX-9065a (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most responsive assay for DX-9065a up to a concentration of 2.5 micromol/mL was the DRWT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For Argatroban both TTIT and DRWT were equally responsive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients whose plasma was tested for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and who have been given DX-9065a or Argatroban may have false-positive results with the TTIT tests and DRWT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect should be considered during patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that these assays could be used for the effective quantitation of the direct factor Xa or factor IIa inhibitors when suitable controls are used </plain></SENT>
