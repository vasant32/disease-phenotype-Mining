<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed levels of coagulation activation markers and aPL during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and in women with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations in aPL levels were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No particular pattern of antibody positivity, or fluctuation in aPL level, was associated with poor pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase was observed in levels of factor Xlla (FXIIa; P &lt; 0.001), factor VIIa (FVIIa, P &lt; 0.001), thrombin antithrombin complexes (TAT; P &lt; 0.001), prothrombin fragment F1.2 (F1.2; P &lt; 0.001) and D-dimer (DD; P &lt; 0.05) during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor VIIa, TAT, F1.2 and DD increased significantly before 20 weeks gestation, while a statistically significant increase in FXIIa levels was first detected between weeks 20 and 30 of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pregnant women with aPS, increases in FXIIa were similar to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy, but increased FVIIa levels were not observed until after 30 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy, increased levels of TAT and F1.2 were detected in aPS pregnancies before 20 weeks gestation, but increased DD were not observed until after week 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, women with aPS receiving low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis had significantly higher (P = 0.02) levels of TAT (median 8.6; interquartile range (IQR) 6.5-20.8) between weeks 20 and 30 of gestation compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant population (median 5.9; IQR 4.7-7.9), thus indicating increased thrombin generation in women with aPS in mid-pregnancy </plain></SENT>
