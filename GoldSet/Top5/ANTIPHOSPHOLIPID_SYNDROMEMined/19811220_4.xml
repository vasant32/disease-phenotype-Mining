<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are procoagulant, pro-inflammatory and could contribute to pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the number, cellular origin and procoagulant activity of MPs on DVT patients in different clinical situations: at diagnosis (n = 9, 5F/4M; mean age = 41.11), 1-3 years after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> withdrawal (n = 10, 7F/3M; mean age = 32.90), associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS; n = 11, 9F/2M; mean age = 33.82), or asymptomatic carriers of Factor V Leiden (FVL; n = 7, 7F/0M; mean age = 34.00) vs healthy controls (CTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The quantification and characterization were performed by flow cytometry using CD235, CD61, CD45, CD31, CD14, CD45, anti-TF and Annexin V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasmatic procoagulant activity was investigated by prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MPs procoagulant activity was analyzed by D-dimer (DD2) and Thrombin Generation Test (TGT) on a healthy pool of plasmas adjusted or not by their number (10,000 MPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MPs percentages were not different between the groups, but absolute number was increased in patients 1-3 years after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> withdrawal vs CTR (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference of the MPs cellular origin comparing patients to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TGT using 10,000 MPs was lower on these patients (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>APS patients showed a reduction of plasmatic procoagulant activity (P = 0.004), but they were under <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DD2 in the presence of MPs, independently of its number, was higher in patients with DVT at diagnosis (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MPs of patients with spontaneous DVT at diagnosis can promote coagulation activation demonstrated by increased DD2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even the increased MPs from patients 1-3 years after thrombotic episode generated lower amount of thrombin, they can have a protective effect by activation of Protein C <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> pathway </plain></SENT>
