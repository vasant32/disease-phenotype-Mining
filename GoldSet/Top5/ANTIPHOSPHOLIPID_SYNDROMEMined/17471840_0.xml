<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a case of a 50-year-old man who was diagnosed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> on the basis of serologic findings and results of diagnostic imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms in the form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>, disorders of orientation, and pyramidal-type bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> more evident on the left side were reported by the patient over a period of two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed numerous vascular foci located in the cortical-subcortical areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound (USG) disclosed a large, irregular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> adhering to the margins of the mitral valve with signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aCL (high titers in both classes), LA, and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (a-beta2GPI) were found in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>a-beta2GPI and anti-nDNA antibodies were disclosed in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combined <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-aggregation therapy was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was then decided to use immunosuppression with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and methylprednisone pulses every 4 weeks (7 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>USG at follow-up showed marked regression of the mitral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with swollen margins of the mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI of the brain confirmed progression of the lesions described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> associated most probably with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It should be remembered, however, that diagnostic criteria for APL and SLE partially overlap </plain></SENT>
