<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence, isotype distribution, and clinical significance of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in two populations of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 160 Colombians and 160 Spaniards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sera were tested in our laboratory by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL, as well as IgG and IgM anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive results for at least 1 of the 3 aCL isotypes were found in 40 Colombians (25%) and 55 Spaniards (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL was the predominant isotype in both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive results for at least 1 of the anti-beta2GPI isotypes were found in 34 Colombians (21%) and 29 Spaniards (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI was the dominant isotype in Colombians, while IgM was predominant in Spaniards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positivity for anti-beta2GPI in aCL-positive patients was present in 77% in the Colombian group and 50% in the Spaniard group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among Colombians, IgG aCL and anti-beta2GPI correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among Spaniards, IgG aCL and IgG anti-beta2GPI correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss, aCL ELISA was more sensitive than anti-beta2GPI in Spaniards, and anti-beta2GPI ELISA was more specific than aCL in both populations </plain></SENT>
