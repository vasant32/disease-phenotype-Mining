<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The positively charged lysine-rich fifth domain of beta2GPI facilitates its interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes containing acidic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, which normally become exposed by apoptotic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, atomic force microscopy was applied to visualize the binding of beta2GPI to a mixed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> model membrane at physiological ionic strength </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of kinetic constants using surface plasmon resonance revealed that the binding can be described by a two-state reaction model, i.e. a very fast interaction step, depending on the content of acidic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the bilayer, and a second step with significantly lower k(on) and k(off) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest a biphasic interaction mechanism: a fast step of beta2GPI binding to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, mainly based on electrostatic interactions, and a slower phase of agglomeration of the protein on the bilayer surface accompanied by a protein-induced rigidification of the membrane, as revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
