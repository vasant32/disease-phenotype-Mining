<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Introduction of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) has improved the standardization of laboratory control of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (OAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been reported that misleading INR results can be obtained from OAT patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this claim, we studied 35 OAT patients, 14 of whom had anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) with a documented LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attainment of anticoagulation was confirmed by chromogenic assay of factor VII and factor X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin times were performed using eight thromboplastins (five derived from rabbit brain, two recombinant human tissue factor and one made from human placenta) with an International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of &lt;1.40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When using the thromboplastin manufacturers' ISI there was a significant difference (ANOVA, P&lt;0.0001) between INR results obtained with the eight reagents for both APS (average CV = 12.4%) and non-APS (average CV = 12.5%) patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variation using the eight thromboplastins was assessed by calculating the CV for each sample; these values were then pooled for each patient group to give the average CV for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reagents for the two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results for both patient groups exhibited markedly reduced variation (APS group average CV = 6.5%, non-APS group average CV = 5.8%) when locally assigned ISI values were employed in the calculation of INRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data does not support the suggestion that the INR may not reflect the true level of anticoagulation in the long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-treated patient, in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was strong evidence that thromboplastin use should be restricted to those clot detection systems for which the reagent's manufacturer has assigned an ISI, or local ISI assignment must be undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inappropriate use of a generic (i.e. optical or mechanical clot detection system without regard to specific analyser type) ISI value can lead to ambiguous results </plain></SENT>
