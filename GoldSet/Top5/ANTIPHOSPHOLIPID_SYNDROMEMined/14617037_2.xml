<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As soluble HLA-DR (sHLA-DR) molecules are reported to be implicated in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy disorders</z:e> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, we studied sHLA-DR plasma levels in pregnant women with APS (n = 14) and in women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy (n = 15), in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">high-risk pregnancies</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (PE; n = 20) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR; n = 10) and in fertile non-pregnant women (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sHLA-DR levels of pregnant women were assessed during the third trimester, at labor, in the first week, and in the third month of puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were compared with soluble CD95 ligand (sCD95L), an important signal molecule in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sHLA-DR levels in pregnant women with APS were approximately three times higher (mean 1.48 +/- 0.15 microg/ml) during the whole observation period than in fertile non-pregnant women (0.54 +/-.06 microg/ml) and nearly double in women with high risk (PE, 0.91 +/- 14 microg/ml; IUGR, 0.94 +/-.21 microg/ml) and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies (0.74 +/- 0.13 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sHLA-DR levels of pregnant women with APS were positively correlated with the serum concentration of anti-anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For sCD95L plasma levels, no substantial variations were found among the different groups above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In pregnant women with APS, however, sHLA-DR levels were positively correlated with sCD95L levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies should clarify the functional involvement of sHLA-DR molecules in the induction of CD95/CD95L-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway that may play a crucial role in the pathology of pregnancies complicated by APS </plain></SENT>
