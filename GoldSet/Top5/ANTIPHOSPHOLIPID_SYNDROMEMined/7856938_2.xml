<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the clinical value of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies type 5 (anti-M5), we carried out a retrospective study on 48 patients with these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of these 48 patients (35%) satisfied at least 4 criteria of the revised American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatism</z:e> Association classification of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine (61%) had at least one clinical manifestation of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome; thirteen had symptoms consistent with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome; five had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo>; five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans' syndrome</z:e>; four had auto-immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo>; two had immunologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the 48 patients had no clinical manifestations, but only anti-M5 and a false laboratory test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (FBTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that patients with anti-M5 have a high prevalence of: 1) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (42% had three or more deep thromboses) and fetal loss (21%); 2) auto-immune cytopenia with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (29%) and auto-immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> (54%); 3) laboratory markers of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (71%), FBTS (95%) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 32 patients with anti-M5, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibodies were also tested; 12 (38%) were positive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had IgG aCL, ie none had anti-beta 2GPI antibodies without aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of anti-beta 2GPI antibodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> among patients with anti-M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings suggest that anti-M5 is another marker of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even though the prevalence of anti-M5 is low, especially in SLE, it was the only marker of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome in two patients; this appears to justify routine screening for these antibodies </plain></SENT>
