<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Anti "nucleolar" antibodies are estimated to be present in about 5-10% of anti-nuclear antibodies-positive (ANA), but only in about 15% of cases (sometimes in lower percentages) it is possible to assess precisely the specificity of antibodies responsible for this pattern of ANA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nucleoli are composed of many proteins, e.g., nucleolin, fibrillarin, Pm-Scl (spliceosome component), <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-polymerases and different sizes rRNA transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nucleoli also contain annexins (ANX) II and V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of these proteins are target molecules for autoantibodies generated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (CTD)--especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to work out methods for differentiation of antibody specificities in the case of sera ANA-positive with the nucleolar pattern in indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), with a particular concern directed to anti-Annexin V antibodies (belonging to anticofactor antibody system--characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> [APS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the sera of the tested group of 12 (selected from 150 subjects suffering from different kinds of CTD) ANA-positive (Western-blott negative) and showing the nucleolar type of ANA pattern patients, the following autoantibodies were assessed: ANA-IIF, anti-Pm-Scl (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e> marker), anticardiolipin, antiannexin V, anti-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> using the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the use of the Western-blott method a basic set "marker" autoantibody in CTD was estimated, and the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase was used for elimination (by enzymatic digestion) of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-s and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-protein complexes--a possible target for autoantibodies giving the nucleolar pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 5 out of 12 sera (41.7%) of ANA-positive/Western-blott-negative CTD patients antibodies against Annexin V, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, Pm-Scl were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 out of 12 patient sera antibodies to the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the tested sera showed the presence of autoantibodies against antigen Scl-70 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> marker), and SS-A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren</z:e> syndrome marker), which can also give the atypical nucleolar ANA-pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only in few sera "my ositis"--blotts showed antibodies to antigen Ku (nuclear protein), Jo-1 and PI-7 (anti-tRNA synthetases--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> markers)--<z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 80% of tested sera the co-appearance of anti-ANX-V and anticardiolipin antibodies was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies against ANX-V together with Pm-Scl was confirmed in 60% of sera The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase, used as a specific rRNA and RNP-protein blocker, resulted in a partial or total disappearance of the "nucleolar" pattern, but independently of the tested serum specificity (anti-ANX-V, anti-Pm-Scl or both together) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase treatment of the Hep-2 cells effects are equivocal and they may result from either binding or digestion the antigen by the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-ase, but also from forming a sterical hindrance for the autoantigen binding to another "nucleolar" antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are interesting, especially as concerns anti-ANX-V autoantigens (associated with APS), but they require further research including bigger groups of CTD patients </plain></SENT>
