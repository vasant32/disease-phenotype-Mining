<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the perinatal outcomes in neonates born to mothers with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of pregnant women with APS and their offspring were retrospectively collected between January 1997 and July 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternal and perinatal histories including demographic data, medications, obstetric histories, and neonatal clinical manifestations and laboratory data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven women with a diagnosis of primary APS were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of these patients had experienced frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> (72.7%), and four had unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (36.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of them had vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific autoimmune antibodies were detected, including anticardiolipin antibody (n=6), anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (n=3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the pregnancies, five had preterm births (45.4%), two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (18.1%), and one had intrauterine fetal demise (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was noted in three babies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whose mothers had lower platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, seen on brain images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This limited study suggests that neonates born to mothers with primary APS are at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo>, and having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further large, prospective studies are required to better define the perinatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
