<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APLA are able to activate endothelial cells (EC) and induce an increase in the expression of inflammatory marker proteins, such as leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, tissue factor or the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on EC activation induced by APLA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG was purified from the plasma of six patients with APLA and from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EC were incubated with patient IgG or with control IgG, in the presence or absence of 5microM of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi>, and expression of the leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, analyzed by flow cytometry and by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of tissue factor and the chemokine <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 was analyzed by QRT-PCR alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of EC with patient IgG increased the expression of VCAM-1, E-selectin, tissue factor and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior treatment of the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> further increased the expression of these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> effect was reversed by co-incubation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25350">mevalonate</z:chebi> or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate and mimicked by the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that in cultured human EC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> increase the extent of inflammatory activation induced by APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be mediated by an inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on one or more geranylgeranylated protein(s) </plain></SENT>
