<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of disrupted beta(2)GPI activity in contributing to pregnancy pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the physiological requirement for functional beta(2)GPI in pregnancy was investigated by evaluating reproductive outcomes in beta(2)GPI null mutant (beta(2)GPI-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta(2)GPI-/- mice were fertile and carried viable fetuses to term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was an 18% reduction in the number of viable implantation sites in beta(2)GPI-/- mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0009431'>reduced fetal weight</z:mp> and fetal:placental weight ratio in late gestation, suggesting compromised placental function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Placental architecture was altered in beta(2)GPI-/- implantation sites with a 24% increase in the junctional zone: labyrinthine ratio, but placentae showed no evidence of increased <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the absence of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of beta(2)GPI genotype on pregnancy success after passive transfer of human and mouse antibodies reactive with beta(2)GPI was also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of five anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies induced pregnancy loss in beta(2)GPI+/+ mice but beta(2)GPI-/- mice were refractory to antibody-induced pregnancy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that functional beta(2)GPI is not essential for successful pregnancy in mice, but optimal placental development and fetal growth require this molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together these data are consistent with pathogenic mechanisms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> involving both neutralization of beta(2)GPI function and beta(2)GPI-immunoglobulin complex formation </plain></SENT>
