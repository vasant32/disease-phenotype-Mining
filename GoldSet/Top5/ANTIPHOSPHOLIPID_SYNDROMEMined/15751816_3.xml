<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present prospective cohort study the use of a low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) (nadroparin), administered alone twice daily in 30 pregnant women who were diagnosed with APS on the basis of the current classification criteria, is evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dosage was adjusted according to anti-Xa levels in the patients as the pregnancies progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three women, in whom an important gradual fall in platelet count in the first trimester did not respond to increased nadroparin doses, were shifted to a second-line treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal loss occurred in two of the 27 remaining women (7.40%), while 25 (92.59%) delivered 25 live infants, between the 32nd and 40th <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135241" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">weeks of gestation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No fetal problems were registered during pregnancies, while maternal complications occurred in two of the 25 patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were no thrombotic events in any of the women during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient compliance was good and only minor side-effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that nadroparin alone is useful and safe in the management of pregnant patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in consideration of the good pregnancy outcome obtained in patients with only pregnancy morbidity when <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin were used together, other studies comparing nadroparin twice daily with once daily plus Aspirin would be useful to ascertain which is more effective in these patients </plain></SENT>
