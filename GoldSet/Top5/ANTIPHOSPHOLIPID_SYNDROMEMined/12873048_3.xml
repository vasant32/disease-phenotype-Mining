<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether aPL antibodies could be detected in the serum as well as BALF of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury (ALI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anticardiolipin, IgG anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, IgG antiphosphatidic acid and IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were detected by ELISA in low titers within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the BALF and serum of nine patients with ALI and 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient suffered from severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high aPL antibody levels in serum possibly triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> were associated with high aPL antibody levels in BALF, which can be explained by high capillary-alveolar permeability </plain></SENT>
