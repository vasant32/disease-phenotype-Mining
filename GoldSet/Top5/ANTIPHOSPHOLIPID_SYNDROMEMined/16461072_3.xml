<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients presenting with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion were screened for vascular risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>) and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL): anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a serum sample positive for aPL returned at least 6 weeks later for a new screening to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed to determine the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients presented with RVO, 16 had vascular risk factors for RVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After two screenings for aPL, nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> associated with RVO were diagnosed (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were over age 50 years and none had a previous thrombotic event before RVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with aspirin (160 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a mean follow-up of 26.1+/-8.2 months (range, 16-36 months), there were no recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> venous occlusion is multifactorial in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients aged 50 years and older, without previous thrombotic event, aPL might not be predictive of recurrences and treatment with aspirin might be sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In such patients, the routine screening for aPL does not appear warranted, but a randomized study should be conducted to really ascertain the pathogenic role of aPL and the most appropriate treatment in RVO </plain></SENT>
