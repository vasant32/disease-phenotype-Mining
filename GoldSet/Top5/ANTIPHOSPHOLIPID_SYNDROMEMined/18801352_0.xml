<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we examined whether hsCRP, C3, C4 and anti-oxLDL antibodies could discriminate between PAPS and SAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included: 44 patients with PAPS and 20 patients with SAPS associated with SLE and 37 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels were estimated by ELISA, while C3, C4 and hsCRP were determined by immunonephelometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SAPS patients had significantly elevated hsCRP (mg/L) concentrations in comparison to PAPS patients (8.00 (7.00-15.00) vs. 2.27 (0.68-6.89), Mann-Whitney, p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of hsCRP should be mandatory in the follow-up of SAPS patients in order to identify a subset with a high cardiovascular risk and in PAPS in order to identify patients with a risk of evolving to SLE </plain></SENT>
