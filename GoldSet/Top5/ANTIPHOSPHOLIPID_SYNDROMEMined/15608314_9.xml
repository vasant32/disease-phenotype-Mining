<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs), their relationship with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and/or the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), and the clinical use of the ABI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (primary APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An 8 MHz Doppler probe was used in the arms and legs to assess the ABI in 43 patients with primary APS (mean (SD) age 40.2 (7.9) years) and 49 healthy subjects (aged 41.0 (11.7)) matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, smoking, and other variables, were collected at that time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A ratio of the highest blood pressure from the posterior tibial or pedal arteries of each leg to the highest blood pressure from the brachial arteries &lt;1.00 was considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal ABIs were found in 8/43 (19%) patients with primary APS and 2/49 (4%) controls (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation between abnormal ABI and traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> nor with the presence of aPL was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal ABIs are more common in primary APS than in healthy controls, possibly indicating a subclinical atherosclerotic process in these patients </plain></SENT>
