<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early and aggressive treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin, pulse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and plasmapheresis resulted in an excellent clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patient showed a concomitant presence of multiple factors that could precipitate atypical HUS, including positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, decreased level of factor H and positive anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that, along with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, autoimmune conditions or defined genetic abnormalities of complement regulatory genes, MAPS should be considered among the pathogenic mechanisms in patients with atypical HUS </plain></SENT>
