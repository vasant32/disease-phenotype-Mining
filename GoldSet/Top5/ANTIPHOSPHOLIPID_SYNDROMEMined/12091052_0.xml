<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings showed that he had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen activity was reduced (21%), but its antigenic level was rather elevated (16.4 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy of plasminogen activity and antigen levels was also found in his three daughters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation (Ala601--&gt;Thr) at exon 15 of the plasminogen gene in the patient and a heterozygous mutation in his three daughters, suggesting that the patient has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysplasminogenaemia</z:e>, which was reported as "plasminogen Tochigi." Although it still remains controversial whether both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysplasminogenaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasminogen deficiency</z:e> are relevant independent thrombotic risk factors, the combination of this deficiency and APS should be considered as a strong predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this patient </plain></SENT>
