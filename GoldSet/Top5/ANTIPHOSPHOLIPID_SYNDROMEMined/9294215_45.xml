<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that many aPLs bound to CL only after it had been oxidized (OxCL), but not to a reduced CL analogue that could not undergo oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that the neoepitopes recognized by some aPLs consist of adducts formed between breakdown products of oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and associated proteins, such as beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta2GP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Addition of human beta2GP1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53411">polylysine</z:chebi>, native <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> AI to OxCL-coated wells increased the anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) binding from APS sera that first had been diluted so that no aCL binding to OxCL could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No increase in aCL binding was observed when these proteins were added to wells coated with reduced CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of beta2GP1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53411">polylysine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> to be a "cofactor" for aCL binding to OxCL was greatly reduced when the proteins were methylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of beta2GP1 with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleyl-[1-14C]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC), but not with dipalmitoyl-[1-14C]-PC, led to formation of covalent adducts with beta2GP1 recognized by APS sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the reactive groups of OxCL, such as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> generated during the decomposition of oxidized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi>, form covalent adducts with beta2GP1 (and other proteins) and that these are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for aCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by many aPLs are adducts of oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and associated proteins, including beta2GP1, may give new insights into the pathogenic events underlying the clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
