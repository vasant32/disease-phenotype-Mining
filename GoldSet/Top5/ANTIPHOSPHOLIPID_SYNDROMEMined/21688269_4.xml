<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Murine models show that complement activation plays a pivotal role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-mediated pregnancy morbidity, but the exact pathways of complement activation and their potential role in human pregnancy are insufficiently understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the classical pathway would play a major role in inducing fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pregnant C57BL/6 mice and mice deficient in C1q and factor D were injected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse placentas were subsequently stained with an anti-C4 antibody and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG to determine the presence of classical complement activation and IgG binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings in mice were validated in 88 human placentae from 83 women (SLE and APS cases versus controls), which were immunohistochemically stained for C4d, C1q, properdin and MBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staining patterns were compared to pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In murine placentae of mice pretreated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, increased C4 deposition was observed, which was associated with adverse fetal outcome but not with IgG binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In humans, diffuse C4d staining at the feto-maternal interface was present almost exclusively in patients with SLE and/or APS (p &lt; 0.001) and was related to intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show that presence of C4d in murine and human placentae is strongly related to adverse fetal outcome in the setting of SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The excessive deposition of C4d supports the concept of severe autoantibody-mediated injury at the fetal-maternal interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest C4d as a potential biomarker of autoantibody-mediated fetal loss in SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
