<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance to activated protein C can be assessed with plasma as well as with DNA-based assays that are commercially available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acquired disorders include the development of antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-protein complexes (as would occur in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inherited and acquired abnormalities are most commonly apparent as superficial or deep venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in younger patients, most of whom have additional risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, such as use of oral contraceptives or recent trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These tests are cost effective if the results will influence patient management or will have potential value in the care of family members in situations of increased thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
