<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> is characterized by a pentad of clinical findings, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001937'>microangiopathic hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, renal abnormalities, neurologic signs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 27-year-old woman developed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in her second trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She presented with classical symptoms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> with compatible renal biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although four articles of SLE criteria (1982 ARA) were fulfilled, three of them were considered to be derived from multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> except for a positive antinuclear antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibody) with SLE-like findings suggested the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome rather than SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> has been described in patients with SLE and they can share common clinical and pathological features, the relationship between these two diseases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many theories have been proposed to explain the nature and cause of intravascular platelet aggregation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
