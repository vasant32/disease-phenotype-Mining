<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible formation of ternary complexes between β(2)GPI, antibodies and Hep in APS is thus possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate Hep-β(2)GPI interaction in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The affinity of Heps of different length, including unfractionated Hep (UFH), low-molecular weight Hep (enoxaparin) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35369">pentasaccharide</z:chebi> (fondaparinux), to human β(2)GPI was estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy, yielding dissociation constant (K(d)) values of 1.1, 24.0 and 89.4 µM, demonstrating that the longer UFH binds to β(2)GPI far more tightly than the shorter ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma and protein G-purified IgGs from eight patients with APS (i.e. five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> and three with catastrophic APS), were fractionated by affinity chromatography using a Hep (UFH)-bound column, eluted with a linear <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each chromatographic analysis, fractions were collected in the whole <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> gradient and tested by ELISA for the presence of β(2)GPI and anti-β(2)GPI IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of Hep-affinity chromatography and ELISAs concurrently indicate that either β(2)GPI and anti-β(2)GPI IgG elute from the Hep column in the same chromatographic peak, at a retention time identical to that of the purified, isolated β(2)GPI, thus suggesting that circulating immunocomplexes containing β(2)GPI are present in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
