<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was initiated to determine whether these antibodies are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>520 serum samples from 175 patients with SLE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) were tested for antibodies to purified apoA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive sera were retested for binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> incorporated into reconstructed nascent or mature <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to apoA1 were found in 32.5% of patients with SLE and 22.9% of patients with PAPS, associated with the presence of aPL (anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1, anti-beta2 GP1) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When reconstructed, nascent and mature <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> molecules were compared as antigen-containing environments, positive sera reacted best to apoA1 embedded in mature <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report confirms the high prevalence of antibodies to apoA1 in patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and suggests a high affinity of these antibodies for mature <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
