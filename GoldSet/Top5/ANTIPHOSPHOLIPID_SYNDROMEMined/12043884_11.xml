<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the syndrome is associated with characteristic autoantibodies, these tests have poor predictive value for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine whether the combined presence of two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can be associated with a high-risk subset of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-prone patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-four sera from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> clinic were tested for antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI), protein S and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a group of 29 patients for whom plasma was available, free (functional) protein S levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to beta2GPI and protein S are associated with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dual reactivity to beta2GPI and protein S correlates with increased history of thrombotic events (69% of doubly reactive patients) when compared to either type of autoantibody alone (37% of patients with only anti-beta2GPI and 38% with only anti-protein S, P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively) or neither reactivity (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 29 patients tested for free (functional, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) protein S levels, the lowest levels were found in patients with antibodies to beta2GPI and/or protein S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had below-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> free protein S levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations were not found with antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion dual autoantibodies to beta2GPI and protein S are associated with increased history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
