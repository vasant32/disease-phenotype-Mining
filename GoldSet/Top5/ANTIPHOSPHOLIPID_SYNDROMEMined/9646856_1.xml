<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), antibodies to beta 2GPI contribute to the population of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>" measured in the anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, both IgG and IgM antibodies from patients with APS bind beta 2GPI in the absence of anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> if the antigen is bound to a suitable surface, i.e., one which exposes the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The binding of IgA was studied from patients with APS, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and significantly higher binding of IgA was observed from 39 patients compared to a control group of 50 healthy individuals (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 15 out of 39 APS subjects (38 percent) exhibited binding greater than 5 standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 39 APS patients had elevated IgG anti-beta 2GPI; however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of IgG from two APS sera diminished, rather than enhanced, binding of IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-incubation with purified IgG from a subject with APS led to inhibition of IgA binding at inhibitor levels &gt; 125 micrograms IgG/well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that patients with APS have IgA anti-beta 2GPI autoantibodies and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) which are recognized by these antibodies can be presented in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or other anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
