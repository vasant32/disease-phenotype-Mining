<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The effect of low-dose aspirin (LDA) on pregnancy outcome in antiphospholipid (aPL)-positive women not fulfilling the criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) was evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 139 pregnancies of 114 aPL-positive women not fulfilling the Sydney classification criteria for definite APS (104 treated with LDA, 35 untreated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) any titer of aPL and no previous pregnancy or no pregnancy losses (defined as aPL carriers); (2) any titer of aPL and 1 or 2 pregnancy losses before the 10th gestational week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No women had previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of pregnancy loss, gestational age at delivery, and birth weight percentile were compared in the treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between clinical and laboratory characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of pregnancy loss was low in both treated and untreated groups (7.7% vs 2.9%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of pregnancy loss, gestational age at birth, or birth weight percentile in the treated and untreated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations between gestational age at birth ≤ 34th week and positivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (p = 0.025) and anti-ß2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I IgG antibodies at titers &gt; 99th (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LDA treatment does not appear to improve pregnancy outcome in low-risk women not fulfilling the criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because antibody profile seems to influence pregnancy outcome, further studies of patients stratified according to their antibody profile are warranted </plain></SENT>
