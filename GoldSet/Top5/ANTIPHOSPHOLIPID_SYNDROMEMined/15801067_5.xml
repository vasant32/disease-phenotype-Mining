<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) as well as carriers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kala-azar</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leptospirosis</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particular interest was given to the presence of clinical complications related to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 GP I antibodies were searched using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of APS were observed in 34 of the 152 patients (22.3%) with SLE and no patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> had such manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in moderate or high levels and anti-beta2 GP I were detected in 55 of 152 (36.1%) and 36 of 152 (23.6%) patients with SLE, respectively, and in 2 of 30 (6.6%) and 16 of 30 (53.3%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kala-azar</z:e>, in 9 of 39 (23%) and 6 of 34 (17.6%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leptospirosis</z:e>, and 14 of 74 (18.9%) and 8 of 70 (11.4%) cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), negative predictive value (NPV) and likelihood ratio (LR) of the anti-beta2 GP I test for the identification of the clinical manifestation of APS were, respectively, 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 24%-34%], 78% (95% CI = 73-83%), 15% (95% CI = 11-19%), 89% (95% CI = 85-93%) and 1.38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding the aCL assay, the figure was 29% (95% CI = 24-34%), 76% (95% CI = 71-81%), 14% (95% CI = 10-18%), 89% (95% CI = 86-92%) and 1.26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As the validity and performance of the anti-beta2 GP I assay were similar to the aCL in demonstrating the presence of clinical phenomena associated with APS and due to the difficulties in performing as well as the lack of standardisation of the anti-beta2 GP I test, we suggest that the test for aCL should continue to be the first one performed when the presence of APS is suspected </plain></SENT>
