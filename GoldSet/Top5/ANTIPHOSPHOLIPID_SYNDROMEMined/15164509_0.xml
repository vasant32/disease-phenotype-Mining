<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of them, 20 patients were GC untreated (group 1) while 33 ones took GC for a long time (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of 20 (45%) patients and 9 of 33 (27%) patients of group 1 and 2, respectively, had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography examined common carotid arteries (CCA), brachial arteries (BA), femoral arteries (FA) with measurement of the thickness of the intima-media complex (IMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> spectrum was examined with standard enzyme assay using kits by Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaques of carotid arteries were detected only in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CCA IMC thickness reached 0.78 +/- 0.17 and 0.75 +/- 0.16 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This thickness was significantly greater in SLE patients with APS than free of APS (0.89 +/- 0.18 and 0.87 +/- 0.18 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively; 0.72 mm on the average in both groups, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients of group 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> showed a significant increase in CCA IMC (0.84 +/- 0.18 mm) vs patients with normolipidemia (0.70 +/- 0.13 mm, p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased levels of cholesterol, LDLP cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were recorded in SLE patients of group 1 with CCA IMC &gt; 0.8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group 1 there were significant positive correlations between CCA IMC and levels of total cholesterol, LDLP cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r = 0.78, 0.76 and 0.66 respectively, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, atherosclerotic affection of the peripheral arteries in SLE is associated with long-term course of the disease, APS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and intake of GC </plain></SENT>
