<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated antibodies to factor VII/VIIa (FVII/VIIa) and five other common target antigens in 33 patients with a history of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) and 50 healthy controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that antibody to FVII/VIIa, a previously unrecognized and common antigen in APS, was present in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of antibodies to other target antigens were: anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (anti-beta 2GP1), 88%; anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (anti-CL), 76%; anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (anti-PE), 67%; anti-phosphatidylserine (anti-PS), 64%; and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (anti-PC), 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had antibodies against multiple antigens, but a few were positive for only anti-beta 2GP1 (12%) or anti-CL (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity for anti-FVII/VIIa was significantly associated with positivity for anti-PE, anti-PS and/or anti-PC (P &lt; 0.05) but not anti-beta 2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When frequencies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) versus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were compared, anti-beta 2GP1 IgG correlated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) and was significantly more prevalent than IgM, but the reverse was seen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, IgM was more prevalent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antigens, and was significantly associated with FVII/VIIa, PE and PS, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, IgG was frequently prevalent, especially in association with FVII/VIIa, beta 2GP1 and CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, FVII/VIIa is a new and common antigen in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-FVII/VIIa is often associated with anti-PE, anti-PS and anti-PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IgM class is more frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and the IgG class with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
