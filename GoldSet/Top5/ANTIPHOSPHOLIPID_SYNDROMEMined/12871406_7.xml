<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As the activity of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) may be impaired in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), 162 aPL patients were evaluated for autoantibodies to recombinant TFPI (anti-TFPI) using an optimized ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-TFPI (&gt;18 U mL(-1) for IgG and/or &gt; 15 U mL-1 for IgM) were detected in 54 patients with aPL (33.3%) and in three out of 79 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (3.8%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among aPL patients, the prevalence of positive anti-TFPI was 38.3 and 28.4% in those with or without diagnosis of definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with definite APS had a significantly greater frequency of high titer (&gt;50 U mL(-1)) anti-TFPI than aPL patients from the no definite APS group (18.5% vs. 6.2%, OR 3.7, P= 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most aPL recognized full-length TFPI, but not a truncated form of TFPI lacking the C-terminus of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolated IgGs from subjects with anti-TFPI impaired the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of TFPI on factor Xa activity in the presence, but not in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, aPL with high titer anti-TFPI limit TFPI action and are associated with the APS </plain></SENT>
