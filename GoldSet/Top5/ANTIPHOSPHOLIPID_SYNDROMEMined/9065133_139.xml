<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, single-center trial included 50 patients who were alternately assigned to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient had at least three consecutive spontaneous pregnancy losses, positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on two occasions, and a complete evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were compared by chi(2) analysis and Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Viable infants were delivered of 11 of 25 (44%) women treated with aspirin and 20 of 25 (80%) women treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the low-dose aspirin and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin groups with respect to gestational age at delivery (37.8 +/- 2.1 vs 37.2 +/- 3.4 weeks), number of cesarean sections (18% vs 20%), or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin provides a significantly better pregnancy outcome than low-dose aspirin alone does for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-associated recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
