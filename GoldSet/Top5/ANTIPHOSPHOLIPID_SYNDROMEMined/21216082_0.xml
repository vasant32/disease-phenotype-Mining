<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have observed that some cases of food <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> were followed by severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated to anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Food <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> has seldom been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aims were: 1) to test anticardiolipin antibodies in an important number of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> due to vegetal foods and their relationship with possible <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and 2) to study seed and fruit hypersensitivity in patients with previous thrombotic events associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 30 patients diagnosed of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with aCL, 52 patients who suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> due to seeds or fruits, and 120 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haematological, cardiopulmonary vascular and rheumatologic studies had been performed as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo and in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> tests with a large battery of vegetal <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> were carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of IgG aCL antibodies and specific IgE to vegetal food was done by ELISA and CAP-FEIA (Phadia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunodetection and inhibitions with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> belonging to seeds were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the patients diagnosed as having antiphospholipid primary syndrome had specific IgE against different proteins from different vegetable <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>, most of them seeds, and clearly against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> that were also recognised by the patients with food <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> but not by the control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, 28% had anticardiolipin antibodies and 17.3% <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that seed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> which cause severe food <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> might have a potential role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
