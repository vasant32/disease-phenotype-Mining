<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results and complications of ovulation induction therapy (OIT) in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 21 women followed in a single tertiary-referral French center who underwent 114 OIT cycles with or without in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVFET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before OIT, SLE was present in 6 women, APS in 3, SLE-related APS in 3, and discoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight women had no identified disease and underwent 36 cycles of OIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis (SLE, n = 3; primary APS, n = 5) was made after OIT complication: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (n = 5), SLE flare (n = 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five women with known disease intentionally concealed their history from their gynecologists and underwent 34 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four cycles were planned in 11 women, in 3 of them after complications of prior OIT performed without particular therapy and monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen pregnancies occurred, which ended in 9 live births, 4 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and 5 embryonic losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy rate was higher with gonadotropin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) (25% of cycles) than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3752">clomiphene</z:chebi> (4% of cycles, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the gynecologists did not know the underlying disease, three-quarters of pregnancies induced by OIT with IVFET ended in embryonic losses or fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 6 of 7 pregnancies induced by planned OIT with IVFET ended in live births (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phlebothromboses were observed only with gonadotropin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SLE flare rate was higher with gonadotropin and/or GnRHa (27% of cycle) than with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3752">clomiphene</z:chebi> (6%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also was higher (30%) when the gynecologists did not know the underlying disease than in the planned procedures (10%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The OIT may precipitate SLE or APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A careful review of the patient's history and appropriate laboratory tests should be undertaken before OIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3752">Clomiphene</z:chebi> complications are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When gonadotropins are prescribed, preventive anti-inflammatory therapy should be considered in women with SLE, in addition to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and/or anti-aggregant therapy in patients with asymptomatic anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies or prior thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
