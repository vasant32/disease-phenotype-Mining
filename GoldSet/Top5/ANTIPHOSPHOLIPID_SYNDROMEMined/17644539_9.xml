<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of anti-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> platelet factor 4 antibodies (anti-HPF4) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera and clinical data were obtained from the Hospital for Special Surgery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmune Disease</z:hpo> Registry for 78 aPL-positive and 91 aPL-negative SLE patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls were 90 blood donors of comparable age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera were assayed for anti-HPF4, IgG/IgM <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APhL), and IgG/IgM anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 antibodies (anti-beta 2GP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> release assays (SRAs) were performed for subjects with positive anti-HPF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive anti-HPF4 was seen in 9% of aPL-positive SLE patients, 4% of aPL-negative SLE patients and 1% of controls (p = 0.026, aPL-positive SLE vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of 12 subjects with positive anti-HPF4 had reactive SRAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SLE patients, anti-HPF4 significantly correlated with IgM APhL, IgM anti-beta2GP1, and inversely with complement C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In immunoabsorption experiments, there was partial cross-reactivity of IgM anti-HPF4 with IgM APhL, but not with IgM anti-beta 2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with positive anti-HPF4 had increased odds of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS; odds ratio (OR) 4.5, p = 0.019), and APS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 6.1, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate linear regression analyses, APS and IgM APhL were independently associated with anti-HPF4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HPF4 is detectable in SLE patients with and without aPL in the absence of HIT, and is most prevalent in aPL-positive SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this SLE cohort, anti-HPF4 correlates with IgM APhL, IgM anti-beta 2GP1 and inversely with C4, and is associated with manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
