<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> among young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> ranges from 14% to 21%, and this condition implies specific therapeutic attitudes as new thrombotic events may occur, according to some authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken with 25 patients aged &gt; or = 65 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> that were admitted to our institution during one year who were compared with control patients with similar risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were measured in the first 24 hours since the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> symptoms and three months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The follow-up ranged from three months to one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients, ACA positivity in the two measurements was higher (12%) than that observed in the control group (5%) (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACA positivity on two occasions was not a risk factor for new thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ACA positivity is higher among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients (measured early and at three months) than among the general population although the presence of such antibodies does not increase the risk for new post-infarction thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
