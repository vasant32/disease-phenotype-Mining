<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first episode had responded dramatically to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The manifestations of the second episode did not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> or IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He showed persistently raised levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary conditions like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, exposure to drugs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, which are known to be associated with the raised titers of these antibodies were ruled out clinically and by investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> is a rare event in childhood and reports of its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibody</z:hpo> Syndrome (APLAS) are scanty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The etiological role for these antibodies remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, once the diagnosis is established, it may be prudent to treat the condition with agents and procedures to bring about a decrease in their titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term therapy to prevent thromboembolic complications of APLAS may also be instituted </plain></SENT>
