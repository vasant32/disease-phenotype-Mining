<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insufficient data are available about the evolution, but 7 patients died in the year following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had fluctuations in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> detection: 2 initially <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> positive became negative, 5 initially negative became positive and 1 patient was alternatively positive, negative and positive without steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, as expected, <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> occur in a variety of clinical disorders </plain></SENT>
