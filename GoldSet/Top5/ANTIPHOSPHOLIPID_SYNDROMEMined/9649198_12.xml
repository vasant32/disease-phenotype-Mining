<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) hamper the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of the protein C system, but the mechanism is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that anticardiolipin antibodies (not anti-protein C autoantibodies) can bind protein C via beta2-GPI, which bears their binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, in a fashion dependent on negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the binding of IgG from aPL to protein C in the presence of beta2-GPI by ELISA (anti-'protein C' antibody ELISA), and compared their binding with those obtained in the absence of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the anti-'protein C' antibody ELISA system, 47% of 78 aPL+ patients had a positive titre in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) and beta2-GPI, but binding was not found in the absence of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly significant correlations were found between the titre of anti-'protein C' antibody in the presence of beta2-GPI and that of anti-beta2-GPI antibody (r = 0.802, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further analysed the interaction between protein C, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, beta2-GPI and human aCL MoAbs established from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a first set of experiments, the binding of beta2-GPI to protein C and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependency were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beta2-GPI bound to protein C in the presence of CL or phosphatidylserine, but not in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a second group of experiments, the binding of three human monoclonal aCL recognizing the cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of beta2-GPI (virtually anti-beta2-GPI antibodies) was evaluated in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three human monoclonal aCL bound to protein C in the presence of CL and beta2-GPI, whereas they did not in the absence of either beta2-GPI or CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that protein C could be a target of aCL by making a complex with CL and beta2-GPI, leading to protein C dysfunction </plain></SENT>
