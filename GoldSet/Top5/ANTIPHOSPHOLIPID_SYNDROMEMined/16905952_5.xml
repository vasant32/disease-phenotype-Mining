<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This manifests as acquired activated protein C (APC) resistance in the absence of factor V Leiden and has been proposed as a putative mechanism for the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a Russell's viper venom test, performed with and without activation of endogenous protein C, which is sensitive to aPA-associated APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were reported as the endogenous APC ratio (EAPCr); the ratio of the two clotting times normalized against pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with aPA, anticardiolipin and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, including 34 with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or pregnancy morbidity; a control group of aPA-negative patients; and 26 healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EAPCr (mean, SD) was significantly higher in APS patients (1.94, 0.58) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (0.98, 0.12) or controls (1.14, 0.19; P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated EAPCr (&gt; 1.22) occurred in 91% of aPA-positive patients, predominantly due to resistance to APC (87%) rather than prolonged basal clotting times alone (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation was observed between the EAPCr value and dilute Russell's viper venom time (rs = 0.44, P = 0.003), IgG anticardiolipin (rs = 0.54, P = 0.002), protein S (r = -0.46, P = 0.01) and activated partial thromboplastin time-based APC resistance (r = -0.61, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between EAPCr and protein C concentration, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2GPI) or IgM anticardiolipin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Purified aPA IgG caused a dose-dependent increase in APC resistance when added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that aPA-associated acquired APC resistance is a common feature of APS and may be independent of anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
