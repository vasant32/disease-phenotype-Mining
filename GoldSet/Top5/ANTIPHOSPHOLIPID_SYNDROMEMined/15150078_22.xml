<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) plays a role in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> system and in placental development, we hypothesized that anti-EPCR autoantibodies may be involved in clinical manifestations of APS and in fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG anti-EPCR autoantibodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 43 patients with APS and 43 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR levels were higher in APS patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one of the IgM anti-EPCR autoantibodies inhibited the generation of activated protein C on endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since markedly high anti-EPCR levels were found in women with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 87 patients with a first episode of unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were subsequently analyzed and their anti-EPCR levels were compared with 87 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that anti-EPCR autoantibodies constitute an independent risk factor for a first fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> episode: the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for anti-EPCR autoantibodies above the 95th percentile were 23.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-266.3) for IgM and 6.8 (95% CI, 1.2-38.4) for IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR autoantibodies can be detected in APS patients and are independent risk factors for fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
