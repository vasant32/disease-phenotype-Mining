<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To estimate the frequency of relapses of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications during moderately intensive therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with and without aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients diagnosed as having the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients (n = 49) received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> alone as an antithrombotic drug; Group 2 patients (n = 33) had a combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> plus aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of therapy was evaluated from the number and rate of recurrences of thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and its safety was assessed from the frequency and number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genetic variants of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> CYP2C9 were determined in 52 of the 82 patients; mutations in the gene for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28371">vitamin K epoxide</z:chebi> reductase complex 1 (VCORC1) were revealed in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up, antithrombotic therapy was ineffective in 18.4 and 36.6% of the Groups 1 and 2 patients, respectively (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of poor outcomes (thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) was 7 and 14.8 cases per 100 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first six months of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy proved to be most risky for thrombotic events to occur--this period was responsible for 37% of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic complications of antithrombotic therapy developed in 46.9 and 60.6% of Groups 1 and 2 patients, respectively (p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were observed more frequently in the combination (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin) therapy group than in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> monotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> gene variants (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) were present in 38.5% of the patients; VCORC1 gene mutations were observed in 27.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of nasal and gingival <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> was increased in patients with CYP2C9*3 and homozygous VCORC1 gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Moderately intensive <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy (international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0) could generally reduce the frequency of recurrent thrombotic events by at least 2-fold as compared with that before <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> alone or in combination with aspirin in APS was found to be similar; and its safety was higher during monotherapy therefore it is undesirable to combine <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with antiaggregants in real clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The determination of CYP2C9 and VCORC1 genotypes in patients with APS before <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use allows excessive hypocoagulation and related <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> to be avoided </plain></SENT>
