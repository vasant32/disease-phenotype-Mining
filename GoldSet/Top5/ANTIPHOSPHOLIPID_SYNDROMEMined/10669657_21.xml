<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APLAs bind to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> directly or indirectly via a cofactor such as beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> target of APLA is not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we observed that APLAs in vitro can bind lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The internal membranes of late endosomes are enriched in this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current study was undertaken to determine to what extent binding of APLA to LBPA is correlated with binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and to beta(2)GPI and to determine whether patient antibodies interact with late endosomes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and thus modify the intracellular trafficking of proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of patient immunoglobulin G (n=37) to LBPA was correlated significantly with binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although LBPA binding was correlated to a lesser extent with beta(2)GPI binding, we observed that beta(2)GPI binds with high affinity to LBPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies showed that late endosomes of HUVECs contain LBPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient but not control antibodies recognized late endosomes, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-rich mitochondria, even when we used antibodies that were immunopurified on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incubation of HUVECs with patient plasma samples immunoreactive toward LBPA resulted in an accumulation of the antibodies in late endosomes and led to a redistribution of the insulinlike growth factor 2/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17369">mannose-6-phosphate</z:chebi> receptor from the Golgi apparatus to late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that LBPA is an important <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> target of APLA in HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These antibodies are internalized by the cells and accumulate in late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By modifying the intracellular trafficking of proteins, APLA could contribute to several of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms leading to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
