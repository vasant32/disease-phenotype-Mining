<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The significance of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (ACLA) in patients with a range of autoimmune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infective disorders</z:e> was investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although lower levels of IgG and IgM ACLA were present in 77 of 400 patients' sera (19%), high antibody levels were found in less than 5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These latter patients belonged to three clinical categories: patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> (CTD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> or biological false positive serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An assay was developed to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity in serum: significant LA activity was found in the CTD patients alone (in 6 of 15 tested) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these had high titre ACLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were present in these six patients but also in three additional CTD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LA results and high levels of ACLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two CTD patients with APS features, the high ACLA were of IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results stress the importance of measuring both ACLA and LA in an investigation of the APS: a high positive ACLA supports the diagnosis of APS, particularly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, whilst a high positive ACLA in association with LA activity is specific for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
