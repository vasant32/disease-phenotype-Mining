<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 5 randomly selected monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> originating from a single patient suffering from this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, only 1 induced fetal losses when passively injected into pregnant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its antiphospholipid activity was dependent on annexin A5, and its variable regions contained mainly 3 replacement mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of these mutations in the pathogenicity of the antibody, they were in vitro reverted to the germ line configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting "germ line" antibody reacted with multiple self-antigens and only partially lost its reactivity against PLs, but it was no more dependent on annexin A5 and, more importantly, was no more pathogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates that the in vivo antigen-driven maturation process of natural autoreactive B cells can be responsible for pathogenicity </plain></SENT>
