<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the prevalence of antithrombin, protein C, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, G1691A factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin (FII) gene variant, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in patients over 75 years who were referred to us for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing and who presented with unprovoked recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> at unusual site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight patients, mean aged 86 years, were included in the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No deficiency in natural coagulation inhibitors was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (12.8%) and 6 patients (7.7%) were found heterozygous carriers of the factor V Leiden and of the G20210A FII mutation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was a double heterozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed along with those obtained in cohorts of elderly patients or in cohorts of younger patients presenting with idiopathic venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, either recurrent or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results trend to confirm the recently published French recommendations regarding inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening in the elderly: in patients aged 60 years or older, testing should be limited given the weak impact of this finding on the anticoagulation management </plain></SENT>
