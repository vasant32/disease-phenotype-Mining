<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PLa were determined as antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CLa) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine (PSa) and as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) tested by dilute Russell's Viper Venom time and by the Textarin/Ecarin ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APC-response was studied by a clotting (aPTT-based) and by an amidolytic (factor IXa-X-based) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reduced response to APC (APC-resistance) was found in 49% of 65 PLa-positive and in 13% of 90 PLa-negative samples (chi 2 = 23.9; p &lt; 0.5 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was more common in the samples with LA, as compared to CLa+PSa positive (58% vs. 30%, not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of the mutation causing Arg506<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32668">-Gln</z:chebi> substitution in coagulation factor V was investigated in 84 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of the mutation in APC-resistant patients with CLa+PSa or with LA in one of the two assays was similar to those without PLa (84% and 100%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of APC resistance, the occurrence of the mutation was similar in the samples with and without PLa (14% vs. 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Samples with LA, determined by both tests used, comprised a special group where the frequency of the mutation in the APC resistant samples was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter samples, the pathogenic mechanism of APC resistance may be connected with the influence on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes </plain></SENT>
