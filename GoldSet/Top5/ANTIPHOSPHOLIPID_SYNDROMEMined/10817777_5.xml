<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic and environmental conditions are among the factors attributed to the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether these factors determine the prevalence of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of patients were tested for the presence of IgG, IgM and IgA anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylinositol (aPI), antiphosphatidylglycerol (aPG) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS) antibodies: (i) patients with primary APS (PAPS); (ii) patients with SLE and secondary APS; and (iii) patients with SLE without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives and spouses of patients with SLE/APS were also tested for circulating aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG aPL were particularly prevalent in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG aPI and aCL were more prevalent in patients with PAPS than the IgM equivalents (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, none of the patients with PAPS had IgA aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher number of relatives of patients with SLE/APS possessed IgG aPL than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for aPG (P &lt; 0.03), the prevalence of these antibodies in the relatives was not significantly different from patients with SLE/APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relatives also had significantly higher prevalence of IgG aPI, aPS and aCL antibodies than IgM aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the prevalence of IgG aPL in the spouses was no different than in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors, shared by patients and their relatives, seem to have some effect on the prevalence of aPL in the subjects studied, while environmental factors shared by spouses appear to have no influence </plain></SENT>
