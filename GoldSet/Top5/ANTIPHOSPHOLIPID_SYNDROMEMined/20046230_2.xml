<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore compared single antiplatelet therapy and a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy for secondary prevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with APS.The subjects were 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>, 13 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 7 with SLE-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of APS was based on the 2006 Sydney criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg) or a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy (target INR: 2.0-3.0; mean 2.4+/-0.3) for the secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> according to a double-blind protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in age, gender, NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale on admission, mRS at discharge, or rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
