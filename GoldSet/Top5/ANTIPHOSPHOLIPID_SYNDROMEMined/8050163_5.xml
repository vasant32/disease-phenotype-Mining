<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antibodies recognizing anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> have been described in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that some of these antibodies may recognize a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-binding protein (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> H) rather than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar possibility is conceivable for other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-binding proteins that are targets of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we have addressed whether this might be the case for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi>, a set of highly cationic and widely distributed proteins that react in a well known autoantibody system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that: (i) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> bind to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine) with high avidity, but not to zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>); (ii) monoclonal and polyclonal antihistone antibodies recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>; (iii) the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> to serum samples containing antihistone antibodies often enhances their anticardiolipin reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have found that antihistone-producing hybridomas derived from MRL-lpr mice may show anticardiolipin activity due to the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> in the cell culture supernatants with the resultant formation of immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results suggest a potential role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> in the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> activity detected in sera containing antihistone antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> interactions should be taken into account when evaluating the pathogenic effects of antihistone antibodies or other autoantibodies reacting with nuclear components (e.g. nucleosomes) containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
