<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The importance of vascular risk factors (VRF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion (RVO) has not been conclusively established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relevance of VRF, prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, and ultrasonography findings in the supra-aortic trunks in patients with RVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients diagnosed of RVO referred to an Internal Medicine clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical, laboratory (including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> panel) and ultrasonographic variables were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 98 patients (56 men, 42 women) mean age 66 years, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> were the most prevalent VRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 24% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> and atherosclerotic plaques were detected in the supra-aortic trunks in 48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RVO was peripheral in 69 and central in 29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was detected in 13% and it was acquired in 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> was observed in 50% of subjects aged &lt;50 years and in 67% of those without VRF (P=.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent received antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven were on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, although this did not prevent the development of RVO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation treatment was initiated in 4 cases, this being maintained indefinitely in the three patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RVO, it may be recommendable to control classical VRF and measure serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> should be ruled out and that a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> should only be considered in subjects aged &lt;50 years or without VRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is the treatment of choice to reduce the overall vascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation should only be considered in those patients with high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
