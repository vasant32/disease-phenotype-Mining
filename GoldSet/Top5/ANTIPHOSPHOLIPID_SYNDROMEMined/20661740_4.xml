<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed a link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the features of serologic response to EBV in SLE patients and whether this response differs from those of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) patients as well as healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 198 consecutive SLE patients have been tested to detect IgG antibodies to EA/D, EBNA-1, VCA P18 and for comparison, cytomegalovirus (CMV) using commercially available ELISA kits (Trinity Biotech, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six SSc patients and 38 PAPS patients were enrolled as diseased control groups and sixty-five individuals as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more SLE (54%, P = 0.001, OR 5.77, 95% CI 2.8-11.6), SSc (41.3%, P = 0.005, OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.2) and PAPS sera (36.8%, P = 0.023, OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.14-7.22) reacted against EA/D than healthy controls (16.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of anti-EA/D-positive SLE patients was significantly higher, and their disease duration was longer compared to anti-EA/D-negative SLE patients (41 ± 14 vs. 33.8 ± 10.8 years, P &lt; 0.001 and 100 ± 73 vs. 71 ± 62 months, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SLE patients, EA/D reactivity was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> and the presence of any anti-ENA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it did not reach a statistical significance, anti-EBNA-1 reactivity was slightly lower in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of anti-CMV Ig G positivity was found significantly higher in SLE patients (100%) when compared to patients with SSc (95.7%), PAPS (94.7%) and healthy controls (95.4%) (P = 0.035, P = 0.025 and P = 0.015 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results support the proposed link between EBV and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The finding that SSc and PAPS patients also have increased frequency of anti-EA/D response has revealed that this immune interaction may not be unique to patients with SLE, and there may be a common mechanism involving EBV in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
