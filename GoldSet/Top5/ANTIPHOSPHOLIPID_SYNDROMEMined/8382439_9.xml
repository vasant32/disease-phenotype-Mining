<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These three women had had two pulmonary embolies related to pregnancy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> containing pills, 13 miscarriages and only one liveborn after pre-eclamptic pregnancy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of IgG-anticardiolipin antibody titer was observed after repetitive high dose iv-immunoglobulin (1 g/kg body-weight) infusions </plain></SENT>
