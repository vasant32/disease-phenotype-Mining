<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to vary among different SLE populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess SDI score, pattern and factors related to damage in Brazilian SLE outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SDI was obtained in 105 patients with a median age of 41 (5-95%, 19-61.7) years and a median SLE duration of 127 (17.6-345.9) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had a median SDI of 2 (0-8) and 81.9% had some damage (SDI &gt; 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Damage was associated with a higher number of ACR criteria for SLE in multivariate analysis (OR = 2.32, 95%CI = 1.23-4.37, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, damage was very frequent in Brazilian SLE patients, mainly due to skin involvement, compared to other SLE populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of APS was the major independent contributor to the development of severe damage </plain></SENT>
