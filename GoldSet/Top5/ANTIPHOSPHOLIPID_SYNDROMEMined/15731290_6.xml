<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical characteristics, drug treatment, and 1652 data points for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2GPI) were examined in 204 aPL positive patients; 81 of these met the Sapporo criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and 123 were asymptomatic bearers of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 87% of initially positive LA results, 88% of initially negative to low positive aCL results, 75% of initially moderate to high positive aCL results, 96% of initially negative to low positive anti-beta2GPI results, and 76% of initially moderate to high positive anti-beta2GPI results subsequently remained in the same range regardless of the laboratory performing the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aspirin, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, and hydroxychloroquine use did not differ among patients whose aCL titres significantly decreased or increased or remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On same day specimens, the consistency of aCL results among suppliers ranged from 64% to 88% and the correlation ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement was moderate for aCL IgG and aCL IgM; however, for aCL IgA agreement was marginal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: aPL results remained stable for at least three quarters of subsequent tests, regardless of the laboratory performing the test; the small amount of variation that occurred did not appear to be caused by aspirin, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, or hydroxychloroquine use </plain></SENT>
