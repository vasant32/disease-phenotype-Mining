<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that aPL are thrombogenic in vivo, but the mechanism(s) involved are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated that aPL antibodies activate endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro, as determined by up-regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules: E-selectin (E-sel); intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of these study were to determine the effects of aPL antibodies on the expression of E-selectin on ECs, on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of monocytes to ECs and to study the role of E-selectin on aPL antibodies enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and activation of ECs in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the surface expression of E-selectin on HUVEC by ELISA was increased 400-fold when treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and 421-fold when treated with aPL antibodies during 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APL antibodies also induced activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APL antibodies increased significantly the number of adhering leukocytes to ECs in vivo in C57BL/6 J mice when compared to IgG-NHS treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was abrogated in E-selectin-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size was significantly increased in C57BL/6 J mice treated with aPL antibodies when compared to mice treated with IgG-NHS </plain></SENT>
