<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the concept of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome has been proposed in patients with SLE and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, the immunological mechanism is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the crossreactivity between anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody and anti-ssDNA antibodies has been discussed in relation to this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the specificity such as the avidity and the crossreactivity of anti-ssDNA antibodies was examined to find a clue to clarify the question why <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody positive patients do not have any specific clinical features, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The avidity of IgG anti-ssDNA antibodies was examined by salt elution studies in solid phase ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The avidity of anti-ssDNA antibodies tended to be lower in 10 patients with specific features than in other 10 patients without those features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crossreactivity of affinity purified IgG anti-ssDNA antibodies was investigated by competitive ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Purified anti-ssDNA antibodies from 4 patients without specific features were slightly inhibited by negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine, whereas purified anti-ssDNA antibodies from 2 patients with specific features, who were considered to have anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, were little inhibited by these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above results suggest that the specificity of anti-ssDNA antibodies appears, at least partly, in different manners whether specific features are present or absent in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti-ssDNA antibodies and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies may form separate groups of antibodies in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
