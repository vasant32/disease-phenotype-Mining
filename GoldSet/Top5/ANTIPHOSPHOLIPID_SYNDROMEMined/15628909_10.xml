<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish whether antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins such as beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), prothrombin (PT), and annexin V (Anx V) constitute a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), independently of the presence of the classic anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, and whether their determination together with that of aCL would help to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of aPL tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The prevalence of various antibodies directed toward <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (CL and other anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> [APL]) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins (beta(2)GPI, PT, and Anx V) was determined by immunoenzymatic methods in 311 serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients with aCL-positive primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (pAPS); 89 patients with SLE, 23 of whom had thrombotic complications (SLE/APS) and 66 of whom had no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and 77 women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss comprised our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty healthy subjects matched for age and sex were studied as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or IgM aAPL, anti-beta(2)GPI, anti-PT, and IgG anti-Anx V antibodies were detected in 25 (100%), 20 (80%), 15 (60%), and 6 (24%), respectively, of the 25 aCL-positive pAPS patients; IgG and/or IgM aCL, aAPL, anti-beta(2)GPI, anti-PT, and IgG anti-Anx V antibodies were detected in 33 (37%), 42 (47%), 31 (35%), 40 (45%), and 12 (13%) of the 89 SLE patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 SLE patients who proved to be aCL negative, anti-beta(2)GPI was present in 3 patients (5%), anti-PT in 13 (23%) patients, and anti-Anx V in 5 (9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subset of 23 SLE/APS patients, IgG anti-PT prevalence was higher than that of the other autoantibodies (87% vs 70% aCL, 66% aAPL, 57% anti-beta(2)GPI, and 4% anti-Anx V), and in 26% of cases, IgG anti-PT was the only antibody present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-PT had a slightly lower specificity than aCL (46% vs 49%); however, the occurrence of both antibodies brought the specificity to 92.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE patients was associated with the presence of IgG anti-PT antibody (odds ratio [OR] 15.3, P &lt; .001, vs 6.5 aCL, 3.5 aAPL, 3.4 anti-beta(2)GPI, 0.2 anti-Anx V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one of the 77 women with recurrent pregnancy loss were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antibodies investigated; the prevalence of IgG and/or IgM aCL, aAPL, anti-beta(2)GPI, anti-PT, and IgG anti-Anx V antibodies was 6% (5), 12% (9), 6% (5), 16% (12), and 17% (13), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 67 aCL-negative women, none had anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies, 7 (11%) were anti-PT positive, and 13 (19%) were anti-Anx V positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of 26 recurrent pregnancy loss patients who had at least one antibody, anti-Anx V was present in 50% of cases (in 42% as the sole antibody) and was the only antibody significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that it is useful to measure anti-PT antibodies in addition to the more widely used aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies in the prognostic evaluation of SLE patients for the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the results also confirm that anti-Anx V antibodies may play an important role in recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
