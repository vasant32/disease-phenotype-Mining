<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> often present with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> which may ultimately lead to recurrent arterial and venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients has been proposed as one of the potential mechanisms promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report two consecutive patients with localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, one suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and another presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, who experienced dramatic exacerbation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APAS) within 4 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first patient who had also received one course of adjuvant chemotherapy, major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were paralleled by the development of ulcerative livedoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, constituting the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> with secondary APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, progressive thrombotic occlusion of the superior and inferior vena cava was associated with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, and disabling soft tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although not fulfilling the classic criteria of "catastrophic" APAS, the clinical features were life threatening and appeared to be refractory to oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398359" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Trousseau's syndrome</z:e> was unlikely due to missing evidence of gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides a suggested treatment strategy comprising high doses of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, potential pathogenic mechanisms are discussed in consideration of a recently proposed "thrombotic storm," which may cause multiple thromboses after an initial provocation in patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
