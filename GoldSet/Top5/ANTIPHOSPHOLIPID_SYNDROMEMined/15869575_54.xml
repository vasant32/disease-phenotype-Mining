<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retrospective studies show that only high-intensity oral anticoagulation [target international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;3.0] is effective but a recent randomized clinical trial comparing high (INR range 3.0-4.0) vs. moderate (INR 2.0-3.0) intensities of anticoagulation failed to confirm this assumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in which 109 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were given either high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (INR range 3.0-4.5, 54 patients) or standard antithrombotic therapy (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, INR range 2.0-3.0 in 52 patients or aspirin alone, 100 mg day(-1) in three patients) to determine whether intensive anticoagulation is superior to standard treatment in preventing symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> without increasing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 109 patients enrolled in the trial were followed up for a median time of 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean INR during follow-up was 3.2 (SD 0.6) in the high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group and 2.5 (SD 0.3) (P &lt; 0.0001) in the conventional treatment patients given <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>Recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> was observed in six of 54 patients (11.1%) assigned to receive high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and in three of 55 patients (5.5%) assigned to receive conventional treatment [hazard ratio for the high intensity group, 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-7.89] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 15 patients (two major) (27.8%) assigned to receive high-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and eight (three major) (14.6%) assigned to receive conventional treatment (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI 0.92-5.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was not superior to standard treatment in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with APS and was associated with an increased rate of minor hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
