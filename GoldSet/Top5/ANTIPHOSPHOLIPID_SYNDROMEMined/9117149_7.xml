<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients [44 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL)], 21 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), eight asymptomatic individuals with aPL and 60 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen SLE patients (14 with aPL and two without aPL) and six with primary APS had a beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between a beta 2GPI and aPL (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In SLE, a significant correlation was found between previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and a beta 2GPI or a beta 2GPI + aPL, but not between fetal losses and a beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a beta 2GPI may be useful in the study of APS </plain></SENT>
