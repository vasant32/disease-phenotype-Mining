<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fifth domain of the beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) protein, a putative PL-binding site, may play a critical role in APS pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify associations between beta2GPI mutations and both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and their associated clinical manifestations in a pediatric and adolescent cohort and to search for novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of beta2GPI was performed in 58 youths with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or aPL, to identify known polymorphisms at amino acids 247 and 306 as well as novel mutations in exon 7 of the beta2GPI gene, and their association with aPL-associated clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate an association between substitution of Val for Leu at AA247 (L247V) of beta2GPI and both the development of aPL (P = 0.05) and aPL-associated clinical manifestations (P = 0.03) among pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio associated with risk of aPL-associated clinical manifestations for the homozygous VV polymorphism was 5.5 (CI 1.3-23, P = 0.03) for the overall cohort, and 4.75 (CI 0.66-55.49, P = 0.06) after adjusting for ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was not significant after stratifying for SLE versus non-SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Association between the VV genotype at amino acid 247 of beta2GPI and clinical disease supports a genetic cause for APS among children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither novel exon 7 beta2GPI mutations or the previously described C306G polymorphism was identified in this pediatric cohort </plain></SENT>
