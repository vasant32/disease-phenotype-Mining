<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> are observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and other thrombotic disorders, but the importance of circulating <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of these diseases is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numbers of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> are usually determined by flowcytometry (FCM), but easier and reproducible <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> assay systems are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To develop a better ELISA for <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi>, we used antibodies against the platelet antigens anti-GPIb (NNKY5-5), anti-GPIIb/IIIa (NNKY2-11, anti-CD41), anti-GPIX (KMP-9), and anti-CD9 (NNKY1-19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> were detected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> combinations of these antibodies, but the ELISA having the highest and most specific absorbance was obtained with a combination of KMP-9 (capture antibody) and NNKY5-5 (detecting antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> in blood samples were measured by ELISA and FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ELISA correlated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> quantitated by FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> ELISA plates during incubation, nonspecific binding of platelets was eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> was not increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> was elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Activated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> were absorbed to 0.8 microm filter, but circulating <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> were not absorbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that activated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> are likely to adhere to leukocytes or endothelial cells at the activation site and that the circulating form of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> are likely to be a residue of activated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To detect only the activated form of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMPs</z:chebi>, a new ELISA needs to be developed, and it will likely use a combination of antibodies that detect platelet activation markers such as P-selectin (CD62P) or activated GPIIb/IIIa </plain></SENT>
