<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The monocyte-endothelial cell interaction has been suggested to play a key role at the site of vascular injury during <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tested the effect of anticardiolipin Abs (aCL) on the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) in HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that monoclonal aCL as well as IgG fractions from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS-IgG) could induce the production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of IgG aCL to induce <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 production could be abrogated by preabsorption with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous addition of either monoclonal aCL or APS-IgG with IL-1beta resulted in synergistic increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 production, whereas the addition of control IgG lacking aCL activity did not alter IL-1beta-induced levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 mRNA expression was also up-regulated when HUVEC were incubated with either APS-IgG or monoclonal aCL, and down-regulated by the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that serum levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in 76 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> patients correlated well with the titers of IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results indicate that aCL could promote endothelial cell-monocyte cross-talk by enhancing the endothelial production of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, thereby shifting the hemostatic balance toward the prothrombotic state of APS </plain></SENT>
