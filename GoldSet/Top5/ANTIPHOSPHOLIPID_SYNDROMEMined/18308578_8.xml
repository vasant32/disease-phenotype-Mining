<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the role of thrombotic and inflammatory perivascular factors and standard APS therapies for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Groups of mice (n=10 per group) were immunized once with beta(2)-GPI (eAPS) or adjuvant (controls) and treated daily from 1 month after immunization with either sham injections, aspirin (1.2 mg/kg) or enoxaparin (1 mg/kg) for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and brain levels of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>) were then measured by ELISA and thrombin inhibitors by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Behavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> was assessed by the staircase test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eAPS mice had higher levels of aPL than adjuvant immunized controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory markers were found to be twofold higher and intrinsic brain thrombin inhibitors 50% lower in eAPS brains compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>aPL titers were unaffected by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both aspirin and enoxaparin normalized brain concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi> and TNF-alpha and elevated thrombin inhibitors, the latter effect being more pronounced for enoxaparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increased activity and rearing exploratory behavior in eAPS (138.6+/-13.6 and 141.9+/-13.9% of controls, respectively) were attenuated significantly more by treatment with enoxaparin (91.5+/-12.3 and 95.0+/-9.8%) than by aspirin (167.0+/-18.4 and 114.7+/-13.1%, p&lt;0.01, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these results demonstrate that eAPS is associated with significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001847'>brain inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that are well treated with both standard therapies for human APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin attenuates behavior better than aspirin possibly by reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or stabilization of the blood brain barrier, suggesting an advantage for similar drugs in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> APS </plain></SENT>
