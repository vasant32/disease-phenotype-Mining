<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the antiphospholipid profile of 103 lupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive patients to investigate whether laboratory patterns emerged for their association with arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin, anti-&lt;beta&gt;2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and antiprothrombin antibodies were combined with coagulation tests in different patterns, which included from 2 to 5 laboratory variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 22 out of 180 available associations reached significance: 14 with any type of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases, anticardiolipin antibodies&gt;40 units were present in the laboratory patterns that reached significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-&lt;beta&gt;2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies were present in 11 significant patterns, and antiprothrombin antibodies in seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing the number of variables of the laboratory patterns did not increase the odds ratio (OR) towards <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this analysis confirmed that the presence of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies at medium to high titres, either alone or in various combinations with other tests, is clinically useful to establish the patients' risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is less clear </plain></SENT>
