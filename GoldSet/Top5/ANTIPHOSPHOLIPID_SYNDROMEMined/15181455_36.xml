<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) relocates to the cell surface, where it reacts with autoantibodies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analysed the intracellular distribution of CL and its metabolites during the early phase of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> signalling triggered by Fas stimulation in U937 cells and mouse liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found a redistribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> CL to the cell surface by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry revealed that CL and its metabolites relocated from mitochondria to other intracellular organelles during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, with a conversion into non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, cytosolic Bid relocated to the light membranes comprised in fraction P100, including the plasma membrane and associated vesicular systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A direct Bid-CL interaction was demonstrated by the observation that CL and monolysoCL coimmunoprecipitated with Bid especially after Fas stimulation, suggesting a dynamic interaction of the protein with CL and its metabolites </plain></SENT>
