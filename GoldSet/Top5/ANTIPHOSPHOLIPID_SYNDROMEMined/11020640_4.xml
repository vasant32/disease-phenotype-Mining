<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the significant side effects associated with the drugs currently used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, we sought to further evaluate the efficacy of carbamazepine in children with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was prospective and included 10 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> (eight females and two males; age range = 7-16 years) referred to our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic between 1995 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine had rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome that later evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement was evident within 2-14 days of initiation of low doses of carbamazepine (4-10 mg/kg daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma drug levels were 2.8-8.2 microg/mL (therapeutic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> range = 8-12 microg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> disappeared within 2-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of treatment was 1-15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was observed in three patients who received a second trial of carbamazepine with a good response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that carbamazepine may serve as a first-line treatment for rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
