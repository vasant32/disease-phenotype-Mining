<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another 14% had either one aPL-related manifestation but high titers of the antibody or two manifestations and low aPL titers (probable aPLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One fourth of the patients had no manifestations but high titers, one manifestation and low titers, or two or more manifestations and negative aPL titers ("doubtful" aPLS); the other half were considered negative for aPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with high-titer aPL, the number of aPL-related manifestations was influenced by disease duration and number of pregnancies, indicating potential mobility of category with time or with risk of recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with two or more manifestations but variable aPL levels differed in immunosuppressive treatment and in the number of times they had been tested, indicating potential mobility of category with lower treatment and/or further aPL testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with definite aPLS had increased risk of cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 11 of 52 SLE patients with definite aPLS the initial manifestation was related to aPL, and in 16 it concurred with an unrelated one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two patients fulfilled criteria for aPLS before having other evidence of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that aPLS occurring within SLE is part of the disease rather than an associated condition and propose the use of definite and probable classification categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These criteria, with appropriate follow-up and clinical and serological exclusion clauses for potential primary conditions, could also be applied to primary aPLS </plain></SENT>
