<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 81 PAPS patients were compared with 81 blood-donor healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTPN22 SNP (R620W) genotyping was performed by using a polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between control subjects and PAPS patients for the PTPN22*R620W genotypes (P = 0.214) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found according to either the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or the clinical manifestations associated to PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that this functional PTPN22*R620W polymorphism is not associated to PAPS; it seems not to be a risk factor in our Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of the PTPN22 SNP on clinical manifestations and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in APS warrants further investigations </plain></SENT>
