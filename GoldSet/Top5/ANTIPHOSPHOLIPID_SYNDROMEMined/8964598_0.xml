<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the causal role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of pregnancy failure we studied the effects of immunization with monoclonal anti-DNA antibody (designated 16/6 Id; no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> reactivity) and anticardiolipin monoclonal antibody (designated 2C4C2; binds DNA as well) on the outcome of allogeneic pregnancies in BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mating of BALB/c females 4 weeks after active immunization with the 16/6 Id, anti-DNA monoclonal antibody resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy outcome, similar to control mouse groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to that, immunization with the 2C4C2 anticardiolipin antibodies resulted in severe gestational failure with low pregnancy rate, low numbers of fetuses and high rates of resorptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fertility index of those mice was extremely low as compared to the 16/6 Id-immunized mice or the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a correlation was shown between the presence of anticardiolipin antibody levels in the sera of the mice at the time of gestation and the pregnancy fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2C4C2-immunized mice which produced high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies demonstrated severe pregnancy failure, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gestations were observed in the 16/6 Id primed or the control mouse groups that did not produce measurable amounts of the latter antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our studies demonstrate that anticardiolipin but not the 16/6 Id anti-DNA antibodies can induce severe gestational impairment </plain></SENT>
