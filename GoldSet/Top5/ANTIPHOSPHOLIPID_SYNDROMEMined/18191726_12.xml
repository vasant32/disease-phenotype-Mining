<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, SDF-1, and RANTES polymorphisms as susceptibility markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in a group of Mexican patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1-2518, SDF-1 G801A, and RANTES-28 polymorphisms were determined in 242 patients with SLE and 220 ethnically matched healthy controls by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differences between patients and healthy controls were evaluated by chi(2), Fisher's exact test, and Woolf method for odds ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A moderately increased frequency of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1-2518 A allele (p = 0.033, pC = NS) and AA genotype (p = 0.017, pC = NS) existed in SLE patients compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a relationship between polymorphisms and some clinical and laboratory characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> demonstrated different distribution of SDF-1 G801A genotype frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, anti-dsDNA, and antiphospholipid autoantibodies demonstrated different <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1-2518 genotype distribution compared with patients without these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 polymorphism is moderately associated with the genetic susceptibility to SLE in Mexican individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms could be related to specific clinical and laboratory characteristics in these patients </plain></SENT>
