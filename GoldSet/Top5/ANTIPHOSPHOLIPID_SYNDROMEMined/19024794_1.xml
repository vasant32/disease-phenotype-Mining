<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the past decades, many studies were published considering cosmo-terrestrial influences on different sites of human homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to summarize some of those studies in the field of cardiovascular medicine, concentrating on environmental physical activity--Solar (SA), Geomagnetic (GMA), and conversely, Cosmic Ray (CRA)--links with atherothrombosis, the basic mechanism of most vascular catastrophes in modern society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A preview of a number of comparative studies between clinical events-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>), laboratory data of coagulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (daily, monthly), with parameters of SA, GMA, CRA, and closely linked to CRA, high energy space proton flux at high energies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory data were from studies in Lithuania and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physical data were from space-science institutions in the USA and Russia (until 1990-USSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICS: Student's t-test and Pearson correlation coefficients and their probabilities were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant relation was found between the level of GMA (I-IV) and blood coagulation parameters, (platelet count and aggregation, fibrinogen, INR [ratio of patient's prothrombin time to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>], <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers--serum C-reactive protein (CRP), elements of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from ischemic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, SCD, outpatients <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The monthly occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (total and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes) was connected with CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monthly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> (mostly ischemic) were correlated with CRA, and both events were closely connected with atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three basic components of atherothrombosis-blood coagulation, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, atheroma disruption are connected with environmental physical activity--CRA is predominant in plaque disruption, cellular damage, electrical instability, GMA in the activation of coagulation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
