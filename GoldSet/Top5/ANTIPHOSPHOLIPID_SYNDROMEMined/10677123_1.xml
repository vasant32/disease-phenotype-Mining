<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 is a cofactor necessary for the binding of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-beta2GP1) predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), and whether the measurement of anti-beta2GP1 will be more useful than aCL alone in the evaluation of coronary risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Persons who had undergone coronary angiography were invited to participate, and risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL and anti-beta2GP1 were measured and fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic score (AS) was defined as the number of diseased vessels (0, 1, 2, 3), (&gt;50% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ethics Committee approval was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical comparison used the Student's t test and Chi-squared test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects (63 male) with age range 38-81 years (mean 66.0) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 31 subjects with AS=0, 27 with AS=1, 22 with AS=2, and 17 with AS=3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The three subjects with positive aCL <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had CAD, as did three of the four subjects with positive anti-beta2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients with CAD, there was an equal incidence (4.5%, three/66) of aCL and anti-beta2GP1, and an incidence of either aCL or anti-beta2GP1 of 7.6% (five/66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared to the group with AS=0, those with AS=1, 2 or 3 comprised a higher mean age (p=0.001) however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of other coronary risk factors between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the proportions of patients with either aCL or anti-beta2GP1 in the group with AS=1, 2, or 3, compared to the group with AS=0 (5/66 c.f. 1/31, chi2=0.146, p&gt;0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study has not supported an association between anti-beta2GP1 and CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The measurement of anti-beta2GP1 (or aCL) in the investigation of premature CAD is not justified on the basis of our results </plain></SENT>
