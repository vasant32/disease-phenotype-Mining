<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that aPL may affect endothelial cell (EC) function and/or induce their activation, transforming their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> surface into procoagulant, thus predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that aPL may affect EC cell function and/or induce their activation, transforming their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> surface into procoagulant, thus predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study proposes to test the hypotheses that some IgG anticardiolipins (IgG aCL) with thrombogenic properties in mice, exert their effects through activation of endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied seven patient-derived monoclonal aCL for their thrombogenic properties in an in vivo pinch-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, and their functional activities in activating EC by analyzing in vivo leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to endothelium in microcirculation in venules in exposed murine cremaster muscle and in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression in cultured EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The binding of the monoclonal aCL to EC was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the previous identified thrombogenic IS2, four of the five new more IgG monoclonal aCL (from two patients) were found to be thrombogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these five thrombogenic aCL, three caused more in vivo leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to EC in microcirculation, as compared to that induced by the H2 control human monoclonal IgG, and enhanced expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (particularly VCAM-1) on cultured EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that about 2/3 patient-derived IgG monoclonal aCL are thrombogenic and suggest that some thrombogenic IgG aCL exert their effects through activating EC </plain></SENT>
