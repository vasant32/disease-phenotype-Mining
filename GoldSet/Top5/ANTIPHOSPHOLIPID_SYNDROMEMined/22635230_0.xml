<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of serum C3 and C4 complement component levels in relation to pregnancy outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 47 pregnancies associated with APS was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy outcome was analyzed in terms of: fetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> (â‰¤34 gestational weeks), fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (IUGR), birth weight &lt;2500 g and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Week at delivery, neonatal birth weight and neonatal birth weight percentile were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypocomplementemia, positivity for anti-dsDNA and triple positivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) were related to pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three pregnancies ended in live births with a fetal loss rate of 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> and birth weight &lt;2500 g were associated with hypocomplementemia (p = 0.019, p = 0.0002, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower neonatal birth weight, lower neonatal birth weight percentile and lower week at delivery were associated with hypocomplementemia (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.0003, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively) and with triple aPL positivity (p = 0.008, p = 0.014, p = 0.03 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A poor pregnancy outcome was confirmed among primary APS (PAPS) pregnancies with hypocomplementemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed that hypocomplementemia was an independent predictor of lower neonatal birth weight (p = 0.0001) and lower week at delivery (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypocomplementemia could be considered a novel prognostic factor for pregnancy outcome in APS patients </plain></SENT>
