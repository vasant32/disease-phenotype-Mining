<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse rheumatological manifestations, organ damage and <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp> in a large cohort of patients (n = 45) with homozygous C2 deficiency (C2D) and long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and were supplemented with a mailed questionnaire for assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Organ damage was evaluated using the Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SLICC/ACR DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Causes for disability pensions were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies were determined with established methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with rheumatological diseases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE, n = 12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> (n = 5) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Judging from annual SLICC/ACR DI, C2D patients with SLE run a similar risk of development of severe disease as other patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increased rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was observed not explained by Framingham-related risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disability pensions were mainly related to rheumatological disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies in C2D with SLE and of anti-SS-A was 25% while anti-RNP was found in 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient showed antibodies to dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Formation of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL) appeared to be increased in C2D despite the absence of an anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of antibodies to the collagen-like region of C1q (C1qCLR) was also remarkably high and was not related to rheumatological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Severity of SLE in C2D is similar to that of SLE in other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conventional risk factors do not explain the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in C2D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of aCL and anti-C1qCLR indicates mechanisms through which impaired complement function promotes formation of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
