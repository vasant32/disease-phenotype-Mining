<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Some studies have previously suggested the involvement of antibodies directed against CD36 (anti-CD36) in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of anti-CD36 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and its relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-CD36 were tested using an indirect MAIPA assay in 62 patients with autoimmune aPL but without SLE; there were 38 with and 24 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> served as an aPL(-) control group and 58 healthy subjects as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 15 of 62 aPL patients (24.2%) but only 1 of 58 (1.7%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls had anti-CD36 (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the prevalence of anti-CD36 was significantly higher in aPL patients with (26.3%, p &lt; 0.0005) or without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20.8%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD36 were significantly more frequent in aPL patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> aPL(-) subjects (26.3% vs 0%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-CD36 seems to be more frequent in aPL patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> than in those with a single episode (36.8% vs 15.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-CD36 is highly prevalent in patients with autoimmune aPL with a trend to being more frequent in patients with recurrent episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
