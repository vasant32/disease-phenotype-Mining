<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SS has also been found in patients diagnosed with definite MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Chinese lady developed multiple relapsing neurological events involving the brain and spinal cord from the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> relapses showed increased T2 signals and spinal cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She later developed positive anti-nuclear antibody and anti-Ro autoantibody followed by sicca symptoms, confirming the diagnosis of SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0007024'>pseudobulbar palsy</z:hpo> shortly after SS was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS-like disease and autoantibodies should be carefully evaluated for other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> as the treatment and prognosis differ from MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, sicca symptoms should be sought as they often go unnoticed by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is especially important in Orientals in whom MS is relatively uncommon </plain></SENT>
