<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or occur in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of this so-called primary APS is the presence of circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal involvement in primary APS is caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within the renal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, nonthrombotic glomerulonephritic renal lesions have been described in primary APS as a new histological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We here report a patient with primary APS in whom both lesion types were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old Caucasian man with no significant past medical history presented to our nephrology unit with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urinalysis showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> exceeding 400 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The autoantibody panel (p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, c- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, anti-nucleus, anti-DS-DNA) was negative except for anticardiolipin antibodies, which tested positive in two different samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic workup included a kidney biopsy that revealed thrombotic lesions compatible with primary APS and a typical pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000097'>focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The kidney is a major target in APS but the exact mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> has been poorly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of kidney biopsy is a fundamental diagnostic tool in this setting, with possible implications also from a prognostic and therapeutic viewpoint </plain></SENT>
