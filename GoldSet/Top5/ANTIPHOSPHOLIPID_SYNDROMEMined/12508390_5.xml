<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate mechanisms responsible for increased thrombotic activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had reported that anticardiolipin/beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (aCL/beta2-GPI) complexes induce platelet overactivity resulting in excessive production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presumably this occurs by decreased platelet cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (cAMP) activity and results in <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We stimulated platelet intracellular cAMP generation with known cAMP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cAMP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi>) and measured aCL/beta2-GPI induced platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated human platelets were prelabeled with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> and then challenged with aCL/beta2-GPI in the presence or absence of cAMP-activating substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi> labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> was quantified by thin layer chromatography and radioactive scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a marked decrease in aCL/beta2-GPI induced platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production by the cAMP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in a dose dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the usefulness of cAMP <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in some patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
