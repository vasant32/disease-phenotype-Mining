<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin is now accepted as one of the target antigens recognised by antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether anti-prothrombin antibodies are pathogenic in vivo and if so, the possible mechanism(s) involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined the pathogenic effects of the IS6 monoclonal anti-prothrombin antibody isolated from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IS6 antibody was purified from hybridoma supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenic potentials were studied in an in vivo model of induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of tissue factor (TF) and E-selectin on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was determined by cyto-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcription of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was determined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size increased significantly when treated with IS6 compared with control-treated mice (5388 +/- 1035 microm2 vs. 2845 +/- 1711 microm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IS6 induced significant expression of TF and E-selectin on HUVEC, when compared with control preparation (3.1- and 5.1-fold increase compared with the control-treated cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcription showed a 2.5-fold increase of IS6-treated cells over the value obtained with control-treated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that IS6 monoclonal anti-prothrombin antibody promotes <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and this is associated with TF and E-selectin expression </plain></SENT>
