<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite "positive" tests for HIT antibodies, the low pretest probability for HIT and the known propensity of patients with APS to yield false-positive HIT antibody results suggests that the patient did not have a true diagnosis of HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the early administration of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and the choice of argatroban for parenteral anticoagulation when monitoring was hindered by a prolonged baseline aPTT likely play a key factor in the progression of UE DVT to VLG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ironically, the problems of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> monitoring posed by the prolonged baseline aPTT likely contributed to the subsequent overanticoagulation and fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With benefit of hindsight, avoiding the temptation to test for HIT in a low pretest probability situation, and treatment with either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> using anti-factor Xa monitoring or with non-aPTT-monitored therapy such as LMWH or fondaparinux would likely have resulted in a more favorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
