<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Couples with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> make several visits to specialized clinics for investigations before treatment is offered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, 'the interval' between receipt of referral and advice to try for a pregnancy is often lengthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of a 'one-stop' clinic on 'the interval', throughput and the outcome from this clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The processes for investigation, management and outcomes of 189 couples seen in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent Miscarriage</z:e> Clinic (RMC) and their records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The one-stop clinic reduced the interval and number of visits by 36% (206.6 to 130.4 days, P &lt; 0.001) and by 60% (2.5 to 1, P &lt; 0.002) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and frequency of aetiological factors were similar in those with two and three or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> (41% versus 45%, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The commonest aetiological factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> (14%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cause was identified in 54% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy and live birth rates were best in the idiopathic group (75%), those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> (64%) and autoimmune antibodies (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older couples had the worse pregnancy rates and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A one-stop clinic significantly shortens 'the interval' between referral and initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Investigations should be initiated in women after two consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
