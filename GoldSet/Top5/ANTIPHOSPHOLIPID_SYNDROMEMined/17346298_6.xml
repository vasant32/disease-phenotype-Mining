<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess its serum levels in children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and to elucidate its correlation with clinical features, laboratory parameters, and the overall disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study comprised 25 children and adolescents with SLE and 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was evaluated by SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations included complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine analysis, 24-h total urinary protein, assay of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, ANA, anti-DNA, complement component C3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and VEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of VEGF were significantly increased in SLE patients (579.5 +/- 184.7 pg/ml) when compared with controls (113.2 +/- 30.8 pg/ml) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF serum levels were significantly increased in patients having renal involvement and neurologic symptoms than those who did not have them (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of VEGF were higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and skin symptoms than those without, but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, they were similar in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VEGF serum levels were not correlated to age; inversely correlated to platelet count, serum C3 level; and positively correlated to ESR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SLEDAI score was positively correlated to VEGF serum level (r = 0.86, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VEGF may be relevant to SLE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Its concentration seems to be a marker of SLE activity, which could help in disease monitoring and planning of treatment </plain></SENT>
