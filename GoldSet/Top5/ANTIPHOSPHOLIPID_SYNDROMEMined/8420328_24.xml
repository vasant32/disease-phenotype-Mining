<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated for 8 hours in a medium containing 20% serum obtained either from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (n = 11) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar incubations were performed with immunoglobulin G fractions from either patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (n = 3) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell tissue factor expression was measured with a tissue factor-specific chromogenic substrate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed with a two-tailed t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean endothelial cell tissue factor expression induced by antiphospholipid sera was significantly greater than the controls (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin experiments indicated that the factor(s) responsible for the induction of tissue factor expression resides in the immunoglobulin G fraction of the sera (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cell tissue factor expression is induced by antiphospholipid sera, with activity residing at least in part in the immunoglobulin fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The induction of tissue factor by antiphospholipid sera may play a role in the thrombotic tendency observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
