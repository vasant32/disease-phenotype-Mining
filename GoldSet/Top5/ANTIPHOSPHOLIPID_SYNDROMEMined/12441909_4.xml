<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a high potential is also seen in non-APS patients, the mechanism is substantially unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the effect of abetaGPI on PC and antithrombin-III (AT-III) activity in non-APS patients with non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (NCCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 111 NCCI patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were free of APS manifestation, and their anticardiolipin antibody and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> tests were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 14.4% patients found to have an abnormal increase of blood abetaGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PC, AT-III, albumin, aminotransferases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time did not differ between our patients and controls, or patients with or without increased abetaGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a marked decrease of the PC/AT-III ratio was found in patients with increased abetaGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlation between PC and AT-III activity was highly significant in patients with an increase of abetaGPI (P = 0.001), only marginal in controls (P = 0.042), and was insignificant in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> abetaGPI (P = 0.277) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abetaGPI did not correlate to PC or AT-III activity in either patients or controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that high PC/AT-III coupling may relate to NCCI in non-APS patients associated with an increase of abetaGPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This coupling effect seems not to be caused by abetaGPI directly </plain></SENT>
