<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical manifestations (cardiac involvement and APS characteristics), operative and early postoperative courses, and long-term followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients fulfilled the Sapporo criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify those variables associated with adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1981 and 2008, 33 valvular replacements were carried out in 32 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD age at the time of surgery was 43.09 ± 14.08 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary APS was present in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median followup time after surgery was 33.5 months (range 0-192 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve was the most frequently replaced (22 of 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mechanical valve replacement was performed in 23 patients (71.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 12.5% (1 cardiogenic shock, 1 septic shock, 1 following renal transplantation, and 1 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients experienced 20 complications (8 major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 5 thrombotic events, 2 valvular deteriorations, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>third-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, 1 cardiac tamponade, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the patients had an uneventful outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality were high in APS patients undergoing valve replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most complications were related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation must be carefully monitored to prevent hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
