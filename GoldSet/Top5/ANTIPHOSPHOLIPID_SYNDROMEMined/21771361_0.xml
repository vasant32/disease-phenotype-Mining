<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three of them were using low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for the prevention of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first two women were admitted because of foetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first patient, either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> or exacerbation of APS was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A caesarean section was performed due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">foetal distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's condition deteriorated further postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple infarctions in liver and placenta were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second patient suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopaenia</z:e>, disturbances in hepatic function and epigastric pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CAPS was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The condition improved after treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, but because of a poor foetal prognosis, delivery was induced and a lifeless son was born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The third woman was admitted due to <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> developed and she was administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo> developed, indicating CAPS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mortality is high, but seems to diminish with treatment by immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In pregnancy, clinical signs of CAPS are similar to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Since the treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> is different from CAPS, a correct diagnosis is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Because of the rarity of this condition in combination with high rates of perinatal and maternal mortality, care for pregnant patients with APS should be centralised in academic centres and close cooperation between obstetricians and internal medicine is necessary </plain></SENT>
