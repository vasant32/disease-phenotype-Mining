<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate if there are any distinct clinical, laboratory or serologic features due to the association of the two diseases that can influence the follow up of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors proved the association of these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> in 56 patients, and these patients' clinical, laboratory and immunoserologic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> and 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> were used as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> alone, in the cases of the association of the diseases, rheumatoid factor was present less frequently, Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B and DNA antibodies were present more frequently, such as antiphospholipid autoantibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> were detected more often and the patients were younger than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, affection of the lung, kidney, skin, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and serous membranes are more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> differs in being older, having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>, Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B and DNA more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Definitive clinical, laboratory and serological features make the difference between the association of the two diseases and the diseases observed alone </plain></SENT>
