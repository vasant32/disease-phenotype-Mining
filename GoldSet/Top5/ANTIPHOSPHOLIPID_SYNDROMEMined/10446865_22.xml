<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequencies at which either a valine or leucine occurs at position 247 in the beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) gene of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals of the Caucasian, African American, and Asian ethnic groups and to compare these data with those in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), with and without anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The DNA segment containing the position-247 polymorphism was amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction, and the polymorphism was detected by restriction endonuclease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 370 healthy controls of different racial backgrounds were analyzed, and the results were compared with those from 149 APS patients (66 primary; 83 secondary) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When significant differences were detected, pairwise comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test with a Bonferroni adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Allele and genotype expression was significantly different (P &lt; 0.0001 for both) among the 3 races, with the V allele and the VV genotype occurring most often among Caucasians, less among African Americans, and least among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the V allele and the VV genotype were found more frequently among Asian APS patients than among controls (P = 0.0028 and P = 0.0023, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were seen in comparisons of the Caucasian or the African American patients with appropriate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in allele and genotype frequencies seen in the Asian APS patients were restricted to the anti-beta2GPI-positive patients (P = 0.0018 and P = 0.0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In Asian patients with APS, expression of a V at position 247, especially in the homozygous state, is significantly associated with the presence of anti-beta2GPI antibodies and, therefore, can be viewed as a major risk factor in this ethnic group (odds ratio 9.19 and 16.33, respectively) </plain></SENT>
