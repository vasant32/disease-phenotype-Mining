<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to define how to take those patients in charge on a short-, mid- and long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2008, five patients (four males and one female), mean age 47, were taken in charge in our service for spontaneous adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> those patients had been treated with Synacthène for a mid-sciatic pain for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We associated a clinical, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and radiologic staging to treat those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients underwent a watchful waiting, only one patient needed surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001624" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenal tumor</z:e> was ever found during the mean two years follow-up (one to four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered of the condition of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Spontaneous adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> are a most uncommon pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical attitude has thus to be defined clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient must be under close clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biological and morphological parameters have to be often repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001624" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenal tumor</z:e> has to be excluded by the evaluation, as that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> could be secreting or could not be secreting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> must also be excluded </plain></SENT>
