<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It could be the reason for many organs and tissues impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in eyes that occurr in SLE are not frequent, but can lead to severe impairment of sight including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the work was to asses the frequency of eye changes among patients with SLE and SLE with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another aim was to asses the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 75 patients enrolled with SLE, 26 of them ha APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of patients had a comprehensive ophthalmological and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover biochemica analysis including <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and serological markers of APS and SLE were performe RESULTS: Thirty-six patients complained of ophthalmologic disturbances (48%), with "<z:mp ids='MP_0001337'>dry eyes</z:mp>" being the most common symptom (20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> was detected in 17 patients (22.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>Conjunctivitis</z:hpo> was found in 8 patients (10.67%), corneal involvement in 31 (41.3%), and sclera changes in 40 patients (53.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in retina were found in 15 (20%) of patients, the most frequent were sub-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the region of yellow spot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in yellow spot were found in 8 patients; in 2 of them it was associated with dry degenerative changes, in 6 patients exudates with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular changes including their lumen diameter were found in 33 patients (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients there were changes in optical nerve disc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Schirmer's test was pathological in 43 patients (57.3%), but in only 4 patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the group of SLE patients intraocular pressure was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies IgG class (aCL IgG) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-beta2, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies (anti-beta2GPI) was associated with conjunctive involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The presence of aCL IgM and anti-beta2GPI was associated with less frequent symptoms of eye dryness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found the following significant factors of the occurrence of eye involvement in our series of SLE patients: high activity of disease (conjuctiva, iris, uvea, retina, spot, vessels and optical nerve disc involvement), late diagnosis of SLE (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and conjuctive involvement), arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo>, cornea involvement, vessels involvement), age (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo>, cornea involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolism disorders</z:e> (changes in optical nerve disc) and presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi> antibodies (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
