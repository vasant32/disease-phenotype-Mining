<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known on the actual diagnostic and therapeutic management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> and the impact of introducing guidelines on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate any changes in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> among Dutch gynaecologists after the introduction of the Dutch guideline '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent Miscarriage</z:e>' in 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> practices for obstetrics and gynaecology in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data concerned definition, diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with a similar study conducted before the introduction of the guideline and with the recommendations in the guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding gestational age, only 3% of the respondents used the definition as advised in the guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the introduction of the guideline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> factors were tested more frequently, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were prescribed more frequently and more respondents reported to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000130'>uterine malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapies not described in the guideline, e.g. donor insemination and oocyte donation, were still applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The adherence to the Dutch guideline '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent Miscarriage</z:e>' was rather poor, presumably due to guideline-related as well as physician-related barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Too many diagnostic tests and ineffective therapeutic interventions were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the importance of appropriate implementation and revision </plain></SENT>
