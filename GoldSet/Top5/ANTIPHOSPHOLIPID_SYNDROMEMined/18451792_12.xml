<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishment of this diagnosis has enabled effective management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> or recurrent pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The test was first established in 1983 as a radioimmunoassay and soon thereafter converted into ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been numerous efforts to standardize the aCL test, but precise reproducible measurement of aCL levels is difficult and the use of semiquantitative measurements (high, medium and low) is recommended as this is probably sufficient for clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using validated ELISAs for measuring aCL Abs offers greater reproducibility, would reduce interlaboratory variations and limit discrepancies in results between different laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article details a procedure that takes approximately 2 h and summarizes the information available on the aCL ELISA test </plain></SENT>
