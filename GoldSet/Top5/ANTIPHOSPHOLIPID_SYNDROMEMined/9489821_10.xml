<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five plasma samples with LAC were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 samples were from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>: 12 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and 10 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were compared with 13 patients with drug induced LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid (aPL) activity was tested by inhibition of LAC activity in a modified coagulation assay using the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>: egg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE), 20% phosphatidylserine/80% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PS/PC), and 15% PS/65%PC/20%PE mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the autoimmune group, 95% were positive for reactivity to PE, 68% for PS/PC, 68% for PS/PC/PE, and 77% aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the drug induced group, 69% were positive for reactivity to PE, but only 23% for PS/PC, 46% PS/PC/PE, and 23% aCL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the autoimmune patient group, 64% had thrombotic episodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which had anti-PE activity, and 64% had associated anti-PS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No drug induced patient had episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autoimmune induced LAC may contain a broader range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> specificities than those from drug induced patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data thus identify another potential reason why patients with drug induced LAC appear to be at less risk of developing APS than those with autoimmune LAC </plain></SENT>
