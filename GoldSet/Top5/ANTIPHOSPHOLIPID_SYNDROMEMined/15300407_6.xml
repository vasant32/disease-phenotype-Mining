<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of the syndrome remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> and the production of type 1 [interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2] and type 2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines by CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets in 13 patients with untreated primary APS (PAPS) and in 32 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The production of cytokines was determined in T cells after a 5-h culture with or without mitogenic stimulation using a flow cytometric method of intracellular cytokine staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six of the patients these studies were repeated 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In PAPS patients we found a reduced percentage of circulating CD4+CD45RA+ and an increased percentage and absolute number of CD8+HLA-DR+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A type 1 response was observed in the patients' unstimulated cells, indicated by an increase in IFN-gamma-producing CD8+, IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells, and a decrease in IL-4-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in the patients at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in vivo stimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PAPS patients exhibiting a type 1 polarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes of cellular immunity may contribute to the pathogenesis of the clinical manifestations of the syndrome and might be proven to be useful targets for therapeutic interventions in the future </plain></SENT>
