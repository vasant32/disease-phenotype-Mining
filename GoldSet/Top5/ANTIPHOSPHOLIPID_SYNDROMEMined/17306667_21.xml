<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies that use a murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> have demonstrated a critical role for complement activation that leads to fetal and placental injury in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the placentas of patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> to demonstrate a similar association with tissue injury in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Immunohistochemical analyses with the use of antibodies to the complement products C4d, C3b, and C5b-9 were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of placentas from 47 patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> and 23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found evidence of increased complement deposition in the trophoblast cytoplasm (C4d and C3b), trophoblastic cell and basement membrane (C4d), and extravillous trophoblasts (C4d) of patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi>, compared with control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a correlation between placental pathologic features and complement deposition (C4d) in the trophoblastic cytoplasm, cell membrane, and basement membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with murine studies that implicate complement as a critical factor in the fetal tissue injury observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
