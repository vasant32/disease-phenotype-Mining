<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation enrolled 138 patients: 103 with APS, including 47 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) + APS and 56 with primary APS (PAPS), 15 with SLE without APS, 20 with idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (IT), a control group (30 apparently healthy individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> at various sites was recorded in 91 (88%) of the 103 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed both the presence of thrombotic events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups and the number of cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> type 1 antibodies, were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To diagnose a genotype in patients by the code encoding for PAI-1, DNA isolated from peripheral blood by standard methods was used and further investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 91 patients with APS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 27 (30%) had the 4G/4G genotype, which corresponded to homozygous mutation in the PAI-1 gene, 50 (55%) had the 4G/5G genotype (heterozygous mutation), and 14 (15%) had the 5G/5G (a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PAI-1 4G/5G genotype was present in 22 (70%) of 31 patients with SLE + APS and lower limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> versus 17 (470%) of 36 patients with PAPS (odds ratio (OR) 2.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89 to 8.59; p = 0.08) and in 9 (90%) of 10 patients with SLE + APS and pulmonary artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> versus 8 (40%) of 20 patients with PAPS (OR 13,5; 95% CI, 1.23 to 344.98; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> per 100 person-years was higher in the PAI-1 4G/4G and 4G/5G groups: 35.4 and 28.1 cases per 100 person-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thromboses were least often in the group of patients with the PAI-1 5G/5G genotype (18.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the PAI-1 5G/5G genotype in patients with APS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was significantly lower than in those with SLE without APS or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 4G/5G polymorphism in APS in the presence of SLE was associated with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo> whereas in PAPS there was no relationship between the PAI-1 genotype, a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and its localization </plain></SENT>
