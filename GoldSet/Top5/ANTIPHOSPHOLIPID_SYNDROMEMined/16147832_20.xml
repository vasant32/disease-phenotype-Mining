<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of complement has been proposed as an absolute requirement for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, pregnancy is characterized by a generalized activation of the innate immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether or not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy is associated with complement activation in the maternal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a) were determined in the plasma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant (20-42 wks; n=134) and non-pregnant women (n=40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These complement split products (C3a, C4a and C5a) were measured using specific immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) The median plasma concentrations of C3a, C4a and C5a were significantly higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women than in non-pregnant women (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.001); 2) the concentration of C3a, C4a and C5a did not change with gestational age (p&gt;0.05); and 3) the median plasma concentration of C3a had a positive correlation with the plasma C4a and C5a concentrations (r=0.36, p&lt;0.001 and r=0.35, p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human pregnancy is associated with evidence of complement activation, as determined by higher concentrations of the anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a and C5a in the maternal circulation; and 2) we propose that physiologic activation of the complement system during pregnancy is a compensatory mechanism aimed at protecting the host against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
