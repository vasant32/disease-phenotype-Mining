<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two women who were PAPS patients, aged 28-60 y, with mild neuropsychiatric manifestations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI findings were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain HMPAO SPECT was performed to detect brain abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, serum anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HMPAO SPECT revealed hypoperfusion lesions in 16 of 22 (73%) PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cortex and cerebellum were the most and the least commonly involved areas, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 22 (82%) and 14 of 22 (64%) patients had positive ACA and positive LA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACA and LA results were related to HMPAO SPECT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HMPAO SPECT is a sensitive tool for detecting brain abnormalities in PAPS patients with only mild neuropsychiatric manifestations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI findings </plain></SENT>
