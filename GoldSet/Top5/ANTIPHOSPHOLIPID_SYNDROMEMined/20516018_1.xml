<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> has been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylserine (PS) is normally sequestered in the inner leaflet of cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Externalization of PS during cell activation is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and has a central role in promoting blood coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the underlying pathogenic status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in SLE by analyzing PLSCR1 expression on monocytes from patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with SLE were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS/SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma D-dimer levels were measured as a marker of fibrin turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cDNA encoding human PLSCR1 was cloned from the total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extract from monocytes, and independent clones were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in CD14+ cells was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PS exposure on CD14+ cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated D-dimer levels were found in plasma from SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three splice variants of PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and levels of full-length PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were significantly increased in SLE compared to healthy controls (2.9 +/- 1.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.4, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Flow-cytometry analysis showed relative enhancement of PS exposure in the surface of CD14+ cells in SLE patients compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Novel PLSCR1 splice variants were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Monocytes in SLE patients had enhanced PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, as well as increased fibrin turnover and cell-surface PS exposure, indicating that PLSCR1 may, in part, contribute to the prothrombotic tendency in SLE </plain></SENT>
