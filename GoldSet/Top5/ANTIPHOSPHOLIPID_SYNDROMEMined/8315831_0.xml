<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS plasma or IgG fraction induced the activation of platelet aggregation, ATP release, and calcium mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These effects were thought to be related to the enhancement of the direct binding of IgG fraction on platelet surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study of coagulation system, although APS IgG inhibited factor X activation by the neutralization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, a result indicating thrombotic state in APS could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APS plasma inhibited the prostacyclin synthesis in cultured endothelial cells, and the prostacyclin stability in APS plasma was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These activating effect on platelets or inhibitory effect on prostacyclin of APS plasma or IgG fraction was thought to be one of the factors causing thrombotic state in APS </plain></SENT>
