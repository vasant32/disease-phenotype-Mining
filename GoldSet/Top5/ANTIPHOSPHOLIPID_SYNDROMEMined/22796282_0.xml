<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In solid assays, sera from patients with APS usually react to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) and PL cofactors such as β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding to neutral PL such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) is less common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PE is one of the main <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> components of the biological membranes, being mostly located in the inner leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 1989 we reported the first case of primary APS whereby a LA was accompanied not by an anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), but by an antibody to PE (aPE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we update the literature concerning the presence of aPE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and obstetric morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also discuss aPE as the sole antibody detected in many of these clinical circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An eventual link of aPE antibodies with failure of in vitro fertilization is also considered as well as uncommon clinical associations of aPE that are also discussed </plain></SENT>
