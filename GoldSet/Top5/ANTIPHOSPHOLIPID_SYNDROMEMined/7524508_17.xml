<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of short-term, maximum-tolerated-dose and long-term, optimum-dose iloprost treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with SSc and 2 with APS who had failed to respond to oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> were enrolled in a 32-week, open, prospective trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Short-term infusion of maximum-tolerated doses and continuous infusion of optimum doses of iloprost were carried out following baseline cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Catheterization was repeated at 2 and 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 patients completed the study and continued therapy for an average of 82 weeks (range 58-103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> infusion of maximum tolerated doses significantly ameliorated the cardiac index (0.92 liters/minute/m2; P &lt; 0.01), pulmonary artery O2 saturation (10.6%; P &lt; 0.05), and pulmonary resistance (-6.7 units; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of continuous infusion of optimum doses, there was improvement in pulmonary resistance (&gt; or = 16%) and pulmonary artery O2 saturation (&gt; 30%) in the 2 patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2 and 32 weeks, the 3 SSc patients showed variable hemodynamic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association functional class and exercise tolerance improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was 1 episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e>, and 1 patient died after 72 weeks of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous iloprost infusion may improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> associated with SSc and primary APS </plain></SENT>
