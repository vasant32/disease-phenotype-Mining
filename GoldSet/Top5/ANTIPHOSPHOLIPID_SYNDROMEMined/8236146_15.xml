<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms for these predispositions remain undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have enriched immunoglobulin fractions from two patient plasmas to obtain antibodies with LA activity but no ACA, or conversely, with ACA positivity but no LA, in order to investigate in vitro characteristics which might explain a thrombotic propensity. beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI), the plasma cofactor required for ACA binding to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, has previously been shown to inhibit prothrombinase generation in the presence of activated platelets (8) </plain></SENT>
