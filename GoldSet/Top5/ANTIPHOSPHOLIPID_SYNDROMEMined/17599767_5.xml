<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated in vitro expression and mutagenesis of the human IgG1 monoclonal antibody B3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate, using this expression system, the importance of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> at position 53 (R53) in B3 V(H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: R53 was altered, by site-directed mutagenesis, to serine, asparagine, or lysine, to create 3 expressed variants of V(H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the germline sequence of the V(H)3-23 gene (from which B3 V(H) is derived) was expressed either with or without arginine at position 53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 5 new heavy chains, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> B3 V(H), were expressed with 4 different light chains, and the resulting antibodies were assessed for their ability to bind to nucleosomes, alpha-actinin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, ovalbumin, beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), and the N-terminal domain of beta(2)GPI (domain I), using direct binding assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of R53 was essential but not sufficient for binding to dsDNA and nucleosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the presence of R53 reduced binding to alpha-actinin, ovalbumin, beta(2)GPI, and domain I of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination B3 (R53S) V(H)/B3 V(L) bound human, but not bovine, beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The fact that the R53S substitution significantly alters binding of B3 to different clinically relevant antigens, but that the alteration is in opposite directions depending on the antigen, implies that this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> plays a critical role in the affinity maturation of antibody B3 </plain></SENT>
