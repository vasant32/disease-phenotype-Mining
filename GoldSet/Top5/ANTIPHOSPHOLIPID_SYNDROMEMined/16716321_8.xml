<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Matched-pair study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic research institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECT(S): Women with a history of IRM, defined as three or more consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> before 20 weeks' gestation without associated anatomic, cytogenetic, hormonal, and infectious pathologies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Eighty of 210 eligible women consented to participate and were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (20 mg/d) and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (20 mg/d) for the first 12 weeks of gestation, aspirin (100 mg/d) for 38 weeks of gestation, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (5 mg every second day) throughout their pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty of 80 women became pregnant; they were compared with 52 women with IRM (matched for age and number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>), who became pregnant without treatment during the same observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Live birth rate, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo>, and therapy-related side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): The overall live birth rates of the treatment and control groups were 77% (40 of 52) and 35% (18 of 52) (P=.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of first and second trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> among the treatment and control groups were 19% (10 of 52) and 0 (0 of 52), and 63% (33 of 52) and 2% (1 of 52), respectively (P=.09 and P=1.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median gestational age at birth and median birth weight did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed two and three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> among the treatment and control groups, respectively (P=.3) and no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 80 women who started treatment, one woman had an <z:mp ids='MP_0009668'>ectopic pregnancy</z:mp> and one woman terminated her pregnancy due to fetal chromosome aberration (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three women stopped treatment due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): A combination treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> is associated with a higher live birth rate compared with no treatment in women with IRM </plain></SENT>
