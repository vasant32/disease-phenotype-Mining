<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study prevalence of mutation C677T in gene 5.10-MTHFR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) as well as in persons free of symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> of the connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 85 patients participating in the study were divided into three groups: those with SLE (n = 17), with SLE + APS (n = 42), with primary APS (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 30 persons without SLE or APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>55% of the examinees had thrombotic complications of different location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the mutation was made using DNA isolated from the peripheral blood with standard methods and polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele (homozygous or heterozygous) condition of the mutation was confirmed by means of allele-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutation C677T in MTHFR gene was found in 40 of 85 patients (47%); 11(27.5%) had a homozygous variant, 29(72.5%)--heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C677T mutation occurred in 5 of 17 SLE patients (29%), it was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary and secondary APS mutation was detected in 51.5% (35 of 68 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>Recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in patients with mutation MTHFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three and more episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were registered in 17 of 40 patients with mutation C677T against 9 of 44 patients without the mutations (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Relationship between elevated blood levels of APL and MTHFR mutation points to the fact that this genetic marker is an additional thrombogenic factor in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mutation C677T in MTHFR gene in APS patients correlates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
