<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of women who had two or more pregnancy losses and who were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific type of pregnancy losses were determined in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our highly selected referral population, 76 of 366 women (21%) tested positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anticardiolipin antibodies of 20 or more immunoglobulin-G <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy loss occurred in 280 of 333 (84%) prior pregnancies in women with and 1240 of 1479 (84%) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 50% of pregnancy losses in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, compared with less than 15% in women who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 80% of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> had at least one fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, compared with less than 25% of women without (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two or more early first-trimester losses without fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> had a specificity of only 6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is more characteristic of the type of loss experienced by patients with recurrent pregnancy loss than early first-trimester pregnancy loss in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
