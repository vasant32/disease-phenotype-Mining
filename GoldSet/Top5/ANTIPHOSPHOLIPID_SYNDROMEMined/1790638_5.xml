<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of 64 consecutive and unselected SLE patients were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from the same patients taken during each clinical manifestation were tested for the presence of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aCL was 43.75% for the IgG isotype and 9.4% for the IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strong linkage between the presence of these antibodies and the occurrence of both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and abortions was found: a weaker association with neurological events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The titre of aCL appeared to be linked with the probability of having the clinical manifestations associated with these autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and abortion, and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, may be associated with the presence of aCL at the time when these clinical events develop in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
