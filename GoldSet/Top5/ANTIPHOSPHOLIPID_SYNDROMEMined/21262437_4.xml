<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the last 25 years numerous studies have established the correlation between the presence of antibodies against anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and thrombo-embolic manifestations but how these antibodies cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most scientists now accept the fact that only a subset of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> has clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not antibodies to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> but rather antibodies to β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I are thought to be the major cause for the pathological manifestations. β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I is a plasma protein without a known function and persons lacking β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I are completely healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our challenge is to understand why auto-antibodies against such a dispensable protein are so common and how antibodies directed against a protein without obvious function can induce the severe clinical manifestations observed in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
