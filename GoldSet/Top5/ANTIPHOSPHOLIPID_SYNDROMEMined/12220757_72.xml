<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of low-dose aspirin alone versus low-dose aspirin plus low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> as prophylaxis against pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> clinic, 119 consecutive women with persistently positive tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G and M antibody were invited to participate in a randomized, controlled trial between 1997 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After ethical approval and adherence to a written protocol, 12 women were unwilling to participate, five failed exclusion/inclusion criteria, and four were nonpregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory analysis was performed by Sheffield University Coagulation Department, electronically generated randomization by Manchester University Centre for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Epidemiology, and data collection and analysis by a research officer at Leeds University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Viability ultrasound every 2 weeks was provided until 12 weeks' gestation before transfer to the pregnancy support antenatal clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-eight women were randomized before 12 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven received low-dose aspirin 75 mg daily (group A), and 51 received low-dose aspirin plus low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 5000 U subcutaneously daily (group B) throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 13 pregnancy losses and 34 live births in group A and 11 losses and 40 live births in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The live-birth rate was 72% in group A and 78% in group B (odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.55, 3.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high success rate is achieved when low-dose aspirin is used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> does not significantly improve pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
