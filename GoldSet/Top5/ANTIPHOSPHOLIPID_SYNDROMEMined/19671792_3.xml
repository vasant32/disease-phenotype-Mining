<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, three different assays are conventionally accepted: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LA, described in the 1950s is a coagulation-based functional assay, which indirectly detects the presence of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aCL ELISA was developed in 1985; the identification of beta(2)GPI as a major target of aPL, allowed the introduction of anti-beta(2)GPI ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even if the diagnostic criteria for APS have been well defined, the laboratory detection of aPL is not always reproducible for many reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To achieve a univocal diagnostic definition of APS, efforts were made to reduce the inter- and/or intra-laboratory variability of the diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, we analyse the studies performed to standardise aPL assays that were developed within the European Forum on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
