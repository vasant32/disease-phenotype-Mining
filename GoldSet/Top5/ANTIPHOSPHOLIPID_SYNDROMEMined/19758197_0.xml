<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genetic background regarding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II alleles in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) only, in patients with SLE with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (SLE+SAPS), and in patients whose clinical course began as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and subsequently progressed to SLE (PAPS+SLE) in order to explain the phenotypical differences found in our previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those with primary or secondary APS present more thrombotic and less inflammatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal wastage was the highest in the PAPS+SLE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping in 63 patients (26, 22, and 15 in SLE only, SLE+SAPS, and PAPS+SLE groups, respectively) and in 57 healthy controls, using PCR with sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that, as reported in the literature, the occurrence of DRB1*03 and DQB1*0201 alleles was higher in SLE patients than in controls, but these alleles were rare in the PAPS+SLE group (13% in PAPS+SLE vs. 46% in the SLE only group; P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1*04 alleles were expressed frequently in both primary and secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DRB1*13, DQB1*06, and DQB1*0302 alleles were present more frequently in the PAPS+SLE patients than in the other groups, while the DQB1*0301 allele was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study we have shown that the SLE-associated DRB1*03/DQB1*02 alleles occurred frequently in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients as well as in SLE patients with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients who started as PAPS and later progressed to SLE, the allele frequency was fundamentally different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results confirmed that the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 profile of PAPS and SAPS is different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is unlikely that these alleles are responsible for the partly similar phenotype of the two groups </plain></SENT>
