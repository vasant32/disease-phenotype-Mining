<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The tendency for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and the criteria for its detection are well established, whereas the mechanism of this thrombophilic syndrome is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using immunofluorescent techniques and a microscopic spontaneous platelet aggregation test (mSPAT), we have previously demonstrated platelet binding by antibody followed by aggregation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated 18 anticardiolipin antibody-positive (ACLA pos.) patients, comprised of 12 primary APLS and 6 secondary APLS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated direct platelet microaggregate formation in 16/18 cases, whereas this finding was not present in 20 ACLA-negative (ACLA neg.) subjects (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect testing revealed 10/12 cases of platelet microaggregation and none in the ACLA neg. subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunofluorescent studies showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> complex binding occurred in 8/12 cases tested directly and in 11/12 cases in indirect testing, as compared to 1 out of 20 binding in ACLA neg. subjects (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody complex binding was inhibited in two cases by prior extraction of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation could be demonstrated in two ACLA neg. individuals by the addition of exogenous ACLA to platelets in EDTA-plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose a mechanism for immune-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APLS in which calcium-independent platelet aggregation, or thromboagglutination, is initiated by an ACLA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complex present in the patients' plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following the antibody complex-induced platelet agglutination, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> proceeds by release, recruitment, and fibrin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism should have important implications in the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of APLS </plain></SENT>
