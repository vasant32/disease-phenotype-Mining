<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolonged aPTT due to circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (CAC) may serve as a more specific laboratory marker of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a hospital-based study, we examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CAC and included 23 who fulfilled standard criteria for primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were assessed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among CAC-positive APS patients, 13 of the 23 (56%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> and these were significantly older (mean age+/-S.E., 68+/-3 years) than the nondemented APS group (n=10, 51+/-4 years; p&lt;0.01, Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> patients had significantly more pathology on computerized brain tomography (CT) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies but six of them had no clinical or CT evidence of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly lower in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> group, in which there was also a significant negative correlation between levels of aPL and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CAC-positive APS patients seem to be at risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with age, suggesting a pathogenic role for prolonged exposure to elevated aPL </plain></SENT>
