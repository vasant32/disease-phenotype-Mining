<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 38 babies born after 36 pregnancies of 33 women diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with a group of 38 control infants matched for the same gestational age at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 76 newborns we studied the maternal events associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, mothers' treatment and neonatal data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were treated with low-dense aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> was only prescribed due to maternal complications and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in a case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant relation was found between maternal treatment and neonatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> rate in these newborns was high 14% and the neonatal mortality (5.8%) was only associated with extreme <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our population the overall rate of neonatal complications was higher than in the general population, but when compared with a similar group of newborns no significant differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> appears to be improved by low-dose aspirin treatment, with a high rate of neonatal survival (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Except for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> and its potential associated complications, fetal and neonatal outcome is very favourable and no significant relation between maternal treatment and neonatal pathology has been detected </plain></SENT>
