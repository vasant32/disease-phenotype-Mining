<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of IgG infusion on peripheral T-cell subpopulations in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen women with a history of three previous RPL between 6 and 22 weeks of gestation and positivity for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) were randomized to one of two treatment groups: (a) an intravenous immunoglobulin therapy group (RPL-IVIg; 7 patients), 500 mg IVIg/kg/month and (b) a placebo-treated group given multivitamins (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control groups comprised either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women without APS (10 patients) or non-pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T-cell markers were characterized using a monoclonal antibody panel including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD29, CD38, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD54 and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed with a two-color fluorescent-activated flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first trimester, the percentage of CD4+CD25+, CD4+CD45RO+, CD8+HLA-DR+, and CD8+CD38+ populations were reduced in the multivitamin group compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women (p &lt; 0.05) while in the RPL-IVIg group only CD4+CD25+ cells were reduced (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By the second trimester, CD3+CD16+CD56+ was significantly higher in multivitamin- than in IVIg-treated women (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD4+HLA-DR+ was significantly higher in the two RPL groups compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IVIg therapy in women with RPL was associated with a significant reduction in CD3+CD16+CD56+ and CD4+CD25+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to the suppression of immune-mediated processes contributing to premature abortion </plain></SENT>
