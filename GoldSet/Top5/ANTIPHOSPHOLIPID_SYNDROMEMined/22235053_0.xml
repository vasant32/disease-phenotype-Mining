<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS had different manifestations of reproductive pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> (as a consequence of extreme T-cell activation obtained in the course of pretreatment), and lowering of fecundity (as a consequence of polyclonal B-cell stimulation), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In BALB/c mice <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> coincided with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and CFA pretreatments, while in C57BL/6 mice lowering of fecundity was most obvious in CFA-pretreated mice immunized with TTd in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33130">aluminium hydroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both molecular mimicry and polyclonal B-cell activation occur in APS induction, with molecular mimicry effects being dominant in BALB/c mice, and polyclonal cell activation being dominant in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of molecular mimicry effects, which in the condition of T-cell stimulation generated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> in the BALB/c strain, was achieved by passive infusion of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T-26 specific for TTd and anti-Î²(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I obtained after TTd hyperimunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High polyclonal B-cell activation in C57BL/6 mice prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> but induced fecundity lowering, as was the case in passive administration of MoAb T-26 in this mouse strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Passive infusion of anti-idiotypic MoAb Y7 into C57BL/6 mice induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> and confirmed the above suggestion on the protective role of polyclonal B-cell stimulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
