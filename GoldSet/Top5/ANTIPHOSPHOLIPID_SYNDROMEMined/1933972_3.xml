<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve (86%) of 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 3 (42%) of 7 patients with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic events had echocardiographic evidence of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features characteristic of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were present in 12 (86%) of the 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association between valvular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, combined with the clinical and radiologic features noted, suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> related to the Acla syndrome typically are embolic, from a cardiac source </plain></SENT>
