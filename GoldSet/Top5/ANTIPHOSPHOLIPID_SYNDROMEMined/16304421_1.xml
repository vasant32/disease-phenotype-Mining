<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is an antibody-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> characterized by recurrent venous and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have determined that the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in patients presenting with a venous thromboembolic event is between 4% and 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> in these patients, current recommendations suggest a longer, potentially lifelong, course of antithrombotic therapy following an initial event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most authorities agree on an extended course of therapy, considerable controversy surrounds the optimal target therapeutic INR for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For an initial venous thromboembolic event, a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is supported by two prospective, randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, relatively limited data exist for an initial arterial thromboembolic event in patients who have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and therapeutic recommendations range from aspirin to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with a high target INR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> can be extremely difficult to treat, and some patients may benefit from the addition of immunosuppressive therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, as many as 50% of the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> sustained by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> occur in the setting of additional, coincident prothrombotic risk factors, indicating the importance of addressing any additional risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed to address the role of thromboprophylactic strategies in asymptomatic individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the absence of additional risk factors </plain></SENT>
