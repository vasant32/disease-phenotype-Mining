<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (a beta 2 GP-I) in the serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied alpha beta 2 GP-I by Western blot, dot blot, and ELISA in 94 patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) by clinical and serological criteria, 33 had neither of these features, 18 had the clinical criteria for APS but no serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL). and 22 had positive aPL but no related clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, we also studied 76 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera were also inhibited with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> micelles and tested for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) or a beta GP-I activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five of 39 patients with SLE with clinical manifestations of APS has serum a beta 2 GP-I, while only 2 of 55 patients with SLE without such clinical manifestations had them (p = 0.000000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with SLE with clinical APS but aPL negative were a beta GP-I positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 35 patients with SLE who were a beta 2 GP-I positive had vascular manifestations, but these antibodies were present in only 4 of 55 patients with SLE without vascular manifestations (p = 0.00000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient having either aPL or a beta 2 GP-I had clinical manifestations of APS, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 patients positive for both antibodies had clinical APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The a beta 2 GP-I positive, aPL negative patients with SLE had clinical APS more frequently (16/18) than did a beta GP-I negative, aPL positive patients with SLE (2/24) (p = 0.000000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association of clinical manifestations of APS with a beta 2 GP-I was stronger than with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies also indicate that aPL and a beta 2 GP-I are 2 different antigen/antibody systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the so called APS associates strongly with antibodies recognizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There are patients' sera that also recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and/or its cofactor beta 2 GP-I, the latter perhaps by reacting with a neoepitope on this protein that appears after its interaction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These would be the previously considered (beta 2 GP-I dependent) aCL </plain></SENT>
