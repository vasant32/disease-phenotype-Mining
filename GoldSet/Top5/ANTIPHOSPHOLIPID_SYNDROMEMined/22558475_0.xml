<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the aPL antibodies, aCL is the most sensitive for APS, however, their lack of specificity constitute a laboratory and clinical challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG/IgM antibodies directed against APhL (a mixture of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>) has been reported to predict APS more reliably than aCL tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of the APhL IgG/IgM ELISA, relative to the aCL and aβ(2)GPI tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen (16) clinically confirmed APS and 85 previously tested serum (PTS) samples for aCL and aβ(2)GPI IgG/IgM antibodies were evaluated with the APhL IgG/IgM ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical specificity was determined in 100 serum samples (50 healthy and 50 infectious disease controls [parvo- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>-IgG/IgM positive]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IgG antibody prevalence for aCL and APhL in the APS and PST groups was comparable with marginal differences in clinical specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the aCL IgM ELISA, the APhL test showed improved clinical specificities (72% aCL vs 94% APhL in the healthy controls; 38% aCL vs 78% APhL in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> controls) with implications for increased reliability in the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall agreement of the APhL with the aCL or aβ(2)GPI for the IgG tests was 89% and 85% respectively, and that of the APhL IgM to the aCL or aβ(2)GPI IgM tests was 72% and 86% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Routine use of the APhL IgG/IgM ELISA may substantially reduce the high number of false positives associated with the aCL test without loss in sensitivity for APS </plain></SENT>
