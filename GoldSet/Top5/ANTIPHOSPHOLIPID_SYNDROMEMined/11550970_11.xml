<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a French tertiary referral center experience in the treatment of pregnancies in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of the data of 75 consecutive pregnancies in 47 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After exclusion of induced abortions and pregnancies occurring before APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the prior live birth rate was 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine pregnancies occurred in women with history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 17 with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was prescribed in 39 pregnancies, associated with aspirin in 35 cases, and aspirin alone was used in 36 as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> were prescribed in 38 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three pregnancies by in vitro fertilization led to one embryonic loss, one full term birth, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six pregnancies treated with immunoglobulin ended in one fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 2 premature and 3 full term deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the other 66 pregnancies was one embryonic loss, 8 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 16 prematurates, and 38 full term births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> correlated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (p = 0.005), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (p = 0.014), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (p = 0.005), and presence of disease associated to APS (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of one fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with congenital anomaly, live birth rate was 72.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for higher rate of fetal survival in patients without history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (84.6 vs 66.4%; p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Obstetrical prognosis in APS was improved by antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Studies are needed to define individual risk and specific significance of the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, in order to improve the respective indications for aspirin alone or with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in women without thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
