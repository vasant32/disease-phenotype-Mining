<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten murine monoclonal aPL were generated from spleen cells of PL/J mice immunized with TIFI, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> spanning Thr(101)-Thr(120) of ULB0-HCMVA from human cytomegalovirus (CMV), which shares structural similarity with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The antibodies generated had aPL activity that was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> liposomes, and this inhibition was enhanced in the presence of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the antibodies exhibited binding to cultured endothelial cells in vitro, and some had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Injection with 2 of the monoclonal aPL in mice resulted in a significant increase in the number of leukocytes adhering to endothelial cells and enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that aPL induced by immunization with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding CMV <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> are pathogenic in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest a mechanism (molecular mimicry) by which pathogenic aPL may be generated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
