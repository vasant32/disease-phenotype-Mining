<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Splenectomy has been performed to treat refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some reports have suggested that an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be present in splenectomized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to evaluate the possibility of an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after splenectomy in patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Thrombotic-related events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), before and after splenectomy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data, laboratory investigations, and anticoagulation or antiaggregation treatment data were collected from the notes of outpatients attending three European centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Twenty patients who had had a splenectomy were identified: eight with SLE, five with PAPS, and seven with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time between diagnosis and splenectomy was 3.1 years and mean follow-up was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in anticardiolipin antibody titers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anti-DNA or anti-nuclear antibodies before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of venous events before and after splenectomy was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards an increase in the total number of arterial events post-splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In aCL-positive patients, and in the pre-splenectomy period, the total number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> was higher (p=0.017), as was the number of patients who had had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (p=0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The total risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with PAPS and SLE was not increased after splenectomy, but there was a trend towards an increase in the number of arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy induced long-term remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (partial or complete) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
