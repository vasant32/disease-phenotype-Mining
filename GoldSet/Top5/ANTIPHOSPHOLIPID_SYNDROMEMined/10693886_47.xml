<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We classified 243 consecutive patients who had clinical diagnoses of primary APS (n = 49), secondary APS (n = 26), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) without clinical APS (n = 131), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease without clinical APS (n = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.71, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.88, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>False-negative findings were the result of patients being classified on the basis of minor criteria that were not included in the Sapporo criteria, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, low-titer IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibody, IgA anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some patients with false-negative results were true seronegative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Sapporo criteria for APS compare favorably with the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE and are usable for clinical studies </plain></SENT>
