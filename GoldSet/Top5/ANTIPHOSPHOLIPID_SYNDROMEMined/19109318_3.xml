<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This risk is particularly elevated if aPLs are dosable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was planned to evaluate maternal-fetal outcomes of different groups of SLE pregnant patients characterized by diverse risk factors: patients affected by APS treated with a combination of low-dose aspirin (LDA) and low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), nulliparous patients with dosable aPL treated by LMWH and SLE patients with no aPL administered no treatment during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective description of maternal and fetal outcomes was made in a total of 62 pregnancies presenting APS in 8 cases (12.9%), aPL in 20 (32.2%) and no aPL in 34 (54.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found comparing fetal and maternal outcomes of the three groups despite differences in SLE activity: SLE aPL-positive pregnancies were associated with a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than pregnancies treated for APS or not presenting with the added risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> is 15% in aPL positive, 12.5% in APS and 14.7% in no aPL pregnancies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LMWH is rather a possible option of prophylaxis for SLE aPL-positive pregnancies with potential maternal-fetal outcomes similar to aPL-negative patients or to standard treated APS </plain></SENT>
