<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The persistent presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) may lead to the development of primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the genetic basis of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> has been suggested, the identity of the underlying genes is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in an effort to identify susceptibility loci/genes for three main <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>: anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), and anti- β 2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti- β 2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array containing 906,600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association of SNPs with the antibody status (positive/negative) was tested using logistic regression under the additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have identified a number of suggestive novel loci with P &lt; E - 05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although they do not meet the conservative threshold of genome-wide significance, many of the suggestive loci are potential candidates for the production of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We have replicated the previously reported associations of HLA genes and APOH with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> but these were not the top loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have identified a number of suggestive novel loci for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> that will stimulate follow-up studies in independent and larger samples to replicate our findings </plain></SENT>
