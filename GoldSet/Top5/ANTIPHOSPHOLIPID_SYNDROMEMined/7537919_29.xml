<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both PL and beta 2GPI seem necessary for binding, thus indicating that the two components comprise the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> against which aPL are directed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an anti-beta 2GPI antibody ELISA with the antigen adsorbed onto <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53243">polyvinylchloride</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) plates, we detected high antibody titres in 12 out of 12 plasma from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No or very low positivity was obtained when the same ELISA was carried out in <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> (PST) plates, while an increasing positivity was found when processed (i.e. more hydrophilic) or COOH-surface PST plates were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When beta 2GPI dependent IgG-aPL were purified using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>-immobilized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, 4 out of 4 preparations were highly positive in anti-beta 2GPI antibody ELISA using <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> plates, while beta 2GPI was not fully recognized by aPL-IgG when adsorbed onto PST plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that aPL are, in fact, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies directed against a cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> which is expressed when beta 2GPI is bound to anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, or another suitable surface </plain></SENT>
