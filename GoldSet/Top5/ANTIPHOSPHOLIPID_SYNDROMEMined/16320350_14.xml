<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that some plasmin-reactive anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) may bind to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and that some of the tPA-reactive aCL may inhibit tPA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the reactivity of 8 patient-derived monoclonal aCL with tPA and examined the presence of IgG anti-tPA antibodies in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of the reactive monoclonal aCL on the activity of tPA were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patient-derived plasmin-reactive monoclonal aCL bound to tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of plasma samples revealed that 10 of 80 APS patients (12.5%) and 1 of 81 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> patients (1.2%) had antibodies against fibrin-associated tPA, based on a cutoff value equal to the mean + 2SD of the level in 28 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 tPA-reactive monoclonal aCL, 2 of them (CL1 and CL15) inhibited tPA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some of the plasmin-reactive aCL in APS patients may bind to tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the tPA-reactive aCL, some (such as CL1 and CL15) may inhibit tPA activity and, thus, may be prothrombotic in the host </plain></SENT>
