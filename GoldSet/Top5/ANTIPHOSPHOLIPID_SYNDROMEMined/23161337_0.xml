<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Tetanus</z:e> toxoid (TTd) and plasma protein β(2)GPI share structural homology so that immunization with TTd induces appearance of cross-reactive antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we have investigated the presence and dynamic of fluctuation of specific (anti-TTd) and auto (anti-β(2)GPI) antibodies induced in BALB/c mice during secondary immune response after TTd immunization with alhydrogel or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> as adjuvants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we followed the induced reproductive pathology as a sign of autoimmune outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show undoubtedly adjuvant dependance of (1) level of induced anti-TTd IgG antibodies, (2) changes in levels of low-affinity anti-β(2)GPI IgG antibodies, and (3) change in fecundity and fertility during secondary immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings once more indicate the importance of chosen adjuvants used for successful immunization and eventual autoantibody outcome, this time associated with the processes involving low affinity, natural antibodies </plain></SENT>
