<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A further aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gender on expression and morbidity of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from the medical records of 59 male and 535 female patients with SLE who were diagnosed at the hospitals in the region of Thessaloniki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several differences in the expression and morbidity of the disease were found in relation to the gender of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male patients had a higher prevalence of thromboses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> when compared with female patients, but tended to present less often with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> as the initial clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 5-year follow-up, positive associations have been found between male gender and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039503" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tendonitis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, particularly of the respiratory tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has provided information regarding the features of clinical expression and morbidity in male patients, and has shown that gender is a possible factor that can influence the clinical expression of SLE </plain></SENT>
