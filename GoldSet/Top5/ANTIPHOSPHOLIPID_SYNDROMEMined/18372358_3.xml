<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the development of atheroma is rather controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> could induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> via vascular functional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD1 mice received one single injection of antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies derived from male (BXSB x NZW) F1 mice with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease associated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week later, first-order mesenteric arteries (diameter 220-260 microm) were isolated and mounted on a small-vessel myograph for the measurement of the relaxation responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> or the NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> after precontraction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five out of eight antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies reduced the response to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> compared with control mice, and this effect was especially marked with one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No change in the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impairment was maintained after 3 weeks of treatment and appeared related to a moderate decrease in NO-mediated responses and a marked decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi>-mediated relaxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These vascular functional changes could be prevented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> or aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data could constitute additional elements supporting a direct pathogenic role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a sub-population of these autoantibodies could be responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
