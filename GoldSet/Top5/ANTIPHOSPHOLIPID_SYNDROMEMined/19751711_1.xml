<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To clarify the association and diagnostic utility of measuring antiphosphatidyl serine (aPS), antiprothrombin (aPT) and the antiphosphatidyl serine/prothrombin complex (aPS/PT) antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We measured IgG and IgM anti-aPS/PT (2 different kits) as well as the aPS and aPT autoantibodies by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were also tested for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), IgG and IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I (ass(2)GPI), and these served as the gold standard unless otherwise indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients were studied: (i) APS with RPL and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=62); (ii) RPL only (n=66) and a group of healthy women with successful pregnancies (WSP; n=30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under curve (AUC) analyses demonstrated significant differences between the aPS/PT (0.980) and aPT (0.850) assays (p=0.002) with no significant differences between the 2 aPS/PT kits or the aPS/PT and aPS assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall agreement between the tested aPL antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) for the APS cohort was very poor but associations between aPL assays were substantial (kappa&gt;0.5) as determined by Cohen kappa analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a lack of association between aPS/PT antibodies and LA in APS patients with recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the evaluation of these patients, there may be redundancy in testing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three markers as the aPT and aPS assays formed part of the aPS/PT antibody repertoire </plain></SENT>
