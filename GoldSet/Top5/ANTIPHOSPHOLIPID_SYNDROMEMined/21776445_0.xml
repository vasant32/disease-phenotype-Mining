<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Anti-β2 GPI are a formal laboratory criterion for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were demonstrated to be a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal losses but can also be detected in patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (SAD), in healthy adults individuals and pre-school children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that different subpopulations of anti-β2GPI may carry different pathogenetic potential: autoantibodies against Domain1 seem to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; autoantibodies against Domain4/5 have been identified in patients with non-thrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 48 patients with SAD (32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 16 undifferentiated connettive tissue disease), 64 patients with APS, 57 one-year-old healthy children born to mother with SAD, 33 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were IgG anti-β2 GPI positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specificity of anti-β2 GPI was investigated using ELISA research products containing recombinant β2 GPI D1 and D4/5 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cut-off values are calculated as 95th percentile on 100 NHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-β2 GPI were tested at a validated home-made ELISA routinely performed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic events were recordered in patients with SAD and in both groups of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SAD and APS showed prevalent reactivity for D1 while children in both groups preferentially recognize D4/5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IgG anti-β2 GPI against D1 seem to cluster in patients with systemic autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their pathogenic potential in determine APS manifestations may be mitigated by adequate prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
