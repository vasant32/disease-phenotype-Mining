<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those with primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and with diffuse diseases of connecting tissues were not included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical, neurological, electroencephalographic and immunological examination, the latter including the determination of ABPL level, namely the level of AB to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the blood serum using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the ABPL level was 1,5-2,0 times higher in patients comparing to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increase was observed in patients with moderate and high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and a history of at least 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ABPL level was depended on the etiologic factor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> EEG activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that ABPL not only interact with vessel endothelium but caused the immunologically mediated damage of cortical neurons that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
