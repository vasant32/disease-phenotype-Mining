<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A failure to adequately inactivate thrombin such as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> generates a strong prothrombotic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study if and to what extent delayed thrombin inactivation rates beyond <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> contribute to the prothrombotic phenotype we measured thrombin inhibition profiles in plasma samples obtained from 16 healthy individuals and 39 thrombophilic patients, including 17 patients diagnosed positive for anti-prothrombin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test thrombin inhibition, thrombin was added to plasma, and endogenous thrombin inhibition stopped by addition of the reversible thrombin inhibitor argatroban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the amount of argatroban-complexed thrombin was measured using an oligonucleotide-based enzyme capture assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma thrombin at concentrations up to 4 ng/ml (109 pM) became inactivated with an average half-life time of 56.4 ± 4.7 seconds (s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In antithrombin-deficient plasma the thrombin half-life was prolonged to 168.2 ± 14.9 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the thrombophilic patients, only one with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> showed impaired thrombin inactivation rates, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients including the antiphospholipid positive patients showed thrombin inhibiting capacities within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that thrombin added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human plasma at subthreshold levels of ~100 pM or below becomes inactivated with a half-life time below 1 minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> do not prolong thrombin half-life times, making it unlikely that delayed thrombin inactivation contributes to the thrombotic phenotype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, plasma levels of antithrombin falling below 80% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> markedly prolong the thrombin half-life </plain></SENT>
