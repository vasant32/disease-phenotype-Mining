<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI is involved in coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, including inhibition of contact activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coagulation factor XII is an initiator of intrinsic coagulation and also of intrinsic fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of aCL (= anti-beta2GPI antibodies), regarding intrinsic fibrinolysis using autoimmune monoclonal anti-beta2GPI antibodies derived from a patient with APS or from an NZW/BXSB-F1 mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We developed a chromogenic assay system to determine intrinsic fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reaction was activated by kaolin in the euglobulin fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous beta2GPI slightly suppressed intrinsic fibrinolytic activity of the euglobulin fraction from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human monoclonal anti-beta2GPI antibody (EY2C9) and mouse monoclonal anti-beta2GPI antibody (WBCAL-1) in the presence of beta2GPI decreased the activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this system, the suppression remained significant in the presence of an excess of exogenous activated factor XII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Euglobulin fractions from APS patients' plasma paralleled low activities of intrinsic fibrinolysis compared with those from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that beta2GPI and anti-beta2GPI antibodies suppress intrinsic fibrinolytic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suppression was not only due to inhibition of factor XII activation but was also related to function of activated factor XII (XIIa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These phenomena partly explain the mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
