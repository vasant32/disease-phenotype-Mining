<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Should anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) be detectable, this risk is significantly raised, particularly when these autoanti-bodies are cofactor-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>We conducted a cross-sectional study of consecutive unselected outpatients referred for clinical suspicion of DVT, as an attempt to address the following questions: firstly, were aCL antibodies associated with DVT in non-SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Secondly, was this association related to the cofactor dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From March 1992 to February 1994, 208 patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venography was positive in 110 patients (DVT patients), while the diagnosis of DVT could not be confirmed in the remaining 98 (referred to as disease controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACL was measured by ELISA, for IgG and IgM isotypes in two ways: fetal calf serum or bovine serum albumin were used as blocking agents to distinguish between cofactor-dependent and cofactor-independent antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive aCL was defined as optical density (OD) values greater than the 95th percentile of OD distribution of 60 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a high frequency of positive IgG aCL antibodies in both DVT patients and in disease controls (25.5 vs 23.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest an association between IgM aCL and DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association was, however, not dependent on the cofactor requirement </plain></SENT>
