<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL are necessary, but not sufficient for the clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggests a role of innate immune cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and Toll-like receptors (TLR) to be additionally involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPL activate endothelial cells and monocytes through a TLR4-dependent signalling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether this is also relevant for PMN in a similar way is currently not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we used purified PMN from healthy donors and stimulated them in the presence or absence of human monoclonal aPL and the TLR4 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> LPS monitoring neutrophil effector functions, namely the oxidative burst, phagocytosis, L-Selectin shedding and IL-8 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>aPL alone were only able to induce minor activation of PMN effector functions at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the additional presence of LPS the activation threshold was markedly lower indicating a synergistic activation pathway of aPL and TLR in PMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results indicate that PMN effector functions are directly activated by aPL and boosted by the additional presence of microbial products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This highlights a role for PMN as important innate immune effector cells that contribute to the pathophysiology of APS </plain></SENT>
