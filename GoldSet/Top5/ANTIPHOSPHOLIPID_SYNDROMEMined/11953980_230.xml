<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and immunologic manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in a large cohort of patients and to define patterns of disease expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and serologic features of APS (Sapporo preliminary criteria) in 1,000 patients from 13 European countries were analyzed using a computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 820 female patients (82.0%) and 180 male patients (18.0%) with a mean +/- SD age of 42 +/- 14 years at study entry. "Primary" APS was present in 53.1% of the patients; APS was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in 36.2%, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> in 5.0%, and with other diseases in 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A variety of thrombotic manifestations affecting the majority of organs were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A catastrophic APS occurred in 0.8% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS associated with SLE had more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and more frequently exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male patients had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in the lower legs and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 28 patients (2.8%), disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> occurred before age 15; these patients had more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 127 patients (12.7%), disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> occurred after age 50; most of these patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, but a lower frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, than the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS may affect any organ of the body and display a broad spectrum of manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An association with SLE, the patient's sex, and the patient's age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> can modify the disease expression and define specific subsets of APS </plain></SENT>
