<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden) on its own, however, appears to have no significant effect in this regard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> caused by coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a patient with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> who was found to have a coexistence of heterozygous factor V Leiden and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since both thrombophilic disorders interfere with the protein C <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> system, the simultaneous existence of inherited and acquired resistance against activated protein C could account for an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> with manifestation in the coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that evaluation of patients who present with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary events should also consider these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation defects</z:e> </plain></SENT>
