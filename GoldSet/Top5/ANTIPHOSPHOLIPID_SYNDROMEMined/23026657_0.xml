<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coagulation tests for LAC as well as solid phase assays for aCL and aβ2GPI have methodological shortcomings, although for LAC large progress have been made in standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assays are associated with clinical APS-criteria (thrombotic and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e>) but with limited specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, clinical studies demonstrating the association between the presence of aPL and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are not always well designed and result in wide ranges of odds ratio with large variation between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best association between thrombotic complications and aPL is found for LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aCL or aβ2GPI is at least inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of more specific assays, such as the domain-I-β2GPI.antibodies is too premature and depends on further investigation in large clinical studies and the commercial availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The search for new assays should proceed to identify patients with aPL with increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, preferable in large prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, with the current available LAC, aCL and aβ2GPI assays it is strongly recommended to make antibody profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple positivity of tests seems clinically more relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strengths and weaknesses of the current laboratory criteria for APS are discussed in view of their role in risk stratification of patients with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
