<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The mechanisms for the fetal loss in this syndrome have not yet been clearly elucidated, although several hypothesis based on experimental data have been put forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wanted to evaluated the effect in vitro of anticardiolipin antibodies on the secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Employing our previous experience with placental explants, we studied the effect of several mouse monoclonal and human polyclonal purified anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), which were shown by us to induce experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS), to affect the pulsatile secretion of beta human choriogonadotropin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mouse monoclonal ACA antibodies caused an increase in the pulsatility of beta human choriogonadotropin, while human polyclonal ACA derived from patients with ACA had an inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These studies with placental explants show that ACA may have an additional effect on placental hormone secretion and thus affect the fate of the embryo </plain></SENT>
