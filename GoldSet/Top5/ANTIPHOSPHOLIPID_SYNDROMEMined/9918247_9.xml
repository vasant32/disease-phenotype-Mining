<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether serial anticardiolipin determination contributes to the clinical management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with no previous sign of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 90 patients with SLE with no previous clinical manifestations of the APS, repeated clinical evaluations were performed, and serial blood samples (obtained over a 30 month period, range 13-53 mo) were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were detected using an ELISA and considered positive if the result was &gt;25 GPL on 2 separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were not required to be on a specific treatment regimen during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (37%) had at least one positive ELISA and 11 (11/90, 12%) 2 positive ELISA for IgG aCL during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) was found in 16 patients, and a false positive VDRL in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At study completion, the total number of clinical or laboratory events associated with APS was 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, aCL was significantly associated only with LAC (p&lt;0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presence of aCL also correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, anti-DNA antibody, leukocyte count, and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC and aCL were significantly associated with each other (OR 5.17; 95% CI 1.5-17.7), but LAC had a better positive predictive value than aCL for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among our patients with SLE without previous clinical manifestations of APS, positive aCL did not predict the occurrence of APS within the next 3 years, but was statistically related to the clinical disease activity (SLEDAI) </plain></SENT>
