<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical observational data of patients with PE in Peking University Third Hospital from November 2008 to January 2011 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis was made among medical conditions with PE (M-PE) sub-group and isolated PE (I-PE) sub-group and non-PE pregnancy with or without medical conditions (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Totally 159 cases, 43.09% (159/369) of total cases of PE had high clinical risk factors (multiple pregnancy and medical conditions) and 32.3% (97/300) of singleton PE accompanied with medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PE in singleton <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0565879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancies with medical conditions</z:e> was significantly higher than those without medical conditions [15.0% (97/646) versus 4.45% (210/4719), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In M-PE sub-group, the average age [(31.7 ± 4.5) versus (29.3 ± 5.2) year-old] and body mass index (BMI) in first trimester [(26.0 ± 5.6) versus (23.3 ± 3.7) kg/m(2)], the proportion with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> [11% (11/97) versus 4.9% (10/203)] and pregnancy loss in third trimester [11% (11/97) versus 3.0% (6/203)], were higher than those of I-PE sub-group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> in M-PE sub-group was earlier than I-PE (32.9 versus 34.4 gestation weeks, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion serious cases of PE occurring before 32 gestational weeks were higher in M-PE than that of I-PE sub-group [45% (44/97) versus 34.0% (69/203), P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis showed that previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss and irregular prenatal care were clinical risk factors for early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> PE whether early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was defined as &lt; 34 or &lt; 32 gestational weeks respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05); medical conditions were risk factors for PE if early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was defined as &lt; 32 gestational weeks (OR = 1.718, 95%CI: 1.005 - 2.937, P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple pregnancies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0565879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancies with medical conditions</z:e> exceed one-third of total subjects of PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PE in subjects with maternal underlying medical conditions was earlier which is the subgroup should not be ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference of early pregnancy BMI may show the maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Assessment of clinical risk factors including the underlying medical disorders for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> in early trimester should be strengthened </plain></SENT>
