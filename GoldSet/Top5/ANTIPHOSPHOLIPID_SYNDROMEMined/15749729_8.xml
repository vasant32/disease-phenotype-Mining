<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation of the endothelium is a key event in the establishment of the thrombophilic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the intracellular mechanisms leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> are not fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pro-adhesive state elicited by aPL and studied ROS-dependent downstream signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with IgG (IgG-APS) from 12 APS patients caused a large and sustained increase in ROS, which was prevented by the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetyl-L-cysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ROS inhibition observed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33079">diphenylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50317">iodonium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi> indicated an involvement of a membrane-bound oxidase and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transport chain as sources of ROS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROS acted as a second messenger by activating the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase and its subsequent target, the stress-related transcription factor activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ROS controlled the up-regulation of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 expression by IgG-APS-stimulated HUVEC and the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 monocytic cells <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IgG-APS-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> was observed irrespective of the clinical and biological criterions of the patients studied here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> induced by IgG-APS is a key intracellular event that might contribute to the thrombotic complications of APS by controlling the endothelial adhesive phenotype </plain></SENT>
