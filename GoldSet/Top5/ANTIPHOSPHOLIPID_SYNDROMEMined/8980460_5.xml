<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, with or without protein cofactor(s), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding proteins alone have been proposed as the target molecules for aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> degradation products on the binding of aPL, sera from 6 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fresh and aged phosphatidylserine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> were used as coating reagents in solid-phase immunoassay procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody reactivity was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the sera and in eluates from columns packed with <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> scrapings coated with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or phoshatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three reaction patterns of affinity-purified antibodies were seen: (1) reactivity with phosphatidylserine but not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or degraded phosphatidylserine, (2) reactivity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and degraded phosphatidlyserine, and (3) reactivity with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Striking differences in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> reactivity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine and degraded phosphatidylserine in the presence of serum proteins were observed among patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analyses showed that the degradation of phosphatidylserine influences the binding of aPL in in vitro assays </plain></SENT>
