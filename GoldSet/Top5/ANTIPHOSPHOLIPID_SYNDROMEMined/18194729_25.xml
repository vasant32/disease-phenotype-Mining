<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL; and in particular anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies) are formal diagnostic markers and pathogenic antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although APS may be considered as an autoantibody-mediated disease, there is now evidence that aPL are necessary but not sufficient to trigger some of the clinical manifestations of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, additional factors, such as mediators of the innate immunity are now recognized to play a key role as second hits able to induce the thrombotic events in the presence of the autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APS scenario is also supplemented by the influence of genetically determined factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, environmental agents - in particular infectious ones - were reported to act as triggers for the production of autoantibodies cross-reacting with PL-binding proteins as well as inflammatory stimuli that potentiate the aPL thrombogenic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether these findings do support the concept of a mosaic of factors that participate to the pathogenesis of the syndrome at different levels </plain></SENT>
