<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are two methods for antiprothrombin EIA; one that uses high binding plates (aPT-A), and another that utilizes phosphatidylserine bound plates (aPS/PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate and compare aPT-A and aPS/PT in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed EIA for anti-PT, anti-PS/PT, IgG, and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and IgG beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-dependent aCL (abeta2GPI/CL) with serum samples from 139 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients (16 with history of at least one thrombotic episode) and 148 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that: (1) although titers of anti-PT and anti-PS/PT were significantly related with each other (P &lt; 0.0001, rho = 0.548), titer of anti-PT and anti-PS/PT differed greatly in some samples; (2) odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for each assay was 3.556 (1.221-10.355) for aPT-A, 4.591 (1.555-15.560) for aPS/PT, 4.204 (1.250-14.148) for IgG aCL, 1.809 (0.354-9.232) for IgM aCL, and 7.246 (2.391-21.966) for abeta2GPI/CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EIA performed in this study except IgM aCL are of potential value in assessing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, aPS/PT and abeta2GPI/CL seemed to be highly valuable in clinical practice, and that autoantibodies detected by anti-PT and anti-PS/PT are not completely identical </plain></SENT>
