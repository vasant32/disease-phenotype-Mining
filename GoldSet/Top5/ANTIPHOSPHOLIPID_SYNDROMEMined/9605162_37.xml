<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that: 1) recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> beta 2GPI bound to HUVEC and was recognized by both human monoclonal IgM and affinity-purified polyclonal IgG anti-beta 2GPI anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome Abs; and 2) a single amino acid change from Lys286 to Glu significantly reduced endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Double and triple mutants (from Lys284,287 to Glu284,287, from Lys286,287 to Glu286,287, and from Lys284,286,287 to Glu284,286,287) completely abolished endothelial binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (P1) spanning the sequence Glu274-Cys288 of the beta 2GPI fifth domain still displayed endothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (P8), identical with P1 except that Cys281 and Cys288 were substituted with serine residues, did not bind to HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2GPI Abs, once bound to P1 adhered to HUVEC, induced E-selectin expression and up-regulated IL-6 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control experiments conducted with irrelevant Abs as well as with the P8 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> did not show any endothelial Ab binding nor E-selectin and IL-6 modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that: 1) beta 2GPI binds to endothelial cells through its fifth domain; 2) the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site that mediates the binding to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> is also involved in endothelial binding; 3) HUVEC provide a suitable surface for beta 2GPI binding comparable to that displayed by anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> dried on microtiter wells; and 4) the formation of the complex between beta 2GPI and the specific Abs leads to endothelial activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
