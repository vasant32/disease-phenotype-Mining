<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: A new commercial <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> clotting time (SCT), the HemosIL SCT assay (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) was evaluated in the laboratory diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This integrated test system for screening and confirmation was compared with the frequently used aPTT-based PTT-LA and Staclot-LA (Diagnostica Stago, Asni√®res, France) in a patient population investigated for LAC and in a subpopulation who met the clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 201 samples were analysed with the HemosIL SCT assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Own reference values were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results are expressed as measured clotting times in seconds or as normalised ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCT screen and PTT-LA had a sensitivity of, 61.1% and 63.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normalising the results gained sensitivity up to 72.2% and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The confirmation SCT and the Staclot-LA had a sensitivity of 30.6% and 63.9% with a specificity of 86.7% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of SCT for detecting LAC in clinical criteria positive patients was lower compared to aPTT and dRVVT (45.8% versus 66.7% and 65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination of SCT/dRVVT and aPTT/dRVVT gave a sensitivity of 51.2% and 63.6%, with a specificity of 50.0% and 52.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with PTT-LA as screening test, the SCT screen shows an acceptable sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the HemosIL SCT assay including the confirmation step, has a much lower sensitivity in the diagnosis of LAC in comparison with the Staclot-LA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combining the HemosIL SCT assay with dRVVT results in a better sensitivity, although lower than the combined aPTT/dRVVT based method as usually performed in our lab </plain></SENT>
