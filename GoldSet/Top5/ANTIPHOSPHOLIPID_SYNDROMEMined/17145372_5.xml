<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, laboratory, and serologic features of the association of the two diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from 56 patients having both SS and SLE were analyzed, with special emphasis on their clinical, laboratory, and serologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from 50 patients with SLE and 50 patients with SS served as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age in SS-SLE group was lower than in patients with SS but higher than patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When SLE and SS were associated, presence of rheumatoid factor was less frequent, whereas anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B, antinuclear, anti-DNA, and antiphospholipid autoantibodies appeared more often </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SS-SLE patients, pulmonary, renal, skin, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, and serositis occurred more often than in patients with SS alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>Thyroiditis</z:hpo>, autoantibodies to Ro/SS-A, La/SS-B and ds-DNA was more frequent in the SS-SLE group than in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic background of the patients did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, characteristic clinical, laboratory and serologic features distinguish between the association of SS and SLE and the primary forms of these two diseases </plain></SENT>
