<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS has been shown to be frequently accompanied by multiple and recurrent cerebral ischemic lesions, suggesting that APS may play a critical role in developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a case with an unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> accompanied by a severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery as a manifestation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully treated surgically employing the following precaution to prevent potential damage on the fragile ischemic brain: preoperative administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi>, intermittent brain retraction, intraoperative SEP monitoring, and postoperative administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> accompanied by APS could be safely treated by strict paraoperative management </plain></SENT>
