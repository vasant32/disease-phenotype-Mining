<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected patients commonly develop antibodies that recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complexes that may form on the surface of activated platelets and on the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been established that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> antibodies are responsible for the clinical manifestations of HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we employed a recently developed model of active immunity to study the effect of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> antibody in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In previous studies we have shown that it is possible to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in naive mice by active immunization with anti-DNA, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunized animals develop anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) and, after 2-4 months, anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ab3s generated in this manner often simulate the binding activity of Ab1 and their expression correlates with the development of specific clinical manifestations typical of the respective human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on this experience, naive BALB/c mice were immunized with IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> antibodies isolated from two patients with HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actively immunized mice developed mouse anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> antibody (Ab3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, but not low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), to the actively immunized animals induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> by day 4 of drug exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support the importance of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> antibodies in the pathogenesis of HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further, this model may help to elucidate the factors responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as well as providing means to assess new treatment options for patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
