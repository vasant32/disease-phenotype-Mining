<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the relative risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 articles that examined the association between aPL and VT in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Mostly secondary and tertiary referral centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 2249 patients with SLE, 1120 tested for LA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) and 1563 tested for aCL (anticardiolipin antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A summary of study characteristics and a critical appraisal of study quality were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two statistical combinations of 18 primary studies that examined the association of VT and LA and of 14 studies that examined the association of VT and aCL were performed to estimate the risk for VT associated with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The odds ratios of the risk of VT related to the LA summarized from 18 studies were 5.61 [95% CI; 3.80-8.27] overall, 6.32 [CI; 3.71-10.78] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, 11.6 [3.65-36.91] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after the first event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios of the risk of VT related to aCL summarized from 14 studies were 2.17 [95% CI; 1.51-3.11] overall, 2.50 [CI; 1.51-4.14] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, 3.91 [1.14-13.38] for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> after the first event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE and LA are at approximately six times greater risk for VT than patients without LA, whereas patients with SLE and aCL are approximately two times greater risk for VT than patients without aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have identified important methodologic limitations and differences in study characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for VT have not been thoroughly evaluated in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed that provide an accurate estimate of the absolute risk for aPL related VT </plain></SENT>
