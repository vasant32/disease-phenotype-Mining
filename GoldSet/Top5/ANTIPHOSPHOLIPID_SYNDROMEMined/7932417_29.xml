<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine prognostic factors for mortality in a cohort of 667 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) including those variables associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of the cohort under a nested case control design by means of Cox proportional hazards regression with and without stepwise method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 2039 person-years of followup, there were 49 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> were the aPL related manifestations that were associated with decreased survival in univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first 2 were also selected among risk factors for mortality in stepwise Cox multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The syndrome itself was also associated with increased mortality rates, independently of other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS is among the variables that confer decreased survival on patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This decreased survival is due to some (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>), but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of the manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
