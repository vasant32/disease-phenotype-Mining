<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They usually involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543878" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choreatic disorders</z:e> such as Sydenham <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 48-year-old woman was initially seen with a 1-year history of progressive changes in personality and attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were minor associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative routine investigation results, including regular autoimmune serologies and magnetic resonance imaging, led to the diagnosis of a frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic results demonstrated hypermetabolism in the left striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot technique results demonstrated plasma antistriatal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> induced a resolution of her attentional deficits and a return of her personality to its premorbid state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The repeated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scan results were near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the titer of antistriatal antibodies was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Autoimmune striatal dysfunction can initially appear with a clinical picture suggestive of a degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the underlying etiology and treatment was possible because of abnormalities uncovered on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic images </plain></SENT>
