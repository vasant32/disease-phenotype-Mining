<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One of the described mechanisms leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is overexpression of tissue factor (TF) in the monocytes and endothelial cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may stimulate monocyte TF expression through its receptor, the tyrosine kinase Flt-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the following in monocytes of 55 primary APS patients: VEGF and Flt-1 expression levels, their potential regulation by aPL, and the association of VEGF and Flt-1 expression with the increased TF expression found in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Purified monocytes from APS patients showed higher levels of VEGF and Flt-1 than healthy donors, which further correlated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) anticardiolipin titers and TF expression rank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, monocyte VEGF and Flt-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with than in patients without previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IgG from APS patients increased monocyte VEGF and Flt-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEGF and Flt-1 expression was significantly inhibited by the p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580; this suggests the involvement of this kinase in the aPL-induced VEGF and Flt-1 upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, for the first time in vivo, that monocytes from primary APS patients have an increased expression of VEGF and Flt-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro results indicated that this cytokine is produced by monocytes when treated with aPL, and that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, VEGF might act as a regulatory factor in aPL-mediated monocyte activation and TF expression, thereby contributing to the proinflammatory-prothrombotic phenotype of APS patients </plain></SENT>
