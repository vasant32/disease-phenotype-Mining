<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was investigated in the present study where a total of 385 women aged &lt;/=40 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 175 were experimental subjects and 210 were controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former comprised the following two study groups: 100 spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> (group one), and 75 patients with repeated failure of embryo transfer (group two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls included three groups of women: 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy parous women with no previous abortion (group three), 60 <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> patients achieving a live birth with their first in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/embryo transfer attempt (group four), and 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> who tested positive for aPL (LA and/or aCL) (positive controls, group five) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> (group one) tested positive for abeta(2)GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women in groups two, three and four were negative for abeta(2)GP-I screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, prevalence of patients testing positive for abeta(2)GP-I was significantly higher in group five than among the other groups of patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed regarding the prevalence of abeta(2)GP-I positive sera in the subgroup of patients having aCL and those having the LA in group five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that abeta(2)GP-I screening in first-trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> or in <z:mp ids='MP_0001728'>failure of implantation</z:mp> after IVF is not warranted in patients without aPL as detected by standard antiphospholipid assays </plain></SENT>
