<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They interfere with the anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> of the cellular membranous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are frequently associated to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, especially the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), they expose the patient to thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to define the possible and prognostic predictive value of these aCL, a sequential research of these antibodies was performed on 12 patients suffering from SLE since 2 to 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An average of one sample per year was drawn, either during an attack or in a routine control check </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection of these IgG aCL did not appear to be related with be course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, 3 of our patients, ill since respectively 2, 7 and 11 years, never showed any aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These aCL were positive during an attack in 80% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This positivity was associated to vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (2 cases), and cutaneous vascularity (6 cases) and, in one case, the presence of aCL was linked to inutero fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to retruplacentary <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the association between aCL and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
