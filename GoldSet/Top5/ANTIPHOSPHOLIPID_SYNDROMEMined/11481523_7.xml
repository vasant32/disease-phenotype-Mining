<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 75-year-old man had erythematous and violaceous macules, some stellate and others arranged in a livedoid pattern, evolving toward <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with central areas having an "atrophie blanche" appearance spread on the trunk, inguinal folds, and right thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was on hemodialysis and had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026470" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">benign monoclonal gammopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous biopsy revealed RAE characterized by the proliferation of epithelioid and spindle-shaped cells in superficial and middermis lining vascular channels, arranged in clusters, and sometimes displaying an intravascular growth pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells stained for CD31, CD34, and actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, prominent amyloid deposits were found in the wall of some vessels in deep dermis, often causing obstruction of their lumina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause of RAE is unknown, but it can be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysglobulinemia</z:e>, cryoproteinemia, and lower extremities <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, and it may occur near <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this patient, we believe that RAE was caused by obliteration of dermal vessels by amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it is thought that RAE could be caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported patient with RAE associated with amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
