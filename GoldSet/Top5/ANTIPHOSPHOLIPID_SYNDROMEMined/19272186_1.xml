<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of anti-B19-VP1u antibody in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To elucidate the effect of anti-B19-VP1u antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), passive transfer of rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG was injected intravenously into NZB/W F1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant reduction of platelet count and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> time were detected in anti-B19-VP1u IgG group as compared to other groups, whereas significant increases of anti-B19-VP1u, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (APhL), and anti-double strand DNA (dsDNA) antibody binding activity were detected in anti-B19-VP1u group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, significant increases of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) activity and protein expression were detected in B19-VP1u IgG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26034">phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate</z:chebi> kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins were involved in the induction of MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These experimental results firstly demonstrated the aggravated effects of anti-B19-VP1u antibody in disease activity of SLE </plain></SENT>
