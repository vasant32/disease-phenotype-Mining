<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of patients with SLE were studied: (a) SLE/APS (n = 56): 51 female, mean (SD) age 46 (11) years, fulfilling 1999 Sapporo criteria for the APS; (b) SLE/<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 56): 53 female, age 42.6 (12) years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and persistently negative for aCL and/or LA; (c) SLE only (n = 56): 53 female, age 40 (11) years, without a history of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL and LA were retested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested for anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta(2)GPI) and antiprothrombin antibodies (aPT) by coating prothrombin on irradiated plates or using phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex as the antigen (aPS-PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-beta(2)GPI were only present in patients from the SLE/APS group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were also positive for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aPT and aPS-PT were also more commonly found in SLE/APS than in SLE/<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or SLE only groups (54% v 5%, p&lt;0.0001 or v 16%, p&lt;0.0001 for aPT and 63% v 2%, p&lt;0.0001 or v 11%, p&lt;0.0001 for aPS-PT, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between SLE/<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and SLE only groups (p = 1.5 for beta(2)GPI, p = 0.1 for aPT, and p = 0.1 for aPS-PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Testing for aPT in patients with SLE with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but persistently negative for aCL and LA, may be helpful in some selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI are not present in patients who are negative for aCL </plain></SENT>
