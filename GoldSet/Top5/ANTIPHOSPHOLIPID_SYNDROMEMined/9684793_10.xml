<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recommended therapeutic range of International Normalized Ratio (INR) for oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a part of this controversy, it has been suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) could interfere with the determination of prothrombin time, thus questioning the validity of monitoring the treatment of these patients using INR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this point, we compared the values of INR obtained in the plasmas of two groups of patients, one without LA (n = 47), and the other with LA (n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INR were determined using 8 different thromboplastin reagents on the same automated coagulation instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromogenic factor X, which is supposed to be insensitive to the presence of LA, was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are the following: provided INR was calculated using calibrated reference plasmas, there was no significant difference between INR values obtained with the 8 reagents, both in the non-LA and in the LA groups (CV: 5.9 and 6.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Closer examination revealed that INR results obtained with one reagent (the recombinant thromboplastin Innovin) diverged from those of the 7 others, leading to an overestimation of INR, to a very large extent in some instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However this effect was restricted to a subset of the patient population with LA (6 out of 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, the relationship between INR (average value obtained using the 8 reagents) and factor X was identical in non-LA and in LA patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, provided the reagents which display the LA interference are identified and excluded for this purpose, the INR system is valid for monitoring oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in patients with LA </plain></SENT>
