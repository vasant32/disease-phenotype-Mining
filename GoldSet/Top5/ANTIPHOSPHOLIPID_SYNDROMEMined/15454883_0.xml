<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>abeta(2)-GPI and aCL concentrations were assessed in 70 patients with APS and compared with those in 65 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) without clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In APS patients (38 with APS I, 32 with APS II), the diagnosis had to have been made at least 3 years earlier; in subjects with SLE, the diagnosis had to have been made at least 5 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> serum samples were tested for abeta(2) -GPI with the use of an in-house ELISA with an abeta(2) -GPI preparation from human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples negative for abeta(2) -GPI were controlled with 2 additional beta(2)-GPI preparations, 1 from human serum and 1 from bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In APS, abeta(2)-GPIs were more frequent than in SLE (76% and 15%, respectively; P &lt;.0001), mainly with IgG isotype and with significantly higher levels than those found in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity for APS was 92% for IgG abeta(2)-GPIs and 68% for IgG aCLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest association with APS was found for the combination of the 2 markers (odds ratio 29; 95% confidence interval 10-76; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the APS patients, 6 were positive for aCL only and remained negative regardless of which beta 2 -GPI preparation was used; 1 patient was aCL-negative and only positive with human beta 2 -GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the APS immunologic profile and the diagnostic possibilities of both antibodies </plain></SENT>
