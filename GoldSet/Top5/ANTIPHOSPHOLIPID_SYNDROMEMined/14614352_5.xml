<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite reliable pharmacokinetics of LMWH, current practice is that anti-activated factor X levels are monitored in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the use of unmonitored dalteparin in 27 pregnancies of 25 women who had previous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function and weighed less than 85 kg prior to conceiving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regimen consisted of 5000 IU dalteparin once daily started at the time of a positive pregnancy test, and increased to twice daily at 16-20 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of patients there was a low complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the women developed recurrent venous thromboses during these pregnancies but two women with known cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> developed recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, which responded to an increase in dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our small group of patients, we have found that the use of intermediate-dose LMWH in pregnant women does not need to be monitored, and that it is safe and probably effective in preventing recurrent venous but not arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">high-risk pregnancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
