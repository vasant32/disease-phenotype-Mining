<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to evaluate the in vitro effects on platelet activation of anti-β2 glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodiesisolated from APS patientin either quiescent or catastrophic phase and to investigate ex vivo platelet and endothelial activation in patients with quiescent or catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-β2GPI antibodies were isolated from plasma of a pregnant woman in two different stages of APS (quiescent and catastrophic, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were co-incubated with washed platelets from healthy controls that were then challenged with TRAP-6 (thrombin receptor activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 6) and the expression of P- selectin (P-sel) on platelets was assessed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plasma samples from six patients with quiescent, four with catastrophic APS and 10 controls were assessed for several markers of platelet and endothelial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that purified anti-β2GPI antibodies co-incubated with platelets enhanced TRAP-6- induced platelet P-sel expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, anti-β2GPI antibodies isolated during the catastrophic phase enhanced platelet P-sel expression more than antibodies isolated from the same patient in the quiescent stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, APS patients had significantly higher plasma levels of soluble (s) Psel, sCD40 ligand, soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, sP-sel and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor activity were significantly higher during catastrophic than in quiescent phase </plain></SENT>
