<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the autoantigen targets of 75 human sera that had antibodies to the nuclear envelope (NE) as identified by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several different IIF staining patterns could be identified when antibodies to different components of the nuclear membrane (NM) and nuclear pore complexes (NuPC) were identified: a smooth membrane pattern characteristic of antibodies to nuclear lamins, a punctate pattern typical of antibodies to the nuclear pore complex and more complex patterns that included antibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblotting of isolated nuclear and NE proteins and immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled recombinant proteins prepared by using the full-length cDNAs of the Translocated promoter region (Tpr), gp210 and p62 were used to identify specific autoantibody targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two of the 75 (70%) sera bound to Tpr, 25 (33%) bound to lamins A, B or C, 15 (20%) reacted with gp210 and none reacted with p62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (21%) did not react with any of the NE components tested in our assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of 37 patients with anti-NE showed that there were 34 females and three males with an age range of 16-88 years (mean 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical diagnosis (9/37 = 24%) was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ALD</z:e>; two with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>), followed by seven (19%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), four (11%) with a motor and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000763'>sensory neuropathy</z:hpo>, three (8%) with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), two with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SjS), and others with a variety of diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report indicates that Tpr, a component of the NuPC, is a common target of human autoantibodies that react with the NE </plain></SENT>
