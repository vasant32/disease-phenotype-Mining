<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have been done in the African American population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from 100 African American patients with SLE were tested for IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computerized clinical data on these patients were reviewed with a specific focus on clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positivity for at least one isotype of aCL antibodies was found in 33% of the patients, whereas 28% were positive for at least one isotype of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgA was the most prevalent isotype for both antibodies; 24% of the patients in the aCL ELISA and 19% in the anti-beta2-GPI ELISA were positive for IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positivity for both aCL and anti-beta2-GPI in the same patient was seen more frequently with the IgA isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fewer than half of the patients positive for aCL antibodies had medium-to-high levels of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A few patients had presented thrombotic manifestations, and these patients were positive for aCL (P = 0.01) and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No other manifestations of APS could be significantly correlated with the presence of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that IgA is the most prevalent isotype among the African American patients with SLE studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The predominance of the IgA isotype and the low prevalence of medium-to-high levels of aCL antibodies may account for the low frequency of clinical manifestations of APS in these patients </plain></SENT>
