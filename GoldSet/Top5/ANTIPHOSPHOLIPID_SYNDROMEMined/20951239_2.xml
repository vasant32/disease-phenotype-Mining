<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross sectional study of PAPS patients from the outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MetS was based on three international definitions: World Health Organization (WHO), Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III), or International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation (IDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical history and laboratory investigations, including insulin levels, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and CRP, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kappa statistics examined the agreement between MetS definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 58 PAPS patients were studied, mean age 42.14Â±11.62, 9 men, 49 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels, and visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of MetS was 17.2% according to WHO, 34.5% according to ATP III and 37.9% according to IDF criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MetS according to ATP III and WHO criteria was similar to the general population (34.5% vs. 36.8%) (17.2% vs. 13.6%), and lower according to IDF definition (37.9% vs. 49.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high prevalence of MetS in PAPS patients, similar to that in the general population and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of MetS is very important to indicate preventive strategies and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality in PAPS </plain></SENT>
