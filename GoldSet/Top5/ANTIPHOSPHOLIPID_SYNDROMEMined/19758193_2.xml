<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to determine a Val/Leu SNP at position 247 of the beta2-GPI gene in Brazilian patients with APS and to compare these data with clinical and laboratory manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism assignment was performed by PCR followed by Rsa I restriction endonuclease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The titration of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies was detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed significantly higher frequencies of the V-encoding allele and the homozygous VV genotype in patients with APS than in control subjects (OR = 1.781, P = 0.0068; and OR = 6.413, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this genotype was also significantly higher in patients with arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> than in the control group (52% and 44%, respectively, versus 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI-positive patients had significantly higher frequencies of the VV genotype than the controls subjects (OR = 8.179, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the V-encoding allele and the homozygous VV genotype at position 247 of the beta2-GPI gene may play a role in the generation of anomalous beta2-GPI, with consequent auto-antibody production, and in phenotype expression of arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in APS patients </plain></SENT>
