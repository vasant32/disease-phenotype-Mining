<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with APS or aPLs, 33 healthy people (HP), 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) underwent pulse wave analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data calculated included the small artery elasticity (SAE), large artery elasticity (LAE) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient group was divided into two subgroups: APS-1 with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment, and APS-2 without <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and healthy subjects were matched by gender, body mass index and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in APS-1 group were significantly younger in comparison to three other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the adjustment for age, we found that SAE in APS-1 group did not differ from SAE in the HP group (6.4+/-1.8 ml/mmHg x 100 and 5.54+/-3.4 ml/mmHg x 100, respectively, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SAE in the group APS-2 was significantly lower (3.41+/-1.2 ml/mmHg x 100) than in the APS-1 and was almost equal to SAE in the DM group (4.2+/-2.37 ml/mmHg x 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SAE in the APS-2, DM and HP groups was inversely correlated with age, whereas in the APS-1 group we did not find such correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This pilot study showed abnormal small vascular elasticity in the patients with positive aPL, relative to the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The APS patients, treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> had the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This data support the hypothesis that APS may be associated with diffuse changes in the arterial wall, and may be a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
