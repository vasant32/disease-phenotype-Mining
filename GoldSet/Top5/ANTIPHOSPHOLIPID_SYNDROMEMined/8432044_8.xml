<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three monoclonal antibodies that differentiate between CL or PS were tested against resting and thrombin-activated platelets by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each antibody reacted differently with CL and PS; 3SB9b reacted with PS, D11A4 reacted with CL, and BA3B5C4 reacted with both CL and PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated platelets bound BA3B5C4 and 3SB9b, but not D11A4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BA3B5C4-reactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> appeared earlier during activation than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> reactive with 3SB9b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that antibodies against PS are reactive with activated platelets and that two immunoreactive forms of PS are sequentially expressed on platelets during activation </plain></SENT>
