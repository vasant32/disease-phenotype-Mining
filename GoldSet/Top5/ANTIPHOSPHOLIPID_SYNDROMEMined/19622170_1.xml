<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic factors might play an important role in this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annexin V (ANV) is a calcium-dependent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> widely present in various tissues exerting a potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect in vitro by reducing plaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-annexin V antibodies (aANVAs) are detected in various diseases like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study of ANV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) might shed light on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> mechanisms in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the association of plasma ANV, aANVAs and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCLAs) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study recruited 45 patients with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> according to WHO criteria in their first 24 hours of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>36 matched individuals were studied as the control group with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of ANV, aANVAs and aCLAs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma ANV levels in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> on admission were significantly lower than those in the control group (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive test for aANVAs were found to be present in a significant number of our patients (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The studied groups were similar in their rate of patients with positive aCLAs tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ANV, aANVAs and aCLAs were not correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, sex, age and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that low plasma ANV levels along with positive aANVAs tests in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> are indicative of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> that is not related to the traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
