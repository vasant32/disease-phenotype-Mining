<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) specific for autoantibodies against beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) or prothrombin are also used, but none of the tests are adequately sensitive or specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chromogenic assay was developed that measures the effect of test antibody or plasma samples on in vitro thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is able to detect both LA and beta(2)GPI-dependent aCL antibodies and may have greater specificity for APS than currently available tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this method various monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were examined, from mice immunized with beta(2)GPI, mice with a spontaneous animal model of APS, and from three humans with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma and affinity purified antibodies from patients with APS and control groups were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin inhibition was more sensitive to perturbation by MoAbs than a combination of tests for LA (P &lt; 0.05) and at lower antibody concentrations (12.5 microg/ml versus 100 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between inhibition of thrombin generation and the level of MoAb reactivity to beta(2)GPI (r = 0.90; P &lt; 0.001) but not to CL (r = 0.06; P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma and affinity purified antibodies from patients with APS also inhibited thrombin generation, and significantly more so than patients with aPL from causes other than APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>APS patient samples showed thrombin inhibition in the presence of anti-beta(2)GPI or antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MoAbs binding beta(2)GPI showed inhibition of thrombin generation, while MoAbs binding domain I of beta(2)GPI had more LA effect </plain></SENT>
