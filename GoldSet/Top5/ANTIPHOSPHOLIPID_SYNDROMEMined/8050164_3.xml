<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ACA were purified from the sera of patients with MG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the IgG-ACA was found to be monospecific with high affinity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, and to carry a pathogenic ACA Id (1.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active immunization of naive BALB/c mice with the purified IgG-ACA was followed by production in the mice of sustained high titres of ACA, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (APTT) (61 +/- 14s versus 31 +/- 2s in control mice; P &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (468,000 +/- 224,000/mm3 versus 994,000 +/- 92,000/mm3 in controls; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The titres of other autoantibodies (e.g. anti-DNA, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi>), although being high after immunization, decreased rapidly and were undetected after 1 month following the boost injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice immunized with the IgG-ACA exhibited low fecundity (36% of mice became pregnant versus 62% observed in the group immunized with control IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pregnant mice had increased resorption rate (the equivalent of fetal loss in the human) of 52 +/- 8% (versus 5 +/- 4% in the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (+/- s.d.) embryo and placental weights in mice with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APLS) were significantly lower compared with the mice injected with control IgG (682 +/- 304 mg and 102 +/- 12 mg versus 1303 +/- 105 mg and 145 +/- 8 mg, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum monoclonal immunoglobulins having autoantibody activity may be regarded as an expansion of clones producing natural autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the pathogenic role of natural ACA in the pathogenesis of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
