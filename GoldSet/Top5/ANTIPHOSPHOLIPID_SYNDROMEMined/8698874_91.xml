<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The optimal clinical management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) is uncertain because of a lack of an underlying hypothesis to explain why antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPL) form to such ubiquitous compounds as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we demonstrate that many, if not most, aPL are actually directed at neoepitopes of oxidized PL, or neoepitopes generated by adduct formation between breakdown products of oxidized PL and associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) molecule contains four <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and is highly susceptible to oxidation, particularly upon exposure to air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yet, standard anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) immunoassays routinely bind CL to microtiter wells by evaporation of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> solvent overnight at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a variety of techniques, we demonstrated that rapid oxidation occurs when CL is plated and exposed to air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from apo E-deficient mice, which have high autoantibody titers to oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, showed a striking time-dependent increase in binding to CL that was exposed to air for increasing periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies to oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, cloned from the apo E-deficient mice, also bound to oxidized CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both sera and affinity-purified aCL-IgG from APS patients bound to CL progressively as it was oxidized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the monoclonal antibodies from apo E-deficient mice, or sera or aCL-IgG from APS patients did not bind to a reduced CL analog that was unable to undergo peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that many aPL are directed at neoepitopes of oxidized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, and suggest that oxidative events may be important in the pathophysiology of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In turn, this suggests new therapeutic strategies, possibly including intensive <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
