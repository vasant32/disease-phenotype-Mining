<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) who suffer relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the Web site--based international registry of patients with catastrophic APS ("CAPS Registry") http://infmed.fcrb.es/es/web/caps and selected those cases that relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relapses were reported in 9 of 282 (3.2%) patients with catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 episodes of catastrophic APS were found: 6 patients presented 2 relapses, 2 patients suffered 3 relapses, and 1 patient developed 17 relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the last patient was not included in the statistical analysis because his clinical and immunologic characteristics were not fully described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a total of 18 episodes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 (50%) episodes, a precipitating factor was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent precipitating factor, found in 5 (28%) episodes, was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain, kidney, heart, and lung were the most common organs involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laboratory features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001937'>microangiopathic hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (MHA) were present in 13 of 18 (72%) episodes (definitive in 9, corresponding to 4 patients, and probable in 4, corresponding to 2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three relapses did not present with features of MHA and in the remaining 2 these data were not reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although relapses are rare in patients with catastrophic APS, these results support the hypothesis that an association between MHA and relapsing of catastrophic APS could be present </plain></SENT>
