<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI), the key antigen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, is susceptible to oxidative modifications by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> (*OH) that may influence its <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-binding and antigenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects on human and bovine beta2GPI of *OH free radicals generated by gamma-radiolysis of water with 137Cs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiolytic *OH caused a dose-dependent loss of tryptophan, production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50607">dityrosine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23019">carbonyl groups</z:chebi>. dimerization and/or extensive aggregation of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It ensued a reduction in affinity binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> liposomes and loss of beta2GPI-dependent autoantibody binding to immobilized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient anti-beta2GPI antibodies (n = 20) segregated into two groups based on the effect in the beta2GPI-ELISA of beta2GPI pretreatment with *OH: enhancement (group A, n = 10) or suppression (group B, n = 10) of IgG binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The avidities of group A antibodies for fluid-phase beta2GPI were low but increased in a dose-dependent manner upon beta2GPI irradiation, in relation to protein crosslinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing features of group B antibodies included higher avidities for fluid-phase beta2GPI that was no longer recognized after *OH treatment, and negative anticardiolipin tests suggesting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> location near the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The *OH scavengers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36946">thiourea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> efficiently protected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> above changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, oxidative modifications of beta2GPI via *OH attack of susceptible amino acids alter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding, and modulate recognition by autoantibodies depending on their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may be of clinical relevance for the generation and/or reactivity of anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
