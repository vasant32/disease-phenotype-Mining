<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the distribution of beta 2 GPI in these patients, we developed a method for measurement of free beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with SLE, of whom 18 had laboratory evidence of aPAs, and 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma was filtered by centrifugation at 650 x g through a 100 kDa filter in order to allow separation of free and complexed beta 2 GPI, and beta 2 GPI levels were measured in the starting plasma and filtrate by a standardized ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total beta 2 GPI levels of the SLE aPA positive patients (253.3 mg/l) were significantly increased compared with the SLE aPA negative patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (188.0, P &lt; 0.001 and 194.9 mg/l, P &lt; 0.01, respectively), but there were no significant differences between free beta 2 GPI levels of these groups (20.8, 24.0 and 20.5 mg/l, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that levels of complexed beta 2 GPI are increased in patients with aPAs, perhaps as a result of immune complex formation, or altered binding to other plasma constituents </plain></SENT>
