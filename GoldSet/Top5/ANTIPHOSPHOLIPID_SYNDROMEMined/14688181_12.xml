<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> due to uteroplacental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is considered to be one of the causes of pregnancy loss, microparticles may be associated with pregnancy loss, in addition to, or as part of, other procoagulant states such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of circulating microparticles in women with recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 96 women with recurrent pregnancy losses were enrolled in a case-control study and compared with 90 parous women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microparticles were measured by flow cytometry using fluorescent anti-CD51/CD31 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microparticle levels &gt;2 SD above the mean of controls (57,700/ml) were detected in 12 out of 96 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> (12.5%), compared with two of the 90 control women (2.2%), P&lt;0.008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The titre of microparticles did not correlate with age, number of pregnancy losses, primary secondary or tertiary aborters status, or with pregnancy losses in the 1st or 2nd trimesters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of women with pregnancy loss have elevated endothelial microparticles suggesting that endothelial damage or activation might be associated with the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
