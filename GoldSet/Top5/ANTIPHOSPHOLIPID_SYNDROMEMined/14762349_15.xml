<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Heart valve abnormalities are commonly found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> but experience with valve replacement in such patients is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the results of valve replacement in patients with this condition at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1989 and 2002, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (8 women, 2 men; aged 38-73 years, mean 49 years) with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> (n = 7), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> (n = 2), or combined mitral-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> (n = 1) underwent valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed retrospectively their clinical data, operative and postoperative courses, and the long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological reassessment was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedures performed included mitral valve replacement in 7 patients, aortic valve replacement in 2 patients, and combined aortic valve replacement plus mitral valve replacement in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 2 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immediate mortality was 20% (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 2 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up period of up to 8 years, 2 patients required repeat operation for valve-related complications (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional patient died of cardiac causes 13 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> 3 and 10 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The late outcome was uneventful in only 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Valve replacement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> may carry significant early and late mortality and morbidity, particularly when such patients are referred with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
