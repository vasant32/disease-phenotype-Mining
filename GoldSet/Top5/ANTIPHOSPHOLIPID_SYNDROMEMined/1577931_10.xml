<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventeen women with recurrent fetal loss associated with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody were treated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin (PSL/ASP) therapy from the early gestational period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The success rate of pregnancy in the treated patients was significantly higher than that in 12 untreated patients of similar background, including age, number of previous fetal losses and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> titre (76.5 versus 8.3%, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> evident in previous pregnancies was also improved by the therapy, suggesting that PSL/ASP itself has a beneficial effect against placental damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These clinical improvements were accompanied by a reduction in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody titre, especially that of anti-phosphatidylserine antibody (anti-PS), to within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range within 8 weeks after PSL/ASP administration in most of the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction of antibody titre in the untreated patients during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that PSL/ASP therapy, when started in the early gestational period (prior to 8 weeks gestation), was effective for the achievement of successful pregnancy and the prevention of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and that the anti-PS titre was a good clinical marker for evaluating the effect of PSL/ASP therapy </plain></SENT>
