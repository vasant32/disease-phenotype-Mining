<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL) antibodies on the clinical features of 42 patients with PAPS (mean age 40.45+/-13.37; 32 women and 10 men), and to compare them with 47 control subjects (mean age 39.68+/-13.93; 33 women and 14 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentrations were determined by enzymatic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was calculated according to the Friedwald formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin, anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and anti-Beta2glycoprotein I antibodies were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association was found between arterial events and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and cholesterol concentrations, but multivariate analysis showed that cholesterol concentrations were the most important predictor of arterial events (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular insults were the most significantly associated with cholesterol concentrations (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> were more frequently present in patients more than 40 years of age (p=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association of the investigated parameters with venous thromboses was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent abortions</z:e> were not associated with the presence or concentrations of the investigated parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although patients had increased concentrations of anti-oxLDL antibodies, no significant association was found between the titres of anti-oxLDL antibodies and clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with PAPS, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations are a better predictor for arterial events than anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
