<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two matched reference groups with no antecedent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> were studied: 100 healthy mothers and 50 childless women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the prospective part of the study, we found 9.4% of the patients (95% C.I.: 6.8-12%) with an isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004841'>factor XII deficiency</z:hpo>, 7.4% of the patients (5.0-9.8%) with primary antiphopholipid antibodies, 47% of the patients (42.6-51.4%) with an insufficient response to the venous occlusion test and an isolated hypofibrinolysis was found in 42.6% (38.2-47%) of the patients (reference groups: respectively 0/150, 3/150, 2/150, p &lt; 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Willebrand disease, fibrinogen, deficiency, antithrombin, protein C or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> were not more frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> than in members of the reference groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the retrospective part of the study, cases of plasma resistance to activated protein C were not abnormally frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had higher Willebrand factor antigen (vWF), tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI) and D-dimers (D-Di) than the reference women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Values of vWF, t-PA, PAI and D-Di were altogether correlated but were not related to C-reactive protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients, those with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and those with an insufficient response to the venous occlusion test had higher vWF, t-PA, PAI and D-Di values than the patients with none of the haemostasis-related abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004841'>factor XII deficiency</z:hpo> and hypofibrinolysis (mainly high PAI) are the most frequent haemostasis-related abnormalities found in unexplained primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or hypofibrinolysis, there is a non-inflammatory ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> elevation of markers of endothelial stimulation associated with coagulation activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This should allow to define subgroups of patients for future therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
