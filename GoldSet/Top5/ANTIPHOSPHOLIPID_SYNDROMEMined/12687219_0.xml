<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>High-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell (SC) transplantation has been recently proposed as a new strategy for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rationale for using stem cell transplantation to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> is based on the principle of complete ablation of an aberrant immune system followed by reconstitution of a new immune system deriving from graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different approaches are being currently used: 1) allogeneic SC transplantation, 2) autologous SC rescue following "immunoablation", and 3) intensive immunosuppression alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By October 2000, a total of 310 patients who received SC transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were registered in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation/European League Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients with primary severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (4 female and 1 male) were enrolled in our Institute from 1998 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transplantations were made for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE, n = 4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three SLE patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, lung <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, secondary antiphospholipide syndrome, 1 SLE patient had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, patient with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> had a relapse after splenectomy and had unresponsive severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow up is now 24 months for 1 SLE patient (she is in complete remission), 12 months for the 2nd SLE patient (partial response), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patient is well at present, platelets &gt;100 x 10(9), dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> is 10 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 SLE patients died on day +11 and +19 due to transplant-associated complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study is still ongoing and longer follow-up is necessary to assess long-term efficacy of this treatment approach </plain></SENT>
