<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune causes have been suggested as a factor in some of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High rates of intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found in previous studies that sera from SLE/APS patients when used as a culture medium for rat embryos were found to reduce embryonic growth and development, induce a high rate of embryonic anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and damage the yolk sac morphologically and functionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the direct effect of IgG purified from women with SLE/APS on the growth and viability of embryos, we cultured 11.5-day-old rat embryos in their yolk sacs in the presence of IgG purified from SLE/APS patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG affected directly the embryo and yolk sac, reducing their growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purified IgG positive for anticardiolipin/anti-DNA antibodies reduced yolk sac and embryonic growth more than sera negative for these antibodies but positive for antiphosphatydilserine and for antilaminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antiphosphatydilserine reduced yolk sac growth but the embryos remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following the observed damage to the yolk sac we cultured human placental explants at 5.5-8 weeks of pregnancy in sera from SLE/APS patients for 96 hours and found that these sera reduced placental trophoblastic cell growth, reduced their proliferation rate and increased their rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment of the women resulted in a correction of the damage induced in the cultured rat embryos and in the cultured placental explants </plain></SENT>
