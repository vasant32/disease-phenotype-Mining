<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine microcirculation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) showing clinical signs which may deteriorate hemodynamic indices: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Microcirculatory changes were studied in 63 patients with SLE using biomicroscopy of bulbar conjunctival vessels (Zeiss slit-lamp, 32 times magnification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following conjunctival indices were estimated: general (GCI), vascular (VCI), intravascular (IVCI), extravascular or perivascular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microcirculatory changes in SLE patients covered disturbances of microvascular architectonics, microvascular blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VCI, IVCI, GCI were significantly higher than in control subjects: 6.16 +/- 0.31, 3.69 +/- 0.36 and 9.87 +/- 0.57 scores vs 3.20 +/- 0.50; 120 +/- 0.20 and 4.20 +/- 0.50 scores, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of structural changes in the vessels depended on the disease duration while intravascular changes depended on the activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with AH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> microcirculatory disturbances were similar and related to vascular architectonics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In APS there were marked intravascular disorders (IVCI was 7.50 +/- 0.59 scores, GCI was 16.13 +/- 1.41 scores) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In SLE patients with AH and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> microcirculatory changes involved primarily structure of the vascular wall and may be brought about by compensatory-adaptive mechanisms of the microcirculatory bed in high hemodynamic load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravascular microcirculatory changes were most pronounced, first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> as sludge-phenomenon, in APS and high SLE activity </plain></SENT>
