<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Non-organ-specific autoantibodies are present in centenarians without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> but conflicting or no data on anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding proteins were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and antigen specificity of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding proteins in centenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven centenarians, 70 adult controls, 65 unselected elderly subjects, and 38 old SENIEUR volunteers were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, anti-human beta 2 glycoprotein I, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antigen specificity was assayed against plates coated with anionic, neutral and cationic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and beta 2 glycoprotein I-dependence was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 54.3% of the centenarians were positive for IgG and 8.6% for IgM anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibodies, while only 20.7% centenarians were positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> IgG and 2.59% for IgM; none resulted positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> positive sera cross-reacted with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and displayed decreased binding to serum-free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-coated plates that was restored by human beta 2 glycoprotein I or fetal calf serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Centenarians display high reactivity against human beta 2 glycoprotein I but low binding to the bovine molecule in the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In spite of the presence of antibodies comparable to those found in patients with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, no vascular events were reported suggesting the presence of unknown protective factors and/or the lack of triggering factors </plain></SENT>
