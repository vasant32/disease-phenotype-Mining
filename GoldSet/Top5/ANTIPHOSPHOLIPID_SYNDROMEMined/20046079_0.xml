<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the usefulness of addition of <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> clotting time (SCT) to the pre-existing dilute Russell's viper venom test (dRVVT) for detection of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, we analyzed differences in the thrombotic features and the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> between dRVVT and SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 167 patients positive for LA or anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (anti-CL) antibody and 76 healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dRVVT and SCT were used for detection of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-CL, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2 GPI) and anti-prothrombin (anti-PT) antibodies were measured using commercial ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the sensitivity of the combined test of SCT and dRVVT was 56.4%, which was higher than that of dRVVT alone (46.2%) or SCT alone (23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the combined test (80.9%) was comparable to that of dRVVT (81.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, odds ratio for predicting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was higher in the combined test than in dRVVT or SCT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When normalized LA ratio of the two tests was compared, the group of patients with higher ratio of SCT showed significantly higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> and higher positivity of IgG types of anti-CL, anti-beta2 GPI and anti-PT than the group with higher ratio of dRVVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of SCT to dRVVT can improve the detection sensitivity of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in LA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And the high normalized LA ratio of SCT may be a useful parameter for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
