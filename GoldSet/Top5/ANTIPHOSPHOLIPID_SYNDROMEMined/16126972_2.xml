<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 60 pAPS patients followed up at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of mono-organic involvement was considered when one organ was affected exclusively, and multi-organic involvement was considered when two or more organs became affected during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average age at diagnosis was 32.9 +/- 12.4 years, 40 subjects were female and 20 male, and mean disease evolution totaled 11.5 +/- 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of clinical events was 3.75 +/- 1.87 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients, immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin (IgM aCL) titers totaled 50 +/- 40.3 IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units, and IgM aCL titers totaled 47.3 +/- 35.4 IgM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical manifestations at study <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, fetal loss, and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of follow-up, 46 patients had mono-organic involvement and 14 had multi-organic involvement (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, at the end of the study, only 8 patients still had mono-organic involvement, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 3), and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 2) (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the probability of remaining with mono-organic involvement decreased throughout the cumulative years, especially during the first 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hazard risk ratio for developing multi-organic involvement was 1.47 patients per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PAPS is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorder with unpredictable clinical course and multi-organic involvement, especially during the first years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The conversion to multi-organic involvement supports the concept that pAPS is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
