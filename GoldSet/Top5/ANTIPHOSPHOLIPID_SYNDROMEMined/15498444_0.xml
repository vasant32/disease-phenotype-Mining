<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: We describe 112 patients with APS, 50 primary (PAPS) and 62 secondary (SAPS) -56 (90%) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)-, monitorized in two referral centers in Malaga (Spain) from 1989 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were obtained from the medical records by means of a protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age was similar in both groups (42.3 [14.7] years for the whole series) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with SAPS had an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease (29.6 [12.6] years, vs 37.0 [13.9] years in PAPS) and they had a longer evolution of the disease (143.3 [115.5] months, vs 83.5 [73.5] months in PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a female predominance (84% and 60% in SAPS and PAPS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of arterial (43%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (39%), fetal loss (40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature births</z:hpo> (9%), anticardiolipin antibodies (88%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (54%) were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ANA-IFI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was higher in SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAPS and SAPS did not present any differences in the clinical manifestations and immunological disorders of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those patients with SAPS were younger at the beginning of the disease and there was a female predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our patients were different from those included in other Spanish published series, which could be explained by selection and classification bias </plain></SENT>
