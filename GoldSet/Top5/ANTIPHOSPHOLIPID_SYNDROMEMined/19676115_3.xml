<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ligand-binding domains of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors consist of multiple homologous LA modules connected by flexible linkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated at the atomic level the features of the LA modules required for binding to B2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare the binding interface in B2GPI/LA complex to that observed in the high-resolution co-crystal structure of the receptor associated protein (RAP) with a pair of LA modules 3 and 4 from the LDLR, we used LA4 in our studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we found that LA4 interacts with B2GPI and the binding site for B2GPI on the (15)N-labeled LA4 is formed by the calcium coordinating residues of the LA module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We built a model for the complex between domain V of B2GPI (B2GPI-DV) and LA4 without introducing any experimentally derived constraints into the docking procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our model, which is in the agreement with the NMR data, suggests that the binding interface of B2GPI for the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors is centered at three lysine residues of B2GPI-DV, Lys 308, Lys 282, and Lys317 </plain></SENT>
