<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few contrasting studies raised the issue about the possibility to detect a comparable endothelial perturbation in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this observational case-control study was to evaluate several parameters of endothelial perturbation in patients with APS and without any other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated plasma levels of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (s-ICAM-1, s-VCAM-1, s-E-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) by solid-phase assays in 40 selected APS patients and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated circulating endothelial cells by flow cytometry and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls were free of conditions known to affect both the biological and the functional endothelial parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma levels of sTM, s-E-selectin and s-VCAM-1 did not differ from controls, while a significant increase in s-ICAM-1 (P = 0.029), t-PA (P = 0.003) and vWF titres (P = 0.002) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Circulating mature endothelial cells were also significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.05) and decreased during both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> (P = 0.001) and antiplatelet (P = 0.032) treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation responses were significantly impaired compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As a whole these findings indicate that APS patients display an endothelial perturbation in the absence of other detectable traditional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
