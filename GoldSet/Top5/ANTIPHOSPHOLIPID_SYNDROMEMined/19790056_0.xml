<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis, utilizing 2 experimental mouse models, that plasmin is an important autoantigen that drives the production of certain IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/cJ and MRL/MpJ mice were immunized with Freund's complete adjuvant in the presence or absence of human plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mouse sera were analyzed for production of IgG antiplasmin, IgG aCL, and IgG anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were generated from the plasmin-immunized MRL/MpJ mice with high titers of aCL, and these 10 mAb were studied for their binding properties and functional activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasmin-immunized BALB/cJ mice produced high titers of IgG antiplasmin only, while plasmin-immunized MRL/MpJ mice produced high titers of IgG antiplasmin, IgG aCL, and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both strains of mice immunized with the adjuvant alone did not develop IgG antiplasmin or IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 of the IgG mAb bound to human plasmin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, while 4 of 10 bound to beta(2)GPI, 3 of 10 bound to thrombin, and 4 of 10 bound to the activated coagulation factor X (FXa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functionally, 4 of the 10 IgG mAb inhibited plasmin activity, 1 of 10 hindered inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III, and 2 of 10 inhibited inactivation of FXa by antithrombin III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasmin immunization leads to production of IgG antiplasmin, aCL, and anti-beta(2)GPI in MRL/MpJ mice, but leads to production of only IgG antiplasmin in BALB/cJ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IgG mAb generated from plasmin-immunized MRL/MpJ mice bind to various antigens and exhibit procoagulant activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that plasmin may drive potentially prothrombotic aCL in genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
