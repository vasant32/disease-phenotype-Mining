<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three thousand six hundred and eighty-four consecutive patient sera were routinely tested for IgGabeta2 GPI over 1 year using an in-house ELISA with 2 different commercial preparations of human purified beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 340 sera found positive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those clinically documented were included in this study; 61 were positive with only one preparation (S1) and 59 with both (S2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of ELISA were confirmed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> was stressed by testing sera with a human recombinant protein and 3 beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No contribution of glycosylation in the binding to beta2GPI was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The avidity indices for each protein were significantly higher in S1 than in S2 (p=0.0021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>S2 were more associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> than S1 (75% versus 21% ; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar frequency of the main clinical features of APS was found in S1 and S2 sera (69% and 71%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data show a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the antigenic reactivity pattern of IgG- abeta2 GPI and a relationship between a binding profile and antibody avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> could represent a crucial factor of variability in test results and underlines the difficulty of getting standardisation </plain></SENT>
