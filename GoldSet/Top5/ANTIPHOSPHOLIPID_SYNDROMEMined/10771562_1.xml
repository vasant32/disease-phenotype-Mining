<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Latest data suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive systemic disorder with occlusion of small and medium sized vessels (e.g., cutis, brain, kidneys, heart, eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No conclusive etiology is known, though there are correlations to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, systemic secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hereditary and toxic factors seem to play a role in pathogenesis in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Diagnostic procedure and clinical course of a 56-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> proceeded by LR is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI-, SPECT- and TCD-findings were congruent with diffuse ischemic lesions of the brain due to affection of small- and medium-sized vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological specimens of the brain, meninges and cutis were non diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some laboratory findings suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> as an underlying cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LR improved under immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and azathioprin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SNS does not seem to be a nosological entity </plain></SENT>
