<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We recently suggested that many anticardiolipin antibodies bind only to oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (OxCL) and/or to OxCL-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta(2)GP1) adducts but not to a "reduced" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> that is unable to undergo oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we investigated 24 sera, 4 protein A-purified IgG fractions, and 3 human monoclonal antibodies that were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isolated from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS); testing was also performed in 7 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal antibodies (IS3 and IS4) were selected for binding to CL and one was selected for binding to beta(2)GP1 (LJB8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: By chemiluminescent immunoassay, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APS sera samples bound only to OxCL and not to reduced CL, and the binding was inhibited &gt;95% by OxCL but not reduced CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> purified IgG fractions bound to beta(2)GP1 but only when the beta(2)GP1 was plated on microtiter wells coated with OxCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 monoclonal antibodies bound only to OxCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Western blots, IS4 and LJB8 bound to beta(2)GP1 as well as to delipidated apoB of oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> but not to native apoB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IS3 also bound to oxidized apoB on Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Covalent modification of beta(2)GP1 with oxidation products of CL made it more antigenic for APS serum samples, for purified IgG fractions, and for the monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that oxidation of CL is needed to generate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for many anticardiolipin antibodies and that some of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> are covalent adducts of OxCL with beta(2)GP1 or apoB </plain></SENT>
