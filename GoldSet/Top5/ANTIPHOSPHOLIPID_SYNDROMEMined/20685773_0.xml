<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In primary APS, there is no detectable underlying disease, while overlap APS is associated with clinical syndromes including systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out a retrospective analysis of serological and clinical manifestations as well as assessed outcome-measures in 165 patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic manifestations and possible signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were determined at the time of the diagnosis, followed by the analysis of recurrent thrombotic events and effects of therapy during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 165 patients with primary APS at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 105 patients (63%) remained primary APS after a mean 5.2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14% of the patients, subsequently APS became associated with various characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally 23% of patients evolved into a definitive systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> during a mean 9.75 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent thrombotic events were registered in 24% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that primary APS may be considered as a potential early phase of a dynamic transition towards a well-defined systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
