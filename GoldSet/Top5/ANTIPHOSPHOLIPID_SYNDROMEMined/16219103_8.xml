<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When derived from endothelial cells, MP were found characteristic of thrombotic propensity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prothrombotic status of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APL), a past history of mesenteric vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and extensive intracardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was examined by measurement of circulating procoagulant MP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MP of platelet and endothelial origins were highly elevated with respect to values detectable in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and no history of APS (6- and 3-fold elevation, respectively) or in healthy volunteers (13- and 25-fold elevation, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this particular patient, with moderate APL titer, a drastic release of procoagulant MP could have contributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth and the development of extensive intracardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
