<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of age on oral contraceptive-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women seen in the University of Padua Department of Medical and Surgical Science who had had two courses of oral contraceptive therapy at different ages were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 subjects met these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had a congenital or acquired prothrombotic condition, whereas 13 women were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at which <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred was 33.3 and 36.3 years for women with or without a prothrombotic condition, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ages during which the women remained asymptomatic were 23.1 and 23.3 years for women with or without a predisposing defect, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> occurred, during the second course of oral contraceptive therapy, after the mean duration of 6.5 cycles or 18.4 cycles in women with or without prothrombotic defects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the asymptomatic course, approximately the same number of women took old <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> or third-generation compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, during the second period, 21 of 28 women took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> with third-generation compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age seems to plays an important role in oral contraceptive-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred after a greater number of oral contraceptive cycles as compared with the women with prothrombotic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the majority of women took preparations that contained third-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> during the second course of therapy, concomitant contributing effects of these compounds cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
