<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (HITTS) or without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (HIT) who also had an elevated baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: Four patients with HIT/HITTS and an elevated baseline aPTT due to APS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 1 had limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and 1 had isolated HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 were managed with a weight-based fixed dose of argatroban without laboratory monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had thrombotic or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications once therapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Management of patients with HIT/HITTS and an abnormal baseline aPTT due to APS is problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We review alternative management strategies, such as monitoring direct thrombin inhibitors with the ecarin clotting time or thrombin inhibition time or using an alternative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, such as fondaparinux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As of March 13, 2006, none of these management strategies has been evaluated in a clinical trial for this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We report the successful use of weight-based, fixed-dose argatroban without laboratory monitoring in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of a fixed-dose argatroban regimen without laboratory monitoring is a potential management strategy for patients with HIT/HITTS and an elevated baseline aPTT due to APS </plain></SENT>
