<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta2glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is the main target antigen for aPL, but the pathogenic role of anti-β2GPI antibodies (aβ2GPI) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some authors assume they play a role in activating platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of aβ2GPI antibodies on platelet P-selectin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aβ2GPI antibodies in the plasma of a pregnant APS patient were isolated by affinity chromatography at two different stages (catastrophic and quiescent) of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gel filtered platelets (100 x 109/L) from healthy volunteers were incubated with β2-GPI (20 µg/mL) and with different concentrations (5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>25 and 50 µg/mL) of aβ2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-selectin surface expression on platelets was assessed by flow cytometry using a specific fluorescent antibody directed against P-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aβ2GPI antibodies induced platelet activation only in the presence of thrombin receptor activator for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 6 (TRAP-6), a platelet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, at a subthreshold concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aβ2GPI antibody enhancement on platelet surface P-selectin expression was stronger in the catastrophic than in the quiescent phase of the disease (47 vs 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TRAP-6 dependent platelet activation by aβ2GPI antibodies is consistent with the "two hit" pathogenetic hypothesis for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aβ2GPI antibodies induce higher platelet P-selectin expression during the active rather than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases </plain></SENT>
