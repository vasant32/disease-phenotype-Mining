<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate that osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as an important molecule in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the association between serum OPG levels and APS manifestations in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients with SLE and ninety-two healthy controls, matched for age and sex, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of OPG, monocyte chemoattractant protein(<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1 and soluble E-selectin were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of serum sampling, various clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that serum levels of OPG were significantly higher in patients with SLE than in healthy controls (1236 +/- 82 vs 967 +/- 37 pg/mL, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particularly, serum OPG levels were significantly higher in SLE patients with APS than those without (1615 +/- 191 vs 1171 +/- 91 pg/mL, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum OPG levels correlated with titres of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody (P = 0.026) and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum OPG also correlated with serum levels of sE-selectin (P = 0.002), which is an endothelial cell activation marker, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 (P = 0.003), a well known chemokine implicated in thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collectively, serum OPG levels were increased in SLE patients with APS and correlated with titres of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, suggesting that OPG might be linked to the development of APS </plain></SENT>
