<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity are clinical features of the definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These clinical complications are also associated with the presence of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interactions between acquired and genetic risk factors are becoming increasingly related to a higher thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of four common gene polymorphisms in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of 105 consecutive unselected patients with aPL grouped as having APS (n= 69) and not having APS (n= 36) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group of 200 healthy subjects was also investigated for the presence of factor V Leiden (FVL), the 20210A allele of the prothrombin (PT-20210A) gene, the thermolabile variant (677TT) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR), and the 4G/4G genotype of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients who belong to the APS group carried the FVL while PT-20210A was found in 6 patients with APS (8.7%) and in 1 of the non-APS group (2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of FVL was similar to that found in the control group whereas PT-20210A was significantly more frequent in APS patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (2.0%, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR-677TT was found in 22.0%, 15.1% and 13.0%, and the PAI-1 (4G/4G) in 27.5%, 22.8% and 23.5% of APS, non-APS patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, combinations of PT-20210A or FVL with PAI-1 (4G/4G) were significantly more frequent in APS patients (5.8%) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.5%, p=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This difference was not found between non-APS patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Present data indicate that testing for heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> would be important to identify aPL subjects with an increased risk of developing APS </plain></SENT>
