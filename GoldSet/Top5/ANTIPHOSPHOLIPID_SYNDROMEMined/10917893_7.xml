<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the treatment generated a nicked form of beta(2)-GPI and resulted in loss of antigenicity for the autoantibodies detected in ELISA, using an beta(2)-GPI directly adsorbed polyoxygenated carboxylated plate, the assay system of which was not related to PL binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nicked form bound to neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29036">Cu(2+)</z:chebi>-oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) nor to beta(2)-GPI-specific <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> ligands isolated from oxLDL, the result being a complete loss of subsequent binding of anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conformational change in the nicked domain V was predicted from its intact structure determined by an X-ray analysis (implemented in Protein Data Bank: 1C1Z), molecular modeling and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping of a monoclonal anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody, i.e. Cof-18, which recognizes the related structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that novel hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions appeared in domain V after the cleavage, thereby affecting the PL binding of beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such a conformational change may have important implications for exposure of cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> located in the domains such as domain IV </plain></SENT>
