<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here two interesting cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>(SLE) accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>(APSN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases satisfied the criteria for SLE established by the American College of Rheumatology 1997 and also satisfied the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) established by the Sapporo International Workshop of APS 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cases had <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000848'>elevated plasma renin</z:hpo> activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their biopsied renal specimens showed the characteristic findings for APSN, such as mesangial proliferation, double contours, thickening of the capillary loops, and intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, but there was no evidence for immune complexes in the glomeruli, which were examined by the indirect immunofluorescence methods and the electron microscopy method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> was caused by APSN, but not by immune complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, they were administered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>(<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, or aspirin, or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) for APSN and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, their conditions recovered with the improvement of renal function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our experiences suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> offers advantages in the treatment of patients with SLE accompanied by APSN and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
