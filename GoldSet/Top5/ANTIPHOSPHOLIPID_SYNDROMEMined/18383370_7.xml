<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) is an important autoantigen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies suggest that it may have multifaceted physiologic functions, since it displays both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and procoagulant properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that beta2GPI can directly bind thrombin, a key serine protease in the coagulation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to examine the influence of beta2GPI on thrombin inactivation by the serpin <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> cofactor II (HCII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-beta2GPI antibodies was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HCII inactivation of thrombin was assessed using chromogenic and various platelet functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of intact and proteolytically cleaved beta2GPI and anti-beta2GPI antibodies was determined in these systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: beta2GPI protected thrombin against inactivation by HCII/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cleavage of beta2GPI at Lys317-Thr318 abrogated its protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient polyclonal IgG and murine monoclonal anti-beta2GPI antibodies potentiated the procoagulant influence of beta2GPI in this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These novel findings suggest that beta2GPI may regulate thrombin inactivation by HCII/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The observation that anti-beta2GPI antibodies potentiate the protective effect of beta2GPI on thrombin in this system, thereby promoting a procoagulant response, may potentially delineate one of the pathophysiologic mechanisms contributing to the prothrombotic tendency in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
