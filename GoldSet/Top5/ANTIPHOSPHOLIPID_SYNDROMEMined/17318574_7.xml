<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study enrolled serum samples obtained from 87 SLE and 97 CVA patients who have been checked for the existence of anti-beta2 GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, the prevalence rate of anti-CMV IgG and IgM in patients with and without anti-beta2 GP1 were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, the prevalence of anti-CMV IgG and IgM were compared between SLE and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Last, this study analyzed the clinical characteristics and disease activity in SLE patients with positive anti-CMV IgM and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference existed in the prevalence rate of anti-CMV IgG and IgM between positive or negative anti-beta2 GP1 serum samples in both SLE and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of anti-CMV IgM was significantly higher in the SLE group than in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of clinical features and SLEDAI scores were considerably higher in patients with positive anti-CMV IgM than in SLE patients with negative anti-CMV IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Very impressively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IgM-positive SLE samples (9/9) carrying highest levels of anti-CMV IgG, indicated reactivation of the latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, it suggests that CMV reactivation might contribute toward the disease flare in some SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In future, a prospective and longitudinal study is stongly indicated </plain></SENT>
