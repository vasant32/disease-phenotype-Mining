<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may be as high as 30-60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of these autoantibodies in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, persistence and clinical significance of aPLs in a series of patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A cohort of 94 patients aged 15 or older, recently diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> EBV was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples obtained during diagnosis were tested for the presence of aPLs and anti-β2GP antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive sera for aPLs were assessed for the persistence of aPLs and the development of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of aPLs among 94 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> EBV was 37.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of 27 available serum samples were also positive for anti-β2 glycoprotein (anti-β2GP) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat testing for aPLs after a median of 21 months post <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (range 13-50 months) was performed in 17 of the 35 patients with positive aPL test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients were found negative for aPL-IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of them had positive aPL-IgM antibodies and positive anti-β2GP antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who had positive aPLs experienced any manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The disappearance of aPLs in the majority of the patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e>, along with the absence of consistent clinical findings, suggests that the detection of aPLs during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> EBV is not associated with the development APS over time </plain></SENT>
