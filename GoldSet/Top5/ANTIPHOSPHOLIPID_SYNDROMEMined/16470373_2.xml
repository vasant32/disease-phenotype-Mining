<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some interpret the cutaneous lesions and their histopathology as a thrombotic/occlusive condition, while others consider it leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical similarities between the cutaneous manifestations of LP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) led us to investigate the relationship between these two pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the clinical, laboratory and histopathologic aspects of LuL and LP in one patient and compare these results to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> showed positive anticardiolipin (aCL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histopathological slides of cutaneous biopsies were stained by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin and Fite-Faraco </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They showed the typical features of LuL, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, endothelial proliferation, vessel wall thickening and obliteration of the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical pattern of LuL in our case is identical to that described by Lucio and Latapi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The necrotic lesions of LP in our patient resembled APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that LP could be considered APS secondary to LuL </plain></SENT>
