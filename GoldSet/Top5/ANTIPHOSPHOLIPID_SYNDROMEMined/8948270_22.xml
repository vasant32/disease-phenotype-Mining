<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we describe a similar set of circumstances, but in patients without evidence of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 6 patients with recurrent venous and/or arterial thromboses without aPL as detected by routine assays nor clinical or serological evidence of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies to bovine and human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free beta 2 GP-I were studied by Western blot test and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing radiated and nonirradiated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also tested antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As controls, 54 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients had recurrent arterial and/or venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had aPL, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had serum IgG reactivity against human and bovine beta 2 GP-I (P &lt; 0.001 versus controls for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Titers of anti-bovine beta 2 GP-I were higher when studied in irradiated plates but were also higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in nonirradiated plates (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These antibodies did not recognize human or bovine beta 2 GP-I bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in solid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We confirmed by Western blot that these autoantibodies recognize human beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no IgM a beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a primary condition akin to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with negative aPL, but with serum IgG antibodies to human and bovine beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These antibodies recognize beta 2 GP-I <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> that are not accessible when beta 2 GP-I is bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
