<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical findings of nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, which posed a serious differential diagnostic problem regarding T-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with hyperplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were two males and seven females aged 25 to 65 years (median 37 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients had multicentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> in association with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of an "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and the remaining five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (SS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>, RA and SS, and SLE and SS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the nine patients developed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> during the follow-up periods from 44 to 225 months (median 103 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesions were characterized by paracortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with prominent vascular proliferation and many lymphoid follicles with germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The paracortical area usually contained numerous small T-lymphocytes without cytological atypia, accompanied by a variable number of plasma cells, B-immunoblasts, and histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated no clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor chain gene in four cases examined, although immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement was detected in only one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, especially SLE, shares the histological features with T-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with hyperplastic follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nine cases presented here should be differentiated from T-zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with follicles and angioimmunoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with hyperplastic germinal centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, we emphasize the need to turn attention to these clinical and laboratory findings as well as to the morphological features </plain></SENT>
