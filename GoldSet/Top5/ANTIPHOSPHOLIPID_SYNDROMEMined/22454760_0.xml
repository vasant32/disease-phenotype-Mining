<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in experimental APS (eAPS) mice brains, we measured the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 in brain homogenates (cytosolic fractions) and in brain slices (secreted level) at 6, 15, and 24 weeks after immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We induced eAPS by immunization of Balb/c mice with β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2)GPI), the major autoantigen in the disease and controls with adjuvant alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found increased levels of secreted TNF-α in eAPS mice for the entire experiment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic and secreted IL-10 and IFN-γ levels in eAPS mice were lower at 6 and 15 weeks and higher at 24 weeks after immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> in APS is associated with significant and complex changes in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
