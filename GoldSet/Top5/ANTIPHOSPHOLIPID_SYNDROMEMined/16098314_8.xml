<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 56 patients with APLS evaluated at baseline, 47 (84%) had repeat TEE examinations, including 3 patients who died before the end of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first TEE study showed cardiac involvement (thickening or vegetations and embolic sources) in 34 subjects (61%), with mitral valve thickening, the most common abnormality, present in 30 patients (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embolic sources were found in 14 patients (25%; 9 severe spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, 5 Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>), associated with mitral valve thickening or stenosis in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the 5-year follow-up, cardiac involvement was unchanged in 30 subjects (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were observed in 17 patients (36%), 15 (88%) with high immunoglobulin-G (IgG) anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) titers and 2 (12%) with low IgG aCL titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study showed that mitral valve thickening and embolic sources are frequently observed in patients with APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or antiplatelet treatment was ineffective in terms of valvular lesion regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New appearances of cardiac involvement are significantly related to high IgG aCL titers </plain></SENT>
