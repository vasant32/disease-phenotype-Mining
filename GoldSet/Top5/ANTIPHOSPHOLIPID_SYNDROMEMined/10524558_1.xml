<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> have usually been implicated as the main causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, even after careful exclusion of these aetiologies, the problem remains whether to classify the patient as having a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> with associated autoimmune clinical and laboratory features resembling SLE, such as autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, or as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> as a manifestation of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the case of an elderly woman who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, who had been diagnosed with SLE 14 years ago and who also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>'s syndrome for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The histology depicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and, after drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> were excluded, the serological and clinical features were shown to be typical of liver damage caused by SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> 100 mg/d and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 30 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms resolved in 10 days and the laboratory values were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the end of the first month of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> was progressively reduced, during a period of 4 months, to 10 mg/d but <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> was kept to the same dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One year after the diagnoses the patient is still in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although uncommon, hepatic involvement is well recognised in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interest of this case lies in the differential diagnosis and recognition of this condition, which deserves an aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
