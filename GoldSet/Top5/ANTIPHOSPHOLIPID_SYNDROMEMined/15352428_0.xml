<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At hospitalization, there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was palpable in the epigastric region, and there was tenderness in this region, but no muscular defense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no findings which indicated disease activity of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result of abdominal ultrasonography showed that there was a giant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, which occupied the majority of the left lobule of the liver, and a nonuniform ultrasound image was observed inside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result of dynamic computed tomography (CT) showed peripheral globular enhancement, and enhancement then extended to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> center with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with multiple hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After admission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> rapidly deteriorated, and platelet count tended to decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intratumor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was suspected, and emergent angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For hemostatic purposes, transcatheter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolization</z:e> (TAE) and extended left hepatic lobectomy were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e>, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is observed, care should be paid to identifying its cause, considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> may be induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, although these cases are extremely rare </plain></SENT>
