<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were under treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AVN occurred in seven occurred in seven of the 69 patients (10.14%) and was not related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 69 patients were also treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy (MPPT) and cumulated the highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> doses but none of them suffered from AVN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluding the 17 MPPT-treated SLE patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> intake was significantly higher in the AVN-SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal IgG and/or IgM aCL serum levels were found in two of the seven AVN-SLE patients and in 24 of the 62 non-AVN SLE, without a statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the seven AVN-SLE patients showed features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in SLE patients a continuous high-dose steroid treatment may be considered a risk factor for AVN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, MPPT regimen may reduce this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies might represent an added factor which could play a role in some patients but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
