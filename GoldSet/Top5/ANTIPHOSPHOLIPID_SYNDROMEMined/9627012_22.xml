<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human aCL IgG MAb were generated from hybridized Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell lines from a healthy subject (MAb 519) and from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (MAb 516) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of antigen-binding specificity and analysis of Ig V-gene mutations were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MAb were independently injected into mated female BALB/c mice, and their effect on pregnancy outcome was compared with that of MAb 57, a highly mutated and antigen-selected human IgG1lambda <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034494" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rabies</z:e> virus antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both MAb 519 and MAb 516 utilized minimally mutated V(H)DJ(H) and VkappaJkappa gene segments and bound <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and other anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the absence of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice injected with aCL MAb displayed a significantly higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> and a significant reduction in fetal and placental weight as compared with those injected with MAb 57 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were accompanied by a finding of placental human IgG deposition and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the aCL MAb-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that human aCL IgG that are beta2-GPI independent can induce pathology </plain></SENT>
