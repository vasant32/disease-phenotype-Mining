<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (n = 22) and non-APS (n = 24), positive in a standard aCL ELISA, were tested in an anti-beta 2GPI ELISA performed in <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi>-irradiated ELISA plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">Urea</z:chebi> resistance aCL and anti-beta 2GPI ELISAs were performed by measuring the ability of antibodies to recognize antigen in the presence of 2 M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum dilution after <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> treatment (D) expressed as a percentage of the serum dilution without <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> treatment (D(o)) corresponding to the same optical density was defined as residual activity (RA = 100 D/D(o)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher the RA, the higher the resistance of the antibodies to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS compared to non-APS sera had higher aCL binding (absorbance values ranging between 0.180 and 1.400; median, 0.717 vs 0.120-1.273; median, 0.250, respectively; P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six APS patients' sera had low aCL levels but they expressed RA &gt; or = 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2GPI antibodies were detected in 15 of 22 APS vs 3 of 24 non-APS patients (P &lt; 0.03); RA &gt; or = 30% was detected in 15 of 22 APS vs 1 of 23 non-APS patients (P &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a CL affinity column, antibodies were purified from three APS anti-beta 2GPI negative and three non-APS anti-beta 2GPI-positive patients and tested in a aCL ELISA, using highly purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a blocking agent (modified ELISA); reactivity was not detected in two APS and one non-APS sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the reactivity of the purified antibodies was high when beta 2GPI was incubated with CL in the ELISA plates; thus some anti-beta 2GPI negative sera from APS patients recognized the CL/beta 2GPI complex, rather than CL or beta 2GPI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies are common in the APS patients, but a number of such patients recognize the CL/beta 2GPI complex and not CL or beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to either beta 2GPI or the CL/beta 2GPI complex derived from APS sera present a high resistance to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2GPI antibodies of low <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> resistance exist in a minority of non-APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
