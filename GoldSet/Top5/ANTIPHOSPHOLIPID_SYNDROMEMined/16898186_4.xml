<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Circulating oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes have been demonstrated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> contribute to oxLDL/beta2GPI complex formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> suggest that these complexes are formed in the arterial wall and released into circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of antibodies to oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes indicates that these complexes are immunogenic, and the coexistence of complexes and antibodies suggest an active pro-thrombotic/pro-atherogenic role in the development of autoimmune vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes can be measured by ELISA using a monoclonal antibody specific to complexed human beta2GPI to capture beta2GPI bound to oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-conjugated monoclonal antibody to human Apo B 100 allows the specific detection of oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OxLDL/beta2GPI complexes were common in SLE and APS patients suggesting an underlying process of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes as capture antigen, antibodies to oxLDL/beta2GPI can be measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies were significantly higher in SLE patients with APS compared to SLE controls without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, high titers of these IgG antibodies were observed in APS patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of circulating oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes and IgG antibodies to these complexes indicates significant vascular injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> as well as an active role in autoimmune-mediated atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
