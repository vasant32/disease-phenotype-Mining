<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of congenital and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and to analyse the clinical characteristics of a group of patients with high risk criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-five consecutive patients seen at the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> outpatient clinic of the Oviedo Central Hospital between 1987 and 1993 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had to meet one or more of the following: 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) under 45 years of age; 2) repeat VT; 3) family history of VT; 4) unusual VT location (mesenteric, brain, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was performed 4 to 7 months after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode and at least one month after suppression of anti-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following test were carried out: blood cell counts, basic coagulation tests (APTT, PT, TT, RT and fibrinogen), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> detection, with and without platelet extract, diluted tissular thromboplastin inhibition test, antibodies, anticardiolipin, liver and kidney functional screen, cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and glycaemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The venous occlusion test after 20-minute stasis was used for the global fibrinolysis study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistical evaluation was performed with the SPSS programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biologic alterations were present in 98 patients (35%), 12% corresponding to congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and 23% to acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 187 patients (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, 4.9% had protein C (PC) deficit, 3.4% protein S (PS) deficit, and 2.4% antithrombin III (AT-III) deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, 4.5% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and 18% had impaired fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the data analysed, the patient history was found of scarce predictive value as to the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found for family history of VT (p &lt; 0.0005) and for the association of more than one criteria for inclusion (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No conclusions could be drawn from this study regarding the prophylactic attitude in patients with congenital abnormalities or anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is recommended to assess in such patients PC, PS and AT-III activities </plain></SENT>
