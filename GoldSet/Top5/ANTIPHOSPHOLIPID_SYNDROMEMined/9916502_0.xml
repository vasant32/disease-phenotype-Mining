<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was obviously higher in patients who had both aCL and LA than in patients with either aCL or LA alone or in those with neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since a substantial fraction of the former group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, there is a possibility that aCL and LA might enhance platelet activation and aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we studied the in vitro effects of aCL and LA on the enhancement of platelet activation by flow cytometric analysis using anti-CD62P and anti-CD41 monoclonal antibodies directed against platelet activation-dependent granule-external membrane (PADGEM) protein and platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb (GPIIb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IgG fraction purified from aCL+.LA+ plasma apparently enhanced platelet activation induced by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) at a low concentration, but IgG fractions from aCL+.LA- or aCL-.LA+ plasma did not cause enhancement of platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aCL and LA may cooperate to promote platelet activation, and may be involved, at least partially, in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
