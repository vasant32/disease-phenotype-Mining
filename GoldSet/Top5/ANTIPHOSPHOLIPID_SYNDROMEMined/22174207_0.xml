<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant body of evidence has evolved to support the hypothesis that antibody-mediated disruption of an annexin A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> shield may play a role in the pathogenesis; this proposed mechanism has not been previously studied in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the association between aPL and resistance to annexin A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity in 90 children with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> using a novel mechanistic assay, the annexin A5 resistance assay (A5R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a diagnosis of primary aPL syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> demonstrated lower mean A5R levels (p = 0.030), higher prevalence of positive aPL (p &lt; 0.001), and more thrombotic events (p = 0.014) compared to those with other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with persistently positive aPL had significantly lower mean A5R compared to patients with no aPL (mean A5R = 203% ± 44% vs 247% ± 35%; p &lt; 0.001), whereas patients with transient aPL did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had lower A5R levels compared to those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (mean A5R = 207% ± 36% vs 237% ± 46%; p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> and persistent aPL have reduced annexin A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, whereas transient, nonpathogenic aPL have less effect on annexin A5 activity </plain></SENT>
