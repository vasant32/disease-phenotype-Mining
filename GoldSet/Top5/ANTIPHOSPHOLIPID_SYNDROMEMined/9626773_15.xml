<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL-Ab) are associated with various neurologic syndromes, but idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (IIH) has only rarely been reported in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To delineate the frequency and clinical and radiological features of, as well as the cause-and-effect relationship between, ACL-Ab and IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of patients with IIH hospitalized between January 1989 and September 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance venography or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluded were patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> due to dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or traumatic, structural, neoplastic, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who were found on at least 2 separate occasions to have increased IgG titers of ACL-Ab were identified and compared with patients without ACL-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six (43%) of 14 patients with IIH had ACL-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in clinical, laboratory, or radiological variables could be found between patients with and without ACL-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of the 11 ACL-Ab-positive patients had previous systemic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurologic abnormalities</z:hpo> associated with ACL-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anticardiolipin antibodies may cause IIH through mechanisms unrelated to major <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is frequently associated with ACL-Ab and can be the presenting symptom of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are no major clinical, laboratory, or radiological features that distinguish between patients with IIH with and without ACL-Ab </plain></SENT>
