<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated hematological findings of 43 children with SLE diagnosed and followed at the Pediatric Rheumatology Division of Hacettepe University, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> were analyzed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological involvement was seen in 86% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common hematological finding was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was either a Coombs (+) hemolytic one, or was due to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>Hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> was treated with steroids and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Leucopenia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were detected in 35.1 % and 37.8 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was performed in 15, mainly for cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary dysplastic changes were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) was diagnosed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six patients were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macrophage activation syndrome</z:e> (MAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary infections</z:e> and multiorgan failure despite aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients diagnosed early, treatment with steroids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> resulted in an excellent response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> was detected in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both were treated successfully with steroids and plasma exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies were positive in 12 and 15 of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Five developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), one cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> fulminans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>They were effectively treated with anticoagulation protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hematological findings should be carefully assessed and treated vigorously to prevent the morbidity and possible mortality </plain></SENT>
