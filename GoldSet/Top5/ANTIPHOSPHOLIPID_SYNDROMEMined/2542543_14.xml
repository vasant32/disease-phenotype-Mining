<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of clinical and laboratory evidence of SLE, he was considered to have a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coagulation studies revealed a functional deficiency of protein C although it was present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antigenic amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since both his parents had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional and antigenic protein C findings, his deficiency was considered acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of the anticardiolipin antibodies could be decreased in a dose dependent fashion when preincubated with increasing amounts of thrombomodulin, a protein required for protein C activation at the endothelial cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This interaction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> with thrombomodulin may help explain the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, despite the behavior in vitro of these antibodies as circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
