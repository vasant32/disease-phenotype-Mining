<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether these aPL can bind to beta 2GPI in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have purified anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) from the plasma of four patients and beta 2GPI from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma by solid phase affinity methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four aCL bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine in the presence of beta 2GPI but not in its absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of two of the antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine at various concentrations of human beta 2GPI was compared with that obtained using 10% bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two antibodies responded differently to increasing beta 2GPI concentrations, and binding to phosphatidylserine was relatively greater than to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> using human beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four aCL bound to plastic plates coated with beta 2GPI in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, and beta 2GPI in the fluid phase had no effect on binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding to beta 2GPI coated plates was increased equally when bovine serum or bovine albumin were used as the sample diluent in place of gelatine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings and those of others have important implications for the design of assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
