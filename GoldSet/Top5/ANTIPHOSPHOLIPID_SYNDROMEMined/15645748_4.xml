<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to analyse the association of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (ptHcy), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and other vascular risk factors in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma levels of ptHcy, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> were measured in 117 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and immunological data were obtained from our prospective computerized database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>aPL-positivity was defined according to Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between aPL and ptHcy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ptHcy was higher in patients with arterial (median 13.02 versus 10.16 micromol/L, P = 0.010) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, this association was only seen in aPL-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, aPL (OR 6.60, 95% CI 1.86-23.34) and ptHcy (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19) were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking and plasma total cholesterol were added to the model, only aPL (OR 7.38, 95% CI 2.02-26.91) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 7.70, 95% CI 2.33-25.39), but not ptHcy, remained independently related to arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>aPL was the only variable independently related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 7.68, 95% CI 1.60-36.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ptHcy concentrations are higher in SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Raised ptHcy may be a marker of increased vascular risk in aPL-negative SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> as a marker of vascular risk may depend on the presence of traditional risk factors, although a modest intrinsic effect cannot be entirely excluded </plain></SENT>
