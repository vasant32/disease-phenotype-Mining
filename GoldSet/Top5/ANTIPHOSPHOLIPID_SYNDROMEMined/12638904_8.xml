<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since it was shown in a few case reports that NRH may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) we wanted to analyze the relevance of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 13 patients with histologically defined NRH were tested for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> by an in-house ELISA using as antigens <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-gp I), phosphatidylserine (PS), and thromboplastin (TP), a mixture of different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, sera from patients with serologically and histologically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver diseases</z:e> (primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> n = 14; autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> n = 14) without histological evidence for NRH as well as from 14 healthy blood donors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>77% of the NRH patients had <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 46% they were directed against CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 14% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver diseases</z:e> and 14% of the healthy controls had anti-CL antibodies (p &lt; 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to beta2-gp I and TP did not discriminate between NRH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-PS antibodies were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that determination of anti-CL antibodies in NRH may help to identify a subgroup of patients in whom an 'organ-specific antiphosholipid syndrome' of the liver may be involved in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
