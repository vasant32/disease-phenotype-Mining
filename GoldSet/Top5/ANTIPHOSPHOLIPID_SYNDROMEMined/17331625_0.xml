<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to investigate the frequency of these antibodies in a series of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and to search for a correlation with clinical, biological or histological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antiphospholipid were investigated in 24 patients with well defined autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characteristics were compared between antiphopholipids positive and negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of our patients were also compared toward cases collected in a literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is of 70.8% in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a well defined antiphospholid syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> in the antiphospholipid group whereas none in the antiphospholipid negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the different antiphopholipid antibodies was: IgG ACL (52.9%), IgM APE (52.9%), ACC (43.7%), IgG Abeta2GP1 (41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> and the presence or the isotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation and outcome as biological and histological parameters were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study report a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipids antibodies</z:hpo> in autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However we found no clinical, biological or histological correlation with the presence of antiphospholipids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal studies on larger cohorts should clarify the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and potential therapeutic issues </plain></SENT>
