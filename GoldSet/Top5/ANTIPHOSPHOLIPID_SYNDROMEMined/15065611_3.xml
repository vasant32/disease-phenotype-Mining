<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 664 consecutive patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, who were referred for laboratory testing because of a clinical suspicion of LA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> between June 25, 1990, and July 1, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 664 patients tested for LA, 584 also were tested for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of patients tested for both LA and aCL, 137 (235%) had positive results for one or both tests (13 [95%], LA-positive only; 76 [555%], aCL-positive only; and 48 [35.0%], positive for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) was the most frequently positive LA assay (74% of the 61 patients with positive results for LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (36.1% of the 61) had positive results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 LA assays, whereas 21 (34.4% of the 61) had positive results for only 1 LA assay: activated partial thromboplastin time (3 patients [4.9%]), plasma clot time (5 patients [8.2%]), kaolin clot time (5 patients [8.2%]), or DRVVT (8 patients [13.1%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> prevalence was not definitely associated with positive test results (LA only, aCL only, or LA plus aCL), nor was it strongly associated with aCL isotype or titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> prevalence was not increased when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LA assays were positive, although a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> was nonsignificantly associated with positive results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 LA tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of having both LA- and aCL-positive test results was higher among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (26 [19.0%] of 137 patients with positive results for one or both tests), but they had no more thrombotic events or fetal loss than other patients in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DRVVT identified more patients with LA than the other LA tests, but more than 1 LA test was required to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive results were much more common for aCL than for LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No single LA test or anticardiolipin isotype correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
