<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the consequences of the gene polymorphisms of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in patients positive for aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven Japanese and 82 British patients with aPL were examined for Alu-repeat insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the tPA gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 4G/5G polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter gene by site-directed mutagenesis-PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations between these polymorphisms and clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in the allele frequencies of these genes did not exist between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between these gene polymorphisms and clinical symptoms of APS in patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of the tPA or PAI-1 genes probably do not significantly influence the risk of anerial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, or pregnancy morbidity in patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
