<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were measured in the sera of 107 patients with APS (64 primary APS, 43 secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>)-modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the same patients, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2GPI) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive titre of anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was detected in 22% of patients, but only in 6% of control subjects (chi2 = 12, P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (n = 58) than in those without (n = 49) (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels correlated weakly with those of aCL (r = 0.196, P = 0.043), but not with those of anti-beta2GPI (r = 0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that elevated levels of anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> may represent another potential marker of APS, particularly of patients prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
