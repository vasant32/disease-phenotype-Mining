<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of platelets to prothrombotic disorders has been difficult to analyze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently an assay was reported that measured the procoagulant activity of test platelets by making the platelet <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> surface the limiting factor in the production of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe a novel technique, based on this assay, that we used to study patient serum factors that activate control platelets and in turn initiate measurable procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this assay we investigated a group of patients with prothrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient test serum was incubated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets in the presence of activated factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resultant thrombin was measured in a chromogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate-limiting step was the presence of any potential platelet-activating factors, such as antibodies in the heat-treated test serum, that would allow the Xa to bind to the platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) and the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome enhanced platelet procoagulant activity, while samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HIT serum samples also induced platelet activation, as measured by platelet microparticle shedding, <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36927">carbon 14</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> release, and platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The measurement of serum-induced platelet procoagulant activity provides a method for the investigation of circulating platelet <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in prothrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
