<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Combined oral contraceptives (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi>) increase the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE), but the risk of recurrent VTE is not precisely determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective cohort study, we sought the risk factors for recurrence after a first VTE that occurred in women taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Time-to-event analysis was done with Kaplan-Meier estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 172 patients were included (43% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>): 82% had no other clinical risk factor for VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 160 patients who stopped anticoagulation, the cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE was 5.1% after 1 year and 14.2% after 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant factors associated with recurrence were renewed use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28887">COC</z:chebi> [hazard ratio (HR)=8.2 (2.1-32.2)], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> [HR=4.1 (1.3-12.5)] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> or factor II G20210A [HR=2.7 (1.1-7)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pure-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> contraception [HR=1.3 (0.5-3.0)] or factor V Leiden [HR=1.3 (0.5-3.4)] did not increase recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postsurgical VTE had a lower risk of recurrence [HR=0.1 (0.0-0.9)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further studies are warranted to determine whether testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> or the factor II G20210A could modify the duration of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the safety of pure-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> contraception </plain></SENT>
