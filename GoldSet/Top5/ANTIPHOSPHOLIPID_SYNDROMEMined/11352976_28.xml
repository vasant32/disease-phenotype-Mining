<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) is a major antigen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (Abs) present in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that beta(2)-GPI specifically binds to oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL), but not to native <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a ligand specific for beta(2)-GPI, oxLig-1, was purified from the extracted <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> of oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structure of oxLig-1 was shown to be identical to that of synthesized 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both purified and synthesized oxLig-1 were recognized by beta(2)-GPI and subsequently by anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Abs, either in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or in ligand blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of liposomes containing oxLig-1 (oxLig-1-liposomes) to mouse macrophages, J774A.1 cells, was relatively low, as compared with that of phosphatidylserine (PS)-liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, binding of oxLig-1-liposomes was enhanced more than 10-fold in the presence of both beta(2)-GPI and an anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Ab (WB-CAL-1), derived from (NZW x BXSB) F1 mouse, an animal APS model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI auto-Abs derived from APS patients with episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> were detected in ELISA, using a solid phase oxLig-1 complexed with beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that autoimmune atherogenesis linked to beta(2)-GPI interaction with oxLDL and Abs may be present in APS </plain></SENT>
