<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Tissue factor (TF) is the major intrinsic initiator of clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TF expression on monocytes has been associated with high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of clinical factors on TF activity in blood from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and examined the relationship between aCL and TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross sectional study, consecutive patients with SLE from one rheumatology clinic gave blood samples for measurement of TF activity, aCL, and Russell viper venom time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed disease activity by measuring sedimentation rate, anti-dsDNA, and complement components C3 and C4, and measured clinical indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations were investigated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients contributed blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 38 years, and 10 of the SLE patients had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> had TF activity 1.3 times that in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Users of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) had TF activity significantly lower than nonusers (p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had TF activity significantly lower than patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, aCL and TF activity were not associated when we adjusted for these clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo>, previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> significantly modified TF activity in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike previous reports, we found no association between aCL titer and TF activity, which may be due to our adjusting for other important clinical factors </plain></SENT>
