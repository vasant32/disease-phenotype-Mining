<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the HLA-G serum levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) patients, its impact on clinical and laboratory findings, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four PAPS patients were age and gender matched with 43 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-G serum levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in soluble HLA-G levels was found in patients compared to controls (3.35 (0-22.9) versus 1.1 (0-14), P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in HLA-G levels between patients with and without obstetric events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six percent of patients were being treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> had higher HLA-G levels than ones who were not treated with this medication (5 (0-22.9) versus 1.8 (0-16) ng/mL, P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> who experienced obstetric events had a trend to increased HLA-G levels compared to patients who were not on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and did not have obstetric events (5.8 (0-22.9) versus 2 (0-15.2) ng/mL, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that serum HLA-G levels are increased in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> increases HLA-G levels and may increase tolerance towards autoantigens </plain></SENT>
