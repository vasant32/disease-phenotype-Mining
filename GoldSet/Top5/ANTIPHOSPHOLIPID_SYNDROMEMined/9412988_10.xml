<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that the immune system plays an active part in the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque although its precise role has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) are generally found in the sera of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and are associated with a prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several authors have demonstrated that aCL can activate platelets and endothelial cells as well as increase oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) uptake by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study we sought to assess the effect of immunization with aCL (Ab1, leading to the production of mouse aCL-Ab3) on the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups of 8-weeks old female <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-receptor knockout mice (n = 13 per group) were immunized with IgG purified from the serum of an APS patient or with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aCL immunized mice developed high titres of 'self' aCL (detected using the standard aCL ELISA) as compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG immunized mice, whereas no differences were noted between both study groups with respect to the serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of fatty streak formation was significantly higher in the aCL immunized mice in comparison with the human IgG injected mice (mean aortic lesion size of 5308 +/- 471 microns2 vs 1027 +/- 184 microns2, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques from both mouse groups did not display differences in cellular composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the study show that mouse aCL induced by immunization with human aCL from an APS patient enhance atherogenesis in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-RKO mice and imply that these antibodies may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> development in patients with the APS </plain></SENT>
