<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In recent years anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies have gained much attention since they are frequently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides disease-specific autoantibodies, other autoantibodies reactive with both organ and non-organ specific autoantigens have been found in patients with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the presence and significance of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in untreated patients with different forms of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (26 females, five males; mean age 42.5 years) affected by different autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid diseases</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>, eight by silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>, five by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> in remission were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> patients anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies were evaluated before and after 3 months of therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen out of 31 patients were positive for IgG and/or IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, the highest levels occurring in three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In four of five Graves' patients evaluated before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> therapy, anticardiolipin antibodies decreased following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with increased IgG and/or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies showed clinical manifestations of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome during our observation which ranged from 1 to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed an increased incidence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies in patients affected by autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, these autoantibodies seem merely to represent a non-specific marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
