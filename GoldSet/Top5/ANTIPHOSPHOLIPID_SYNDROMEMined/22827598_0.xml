<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), coagulation assays as well as ELISAs, show methodological shortcomings, which makes the search for better assays everlasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of two new, fully automated systems (Zenit RA and HemosIL Acustar) applying chemiluminescent technology for aPL detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study cohort consisted of a patient population presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such patient population, the demonstration of aPL determines whether a patient has APS or not with implications for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-four patients with thrombotic complications, of whom 26 were patients with definite APS, were integrated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, aPL titres were compared to the Sapporo standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of both systems agreed well with ELISA and mutually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the discrepant results between Zenit and Acustar finally led to one misclassification as APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnostic performances of both Zenit RA and HemosIL Acustar were comparable with odds ratios lower limits of CI of 5 for aβ(2) GPI IgG for Zenit and Acustar and 6 and 5 for aCl IgG on Zenit and Acustar, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, even with these new automated systems, titres differed largely between systems, especially for aβ(2) GPI IgG </plain></SENT>
