<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated prevalence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in 59 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathies</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMAs</z:chebi>) and in 160 patients with immunologic or thrombocytopenic diseases different from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against ADAMTS13 were found in 97% of untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> acquired <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> who had plasma levels of ADAMTS13 activity below 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding prevalence of IgM antibodies was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies of G or M isotypes were detected in 20% of patients with <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> with ADAMTS13 activity above 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ELISA was more sensitive than the standard functional inhibitor assay for detecting antibodies against ADAMTS13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> from various causes (n = 50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE; n = 40), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS; n = 55) had prevalences of IgG antibodies of 8%, 13%, and 5% respectively, only slightly higher than the prevalence in 111 healthy donors (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rather high prevalence of anti-ADAMTS13 IgM antibodies was found in patients with SLE and APS (18% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of IgM antibodies in these groups is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ELISA method detected anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies in a very large proportion of patients with acquired <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, and was more sensitive than the inhibitor assay </plain></SENT>
