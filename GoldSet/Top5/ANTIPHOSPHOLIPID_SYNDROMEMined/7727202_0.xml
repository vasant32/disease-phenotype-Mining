<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these cases brought to light a number of symptoms that have a statistically significant association with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these symptoms have not yet been recognized internationally as diagnostic criteria, we anticipate that they will be included on a revised and lengthened list of clinical symptoms used for the diagnosis of PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a high incidence of neurological symptoms in our case group: disorders were often observed before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of full-blown disease and could be confirmed by means of cerebral NMR and SPECT analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that further investigation will enable researchers to determine the predictive value of these PAPS-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
