<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyse systematically the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and its clinical significance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera of 90 consecutive unselected patients with NHL were tested for the presence of anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2-GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up over a median period of 14 months to note the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in 24 out of 90 NHL patients (26.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were more often detected in women and in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> was not correlated with the histology and the stage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 24 patients with elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> developed a thromboembolic event in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were observed in 12 patients (13.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with negative <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> titres and the combination of positive aCL- and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies, features which are known to be more strongly correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erythematous (SLE), were very uncommon in our cohort of NHL patients (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vessel compression by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> but not elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> remains the main cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in NHL patients </plain></SENT>
