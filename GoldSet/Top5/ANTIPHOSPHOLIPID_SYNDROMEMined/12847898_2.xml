<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 248 case histories of patients admitted to the Institute of Rheumatology for 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary APS was diagnosed in 35 patients, SLE + APS (according to criteria of ACR, 1982)--in 122 patients and SLE without APS--in 91 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 31.2 +/- 15.0 years (range from 14 to 63), median length of follow-up from the time of diagnosis was 11.9 +/- 5.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 8 year period <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients annually and the latest 5 years at least twice a year were examined for the presence of IgG and IgM-anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events were verified with special techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (15%) died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the decreased was 35.4 +/- 12.2 years (range 21-52 years) and the disease duration 8.6 +/- 8.2 years (range 0.6-20), the median length of the survival from the time of the diagnosis was 6.2 +/- 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 8-year survival for SLE patients without APS was 98%, for those with SLE + APS-75% and for patients with primary APS-83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of APS in SLE patients was significantly associated with high mortality (chi 2 = 12.3, freedom = 4, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis revealed that the activity of the disease at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, especially recurrent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, valvular disease of the heart, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">capillaritis</z:e>, digital <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> were independent risk factors for mortality (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, long-term follow-up is necessary for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> especially with APS which lowers survival of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such patients need early corrective therapy to prevent thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
