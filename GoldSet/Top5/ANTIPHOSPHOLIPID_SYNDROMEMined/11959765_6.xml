<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Critically ill</z:e> patients with SLE or APS, or both, admitted to a London teaching hospital ICU over a 15 year period were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, diagnostic, physiological, laboratory, and survival data were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed by age, time from first diagnosis of SLE, and time from first ICU admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The log rank test and a backwards stepwise Cox regression were used to identify factors associated with reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty one patients with SLE alone (39%) and/or APS (61%) required 76 emergency admissions to the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had high severity of illness scores (median APACHE II 22 (range 8-45)) and multiorgan dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary diagnoses for patients admitted were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 31/76 (41%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> in 16/76 (21%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in 12/76 (16%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> in 11/76 (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The commonest secondary diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> before admission, low white cell count, and high severity of illness score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Before adjustment for these factors <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> had a strong adverse effect on long term survival (analysis by age at diagnosis p=0.005, analysis by time since first ICU admission, p=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at admission to ICU was associated with an increased ICU mortality (p=0.02) and was the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 13/17 patients who died in the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, after adjustment, APS was associated with reduced ICU survival (p=0.1) and reduced long term (p=0.03) survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (28%) died in the ICU, and 31 patients (51%) had died by the last follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median time from ICU admission to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall five year survival from the first ICU admission was 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Critical illness</z:e> requiring ICU admission may occur in patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In this study, ICU survival was better than previously described, but long term survival was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> administration, low white cell count, and high severity of illness score were associated with reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Before adjustment for these factors, only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> had an adverse effect on outcome but after adjustment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and APS reduced survival </plain></SENT>
