<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using irradiated plates coated with human beta 2-GPI, we showed that in the sera of patients with AID, optical densities from the coated wells were significantly higher than those from the noncoated ones (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this assay, intra-assay and inter-assay variation coefficients ranged between 4% and 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation showed that IgG-a-beta 2-GPI were found in 23 of 61 patients with AID but in only one patient with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the IgG-a-beta 2-GPI in association with APS (p = 0.005) was statistically significant with high specificity (98%) and positive predictive value (87.5%) but with low sensitivity (54%), and was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IgG-a-beta 2-GPI levels were highly correlated with those of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a-beta 2-GPI, aCL were found with a high prevalence (40%) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of their high specificity, anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies appear to be useful tools in the evaluation of the risk of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, because of their low sensitivity, their detection needs to be associated with that of aCL </plain></SENT>
