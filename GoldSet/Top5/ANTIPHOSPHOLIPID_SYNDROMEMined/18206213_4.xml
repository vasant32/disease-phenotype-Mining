<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of digits or limbs encountered in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one cases derived from several geographical centers (Brazil, Serbia, Italy, Israel, United Kingdom, and South Africa) are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major clinical, serological, and histopathological data (where available) of this cohort are described, documented, and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were suffering mainly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (9 patients) or primary APS (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> occurred during the course of the catastrophic APS in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> occurred both early and very late in the course of the disease (time after APS diagnosis, 0-38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> was present in 7 patients and 5 demonstrated the typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL)--vasculopathy with complicating bland <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> had occurred in 4 patients but it was not possible to determine whether they suffered from premature atherosclerotic disease or whether the infarctions were aPL-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was noted in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>Cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> was detected in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>Peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of digits or limbs is a severe complication encountered in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the absence of histopathology, it may be difficult to distinguish whether concomitant atherosclerotic occlusions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, or aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of peripheral vessels is the main cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment should, therefore, include full anticoagulation as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and immunosuppression in these patients </plain></SENT>
