<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects of the study were 62 patients (mean age 35.7 +/- 11.6 years, disease duration 129 +/- 102 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional and disease-related risk factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotic ultrasonography (CU) was performed in order to reveal vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum CRP levels were measured by the high-sensitive immunonephelometric technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM CLA were studied by solid-phase immunoenzyme assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CU found carotic arterial involvement in 58% of the patients; clinical manifestations of AS were revealed in 42% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups: group I included 19 patients with APLS signs, group II consisted of 43 patients without APLS symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The disease duration and lesion index were higher in group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study revealed a significant correlation between CRP level and intima-media complex (IMC) thickness in patients suffering from SLE with or without APLS (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with AS displayed higher levels of IgG CLA, although the difference was insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that men suffering from SLE with or without APLS have a high risk of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increase in CRP level is associated with an increase in IMC thickness </plain></SENT>
