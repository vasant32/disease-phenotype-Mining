<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)], the active form of plasminogen activator inhibitor (active PAI), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and soluble thrombomodulin (TM), to investigate the relationship of these factors to thrombotic events in APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma levels of Lp(a), TAT, active PAI and TM were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in patients with aPL than in a control group of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Lp(a) and active PAI were significantly higher in patients with aPL and arterial thromboses than in patients with aPL but only venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between plasma levels of Lp(a) and active PAI in patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that patients with aPL are in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High levels of Lp(a) in plasma may impair the fibrinolytic system resulting in thromboses, especially in the arterial system </plain></SENT>
