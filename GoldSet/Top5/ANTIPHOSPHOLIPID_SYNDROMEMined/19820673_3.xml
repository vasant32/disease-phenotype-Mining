<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess maternal and perinatal outcome in a cohort of Portuguese women with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 51 women with primary APS followed in our institution (January 1994 to December 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty one (80.4%) had past pregnancy morbidity and 35.3% (n=18) suffered previous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In their past they had a total of 116 pregnancies of which only 13.79 % resulted in live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty four patients had positive anticardiolipin antibodies and 33 lupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women received treatment with low dose aspirin and LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 67 gestations (66 single and one multiple) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The live birth rate was 85.1% (57/67) with 10 pregnancy failures: seven in the first and second trimesters, one late fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and two medical terminations of pregnancy (one APS related) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/- SD) birth weight was 2837 +/- 812 g and mean gestational age 37 +/- 3.3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were nine cases of FGR and 13 hypertensive complications (4 HELLP syndromes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>54.4% of the patients delivered by caesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, early treatment with aspirin and LMWH combined with close maternal--fetal surveillance was associated with a very high chance of a live newborn </plain></SENT>
