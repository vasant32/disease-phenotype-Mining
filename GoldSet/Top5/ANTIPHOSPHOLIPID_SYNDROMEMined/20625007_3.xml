<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test this notion, we studied 55 patients (80% women) with hematologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> fulfilled the laboratory criteria for primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (64%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 14 (25%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and 6 (11%) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (22 women, 88%) also fulfilled one clinical criterion for APS after a median follow-up of 13.2 years (range, 1.45-37 years), whereas the remaining 30 patients (22 women, 73%) have not had any thrombotic event nor pregnancy morbidity after a median follow-up of 5.4 years (range, 0.12-24 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hematologic manifestation was asynchronous with the APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 84% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response to treatment was similar regardless of the APS status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with definite APS were more frequently positive for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (63%) than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive patients without APS (30%; odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-11.4; P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin or anti-Î²(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies were highly prevalent among the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that, depending upon their antiphospholipid profile, patients with hemocytopenias appear to comprise a peculiar subset of patients with APS; some develop thrombotic and/or obstetric APS whereas others continue with hematologic APS </plain></SENT>
