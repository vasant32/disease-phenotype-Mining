<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence and isotype distribution of antibodies to endothelial cells (aEC) and to beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (a beta 2GPI) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with an APS [nine associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and six "primary'] and 15 with SLE without an APS were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aEC were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein and the a beta 2GPI by ELISA using highly purified beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A positive titre of aEC was detected in 20 out of 30 patients (67%), but in none of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had both IgG and IgM isotypes, five had IgG only and five had only IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with the APS (87%) were found to have a positive titre of aEC, while only seven with SLE but without a history of APS (47%) had aEC (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with the APS (60%) had a positive titre of a beta 2GPI (four had both IgG and IgM isotypes, one had IgG only and four had only IgM), while none of the patients without an APS (0%) had these antibodies (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant association was also found between the presence of aPL and aEC (P &lt; 0.05), as well as between aPL and a beta 2GPI (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both aEC and a beta 2GPI can be found in the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reinforces the theory that APS represents a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> in which several autoantibodies co-exist with aPL </plain></SENT>
