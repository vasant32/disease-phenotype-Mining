<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with positive crossmatch results (n = 9) or negative crossmatch results but strong donor-specific antibodies (DSA; n = 1) were desensitized using immunoadsorption (IA) and anti-CD20 antibody induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IA was continued after transplantation and accompanied by HLA antibody monitoring and protocol biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median of 10 IA treatments, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were desensitized successfully and transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median levels of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Luminex-DSA before desensitization were 6203 and decreased after desensitization and immediately before transplantation to 891 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of seven post-transplant IA treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At last visit, after a median follow-up of 19 months, 9 of 10 patients had a functioning allograft and a median Luminex-DSA of 149 MFI; serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> was 1.6 mg/dl, and protein to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio 0.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> antibody-mediated rejection was diagnosed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One allograft was lost after the second post-transplant year in a patient with catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We describe a treatment algorithm for desensitization of living donor kidney transplant recipients that allows the rapid elimination of DSA with a low rate of side effects and results in good graft outcome </plain></SENT>
