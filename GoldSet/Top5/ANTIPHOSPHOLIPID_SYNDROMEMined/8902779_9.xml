<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As for the cofactor binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>- or gamma irradiated-plates, the endothelial binding is mediated by the so-called <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site, a cationic structure able to react with anionic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial monolayers appear to represent a substrate able to bind beta 2-GP-I and to present it in a suitable manner in order to allow the binding of anti-beta 2-GP-I beta 2 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complex between beta 2-GP-I and the respective antibodies induce an endothelial cell activation as demonstrated by the up-regulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the modulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together these findings strongly sustain a pivotal role for beta 2-GP-I in allowing antibody deposition on the endothelium and in affecting endothelial cell functions potentially responsible for a procoagulant state </plain></SENT>
