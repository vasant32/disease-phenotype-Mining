<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphatidylserine (PS) is normally sequestered in the inner leaflet of cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Externalization of PS occurs during cell activation and is essential for promoting blood coagulation and for the binding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) to cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the molecules involved in PS externalization is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated PLSCR1 expression on monocytes from APS patients and analyzed the in vitro effect of monoclonal aPL on PLSCR1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with APS were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments were performed in monocyte cell lines incubated with monoclonal aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PLSCR1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PS exposure on CD14(+) cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of full-length PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) were significantly increased in APS patients compared with healthy controls (2.4 ± 1.2 vs. 1.3 ± 0.4, respectively, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cultured monocytes, interferon alpha enhanced tissue-factor expression mediated by β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I-dependent monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monocytes in APS patients had increased PLSCR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
