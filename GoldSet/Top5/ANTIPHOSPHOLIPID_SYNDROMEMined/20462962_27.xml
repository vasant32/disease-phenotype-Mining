<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is ample evidence that beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) is the major antigen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autoantibodies recognize beta(2)GPI when bound to anionic surfaces and not in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We showed that beta(2)GPI can exist in at least 2 different conformations: a circular plasma conformation and an "activated" open conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also showed that the closed, circular conformation is maintained by interaction between the first and fifth domain of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By changing pH and salt concentration, we were able to convert the conformation of beta(2)GPI from the closed to the open conformation and back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the activated open conformation, a cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> in the first domain becomes exposed that enables patient antibodies to bind and form an antibody-beta(2)GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that the open conformation of beta(2)GPI prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time when added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma, whereas the activated partial thromboplastin time is further prolonged by addition of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conformational change of beta(2)GPI, and the influence of the autoantibodies may have important consequences for our understanding of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
