<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of patients with APS who were followed up from 1980 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, only those who fulfilled the Sydney criteria for APS were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS that manifested with PH were called the PHAPS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rest of the patients with APS served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations were compared between the PHAPS group and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients fulfilled the criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen experienced PH and were included in the PHAPS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five percent of the patients with PHAPS and 22% of the controls had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy morbidity occurred in 87.5% and 32.5% of the patients with PHAPS and controls (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent and 83% of the patients with PHAPS had high-titer immunoglobulin γ (IgG) anticardiolipin and β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I IgG antibodies compared to 43% and 30% of the controls (p = 0.002, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with PHAPS were more likely than controls to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, and pregnancy morbidity as well as high-titer APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PHAPS seems to be a unique subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with APS </plain></SENT>
