<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rapid, sensitive and specific flow cytometric assay has been developed for the determination of autoantibodies directed against platelet anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method is based on demonstrable competition between the placental <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein I, annexin V, and the patients' autoantibodies on the platelet anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (the binding site for the prothrombinase complex; prothrombin and factors Va and Xa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method is practical and rapid, uses readily available reagents, and involves standard equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay is inexpensive and cost-effective for both single and multiple samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results are provided within 2 hours from obtaining blood samples, thereby supporting clinical decision-making and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten serum samples from patients with the clinical diagnosis of APLAS (48 tests), 10 from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (35 tests), and 10 from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (33 tests) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet preparations preincubated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera showed high binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labeled annexin V with an average fluorescence of 202.9 +/- 22.0 (arbitrary units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> exhibited similar results, with an average fluorescence of 192.5 +/- 32.1 (P &gt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, incubation with sera from patients with APLAS resulted in a marked decline in the binding of annexin V to an average fluorescence of only 14.6 +/- 7.4 (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preincubation with annexin V followed by the addition of patients' sera showed displacement of annexin V to a similar degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because annexin V attenuates procoagulant activity by competing with factors Va and Xa on the platelet anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, its displacement by patients' antibodies may result in the acceleration of procoagulant activity, thereby promoting thrombogenesis in APLAS </plain></SENT>
