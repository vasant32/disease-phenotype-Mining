<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While developing an ELISA to detect anti-prothrombin autoantibodies in patient serum or plasma, no or very low signal was observed using human prothrombin immobilized on plain <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the same LA-positive samples bound specifically to prothrombin coated on gamma-irradiated plates, depending on the radiation dose, in the absence of added calcium and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optimization of the assay required the addition of 0.1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween 20</z:chebi> to the buffers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody specificity for immobilized prothrombin was ascertained by competition using liposome-bound prothrombin, since fluid-phase prothrombin competed poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven of 139 patients (55.4%) with LA related to a variety of underlying diseases possessed anti-prothrombin antibodies (27 IgG, 35 IgM and 15 both isotypes), either isolated or more often associated with anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included 67-71% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and related disorders, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome or drug-induced LA (autoimmune groups), but only 19-20% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As previously shown for anti-beta 2GPI antibodies, IgG2 was the predominant IgG subclass reactive with prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, autoimmune patients with LA have a high incidence of antibodies to beta 2GPI and prothrombin, the binding of which could similarly require high antigen density and/or exposure of cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> resulting from protein interaction with an irradiated (i.e. more anionic) <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
