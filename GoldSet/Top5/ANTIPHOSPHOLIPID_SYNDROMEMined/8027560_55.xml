<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report that the monoclonal ACLA that were shown previously by us to induce APLS stimulate mononuclear cells to generate a potent <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> resembled tissue factor (TF) in that it accelerated clotting through the extrinsic coagulation pathway, was abolished by phospholipase C, and was inhibited by anti-TF mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of TF-like activity by ACLA in monocytes was dose- and time-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was induced in monocytes and monocytic cell lines, but not in lymphoid or myeloid cells, and did not require T lymphocytes for expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The generation of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> was dependent on protein synthesis inasmuch as it was prevented by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi> to the system and was not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
