<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two kinds of plasmid expression vectors which expressed beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta 2GP1) and the fifth domain of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta 2GP1-D5) were constructed respectively in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antigenicity of recombinant beta 2GP1 (r beta 2GP1) and beta 2GP1-D5 (r beta 2GP1-D5) was identified by immunoblots using rabbit anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies, and the recombinant proteins were purified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both anti-r beta 2GP1 and anti-beta 2GP1-D5 antibodies in 112 patients were detected by ELISA using r beta 2GP1 and r beta 2GP1-D5 as coating antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant statistical correlation (r = 0.667, P &lt; 0.01) between the levels of anti-beta 2GP1 and anticardiolipin (ACL) antibodies was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies was associated with an increased frequency of history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e>; hence anti-r beta 2GP1 assay provided better specificity than conventional ACL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection of anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies may be of potential value in evaluating the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or symptoms associated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of anti-r beta 2GP1 from the sera of patients with APS to r beta 2GP1 was inhibited by r beta 2GP1-D5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, of 28 patients who had positive anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies in sera, 27 (96.4%) had positive anti-r beta 2GP1-D1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of beta 2GP1 may be located in its fifth domain </plain></SENT>
