<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The management of modifiable thrombotic risk factors can be an alternative and safer strategy, considering that many vascular events occur in the presence of concomitant non-aPL triggering conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether primary prophylaxis with aspirin may be useful for some subsets of aPL patients at particularly high thrombotic risk, such as those with overt systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> or with special patterns of antibodies ('triple positivity'), remains to be established </plain></SENT>
