<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibody</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">Acetylsalicylic Acid</z:chebi> (APLASA) study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which asymptomatic, persistently aPL-positive individuals were randomized to receive a daily dose of 81 mg of aspirin or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a separate observational and parallel study, asymptomatic, persistently aPL-positive individuals who were taking aspirin or declined randomization were followed up prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the APLASA study, 98 individuals were randomized to receive aspirin or placebo (mean +/- SD followup period 2.30 +/- 0.95 years), of whom 48 received aspirin and 50 received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the observational study, 74 nonrandomized individuals were followed up prospectively (mean +/- SD followup period 2.46 +/- 0.76 years); 61 received aspirin and 13 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the APLASA study, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> incidence rates were 2.75 per 100 patient-years for aspirin-treated subjects and 0 per 100 patient-years for the placebo-treated subjects (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.56) (P = 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the observational study, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> incidence rates were 2.70 per 100 patient-years for aspirin-treated subjects and 0 per 100 patient-years for those not treated with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in either study had concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk factors and/or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that asymptomatic, persistently aPL-positive individuals do not benefit from low-dose aspirin for primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prophylaxis, have a low overall annual incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and develop vascular events when additional <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk factors are present </plain></SENT>
