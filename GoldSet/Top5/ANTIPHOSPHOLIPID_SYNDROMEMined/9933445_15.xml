<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes were also included in the study, as it has been demonstrated that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> diseases have serum anti-lymphocyte antibodies cross-reacting with brain antigens, and intrathecally synthesized anti-neurone antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme digestion of the product obtained demonstrated the presence of beta2-GPI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types here tested, cultured both in presence and absence of fetal calf serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both culture conditions, the same cell types were immunoreactive to an anti-beta2-GPI MoAb, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate a direct cell synthesis of beta2-GPI, suggesting an antigenic function of beta2-GPI in the APS, including the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease that occurs in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
