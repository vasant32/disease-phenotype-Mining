<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no studies assessing changes over time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to determine whether there are changes over time in valvular lesions as detected by serial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with a first TEE had a second evaluation after a mean period of 13.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 10 women and two men with a mean age of 38 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TEE on both initial and follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (83%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo>, predominantly of the mitral and aortic valves in both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities consisted of thickening, nodules, regurgitation, regurgitation and stenosis, and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type and frequency of lesions changed over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As an example, one mitral valve nodule disappeared on follow up but three new aortic nodules developed even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients with mitral and aortic nodules presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mitral valvuloplasty was performed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with PAPS resolve, appear, or persist irrespective of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regurgitation is often mild or moderate, but stenosis may appear </plain></SENT>
