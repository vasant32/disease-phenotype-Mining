<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequency, demographic features, and acquired and inherited factors of in-patient cases of VTE in Peking union medical college hospital from 1994 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-two patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, male to female ratio was 1.2 and the median age was 53 (14 - 92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and eighty (86.3%) patients were at their first diagnosis with the peak ages between 40 and 50 for men and 50 and 60 for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More common acquired risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) (32.0%), trauma / surgery (31.1%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (17.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>35.7% of the patients had multiple acquired risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, the activities of protein C (PC), protein S (PS) and antithrombin (AT) were measured in 94 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The deficiency of these three natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> was 44.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> deficiencies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> was the commonest one (13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined deficiency of PC and AT accounted for 10.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>31.6% of the 94 patients had inherited plus acquired risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age for the first event of VTE in the men was about 10 years ahead of that in the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The major acquired risk factors were APS, trauma/surgery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, and inherited risk factors were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> and PC + AT combined deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It seems that the coexistence of multiple risk factors plays an important role in triggering VTE </plain></SENT>
