<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three patients suffering from systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), with different extent of skin involvement, were retrospectively examined to investigate the correlations between clinical manifestations and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aCL of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes were measured in the patients' sera by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL were found in 26 patients (25.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between aCL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patient showed the clinical picture of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical manifestations, a protocol for disease score was drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with IgG-aCL and with IgA-aCL showed a disease score higher than aCL negative patients (p = 0.008 and p = 0.022 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the finding of aCL can be considered a useful serological index for the most severe forms of SSc </plain></SENT>
