<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data accumulated over the past few years have suggested a possible correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a clear association has been established between fetal loss and certain thrombophilic states, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndromes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, and combined defects, reports on the prevalence of inherited prothrombotic defects such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T polymorphism in fetal loss are contradictory </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In light of this, the present study looked at the prevalence of these mutations in 85 patients with spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> and 31 controls </plain></SENT>
