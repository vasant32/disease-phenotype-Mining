<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) have a detrimental effect on human extravillous trophoblast (EVT) differentiation into giant multinucleated cells "in vitro." DESIGN: The EVT were isolated from the placental chorion using enzymatic digestion and Percoll gradient centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 24, 36, and 48 hours in culture, giant multinuclear cells (GMC) were identified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to cytokeratin 7 and counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: An academic research laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Placentas were donated by women having an elective cesarean section for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): This model was then used to investigate the effect of two different monoclonal aPL to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (IIC5 and ID2), and control mouse IgG antibody on EVT differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Freshly isolated EVT were nonproliferative but moved together losing their intervening cell walls and differentiated into GMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal numbers of GMC were detected after 48 hours of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aPL, IIC5, and ID2 significantly inhibited GMC formation, whereas the mouse IgG control had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can inhibit EVT differentiation and GMC formation "in vitro" suggesting that a failure of trophoblast differentiation and subsequent uteroplacental development may be an underlying pathology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-associated pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
