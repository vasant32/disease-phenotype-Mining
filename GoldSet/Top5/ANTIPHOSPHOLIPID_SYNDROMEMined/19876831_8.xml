<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The survival of the baby and its associated placenta is dependent upon the placenta shielding the embryo/fetus from harm, e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> - <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, while simultaneously providing for the passage of critical nutrients (e.g., amino acids, vitamins) and beneficial immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a number of instances, the movements of macromolecules into and through the placenta can result in the passage of the intact molecules into the fetal circulation or in the case of proteins - catabolism to amino acids which are utilized by the placenta and the fetus for continued growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transfer of two such macromolecules, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17439">cyanocobalamin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>), are examined as to the unique receptor-mediated transfer capability of the human placenta, its transfer specificity as related to specific receptors and the role of endogeneous placental proteins (trancobalamins) in facilitating the recognition and transport of specifically <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brief comparisons will be made to other animal species and the differences in specific organ transfer capabilities </plain></SENT>
