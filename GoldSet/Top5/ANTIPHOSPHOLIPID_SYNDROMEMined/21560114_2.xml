<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To construct a humanized mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) that resembles the human disease in order to define the pathophysiology and targets for treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We infused peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients into BALB- RAG-2-/- IL-2Rγ-/- double-knockout (DKO) mice, which lack T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PBMCs from 5 SLE patients and 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors were infused intravenously/intraperitoneally at a density of 3-5×10(6) cells per animal into nonirradiated 4-5-week-old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the engraftment of human CD45+ cells and monitored the plasma levels of human IgG, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> (anti-dsDNA) antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and kidney histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was 100% successful engraftment in 40 DKO mice infused with human PBMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the PBMC fraction from SLE PBMC-infused DKO (SLE-DKO) mice and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor PBMC-infused DKO (ND-DKO) mice, an average of 41% and 53% human CD45+ cells, respectively, were observed at 4 weeks postengraftment, with 70-90% CD3+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were fewer CD3+CD4+ cells (mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 5.5±2.1%) and more CD3+CD8+ cells (79.4±3.6%) in the SLE-DKO mice as in the SLE patients from which the PBMCs were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD19+ B cells and CD11c+ monocytic cells were found in the spleen, lung, liver, and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in plasma levels of human IgG and anti-dsDNA antibodies between SLE-DKO and ND-DKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of aCL were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE-DKO mice infused with PBMCs from an SLE patient who had high titers of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SLE-DKO mice had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, human IgG deposits in the kidneys, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>shorter life span</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In SLE-DKO mice engrafted with PBMCs from the aCL-positive patient, we found microthrombi and infiltration of CD3+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells in the glomeruli, recapitulating the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We established a novel humanized SLE-DKO mouse exhibiting many of the immunologic and clinical features of human SLE </plain></SENT>
