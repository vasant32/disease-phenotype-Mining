<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it has been suggested that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> can be an antigenic target of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-platelet factor 4-induced antibodies (HPIA) in 33 patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, 25 with anticardiolipin antibodies, 21 with anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, and 18 with antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>20 patients had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 19 had received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the last 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found 7 (21.2%) who had HPIA; 5 of them also had anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and suspicion of HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, two presented high positive HPIA results, one of them with positive platelet aggregation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The third patient showed grey zone HPIA and borderline aggregation test and the fourth one had negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients without a history of HIT, 2 who had never received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> presented high positive, one a moderate positive, and one a grey zone HPIA result; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them with negative aggregation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five positive sera samples were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> liposomes in the presence of beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, and whereas an inhibition greater than 50% was achieved in anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I activities, HPIA results did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that HPIA could be frequently found in patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They are responsible for HIT in some cases but can also be found in patients who have not received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether they predispose patients with aPL to HIT is not known; nevertheless, a close follow-up of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment in these patients seems to be mandatory </plain></SENT>
