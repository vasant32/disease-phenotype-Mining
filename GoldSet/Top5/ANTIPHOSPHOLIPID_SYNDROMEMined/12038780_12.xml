<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective cross sectional study of the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) in 68 ET patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to 200 "elderly" controls (&gt;50 years) there was a significant increase in anticardiolipin IgM (p &lt; 0.0001) and anti beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) IgM (p &lt; 0.0001) antibodies in ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in 10/20 with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and 12/48 without, p = 0.04, relative risk 2.0 (95% confidence intervals 1.03-3.86): these patients did not differ in terms of other clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with dual <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> (6/7) was significant when compared to those with single <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> (p = 0.02) and the remaining patients (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also anti-beta2GP1 IgM antibodies either alone, or in combination with another <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in ET and their influence upon thrombotic risk merit investigation in a larger study </plain></SENT>
