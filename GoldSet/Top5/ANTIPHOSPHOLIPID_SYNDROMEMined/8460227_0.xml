<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most well-studied clinical manifestation is <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> involving multiple sites is also well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six cases of thrombo-occlusive disease were observed in 22 patients over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography were used to make the diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who underwent angiography or venography developed thrombolytic disease related to the puncture site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome had a wide distribution of arterial and venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiologists should consider <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome in the differential diagnosis when evaluating thrombo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> that is unexpected or occurs without risk factors </plain></SENT>
