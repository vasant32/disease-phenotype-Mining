<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 141 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were divided into four groups: aCL single positive (25 cases), LA single positive (11 cases), aCL and LA double positive (25 cases), aCL and LA double negative (80 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was higher in aCL and LA double positive patients (21/25 cases, 84.0%, P &lt;0.01) than that in aCL single positive patients (4/25 cases, 16.0%), LA single positive patients (1/11 cases, 9.1%) and double negative patients (3/80 cases, 3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in these double positive patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (10/10 cases) with a high positive level of aCL (&gt; 10 units/ml) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, whereas only 2/15 patients (13.3%) with a low positive level of aCL (3-10 units/ml) were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was frequently found in the low positive group (9/15 cases, 60.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, none of 105 LA negative patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and only seven (6.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that a high aCL activity combined with a LA positive result might be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
