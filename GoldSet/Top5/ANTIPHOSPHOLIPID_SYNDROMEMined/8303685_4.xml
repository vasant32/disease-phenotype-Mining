<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel method for the purification of aPL, in which pure CL is immobilized on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> beads by hydrophobic interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> contamination was present in eluates, and the system could be reutilized three times without loosing extracting capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A marked decrease in aCL and LA activities was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient plasmas after the passage through a CL-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25657">octyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both activities were recovered in eluates which contained beta 2-GP-I and IgGs. beta 2-GP-I was also present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma eluates, which showed no aCL and slight LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method represents an improvement in the purification of aPL, and could be useful in explaining the mechanism of action of antibodies that are obtained using pure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> as extracting matrix </plain></SENT>
