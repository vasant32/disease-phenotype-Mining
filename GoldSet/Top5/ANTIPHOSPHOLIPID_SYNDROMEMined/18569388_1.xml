<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> associated with APS occurs at a younger age than typical atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease, is often recurrent, and is associated with high positive IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (GPL) unit levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the frequency rates of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) dependent on the presence of beta(2)-GPI, anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta(2)-GPI), and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine (aPS) IgG autoantibodies among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and thus demonstrate the importance of testing for abeta(2)-GPI autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and control subjects recruited from Mosul, Erbil, and Dohuk provinces in Northeren Iraq between March 2004 and March 2005 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were under 50 years-of-age and had no recognizable risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA to evaluate the presence of IgG isotype of aCL, abeta(2)-GPI, and aPS autoantibodies in their blood, the results indicated that the frequency of abeta(2)-GPI was 14/50 (28%), aCL was 11/50 (22%), and aPS was 9/50 (18%) among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, aCL was detected in 2/30 (6.7%) of control subjects; each of the other anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (APLA) was never observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the abeta(2)-GPI(+) cases, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients having the combined profile of abeta(2)-GPI + aCL was 11/14 (78.6%) and of abeta(2)-GPI + aPS was 9/14 (64.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 2/14 (14.3%) of these abeta(2)-GPI(+) patients also expressed aCL in the absence of aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of patients expressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three markers was only 9/14 (64.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In none of the APS/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were aCL or aPS expressed in the absence of the abeta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, abeta(2)-GPI as a sole marker was seen in 3/14 (21.4%) of these patients (i.e., in absence of either other marker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded from these studies that the among the three major forms of APLA examined, the presence of abeta(2)-GPI IgG autoantibodies appeared to correlate best with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients who were concurrently suffering APS </plain></SENT>
