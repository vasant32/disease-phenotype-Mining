<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of three familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>-related MEFV gene mutations (M694V, V726A and E148Q) were investigated in 70 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Organ involvement, Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) damage index and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores were correlated with mutation carriage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 70 patients (15.7%) were found to carry an MEFV mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single patient harbored two mutations, E148Q and V726A, without overt familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> while the rest were heterozygous carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 11 carried an M694V mutation, four carried V726A and two carried E148Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of MEFV mutation carriers were Sephardic while non-carriers were mainly of Ashkenazi origin (72.7% vs. 45.7% and 47.4% vs. 9.1%, respectively, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was significantly earlier in MEFV carriers (27.6 ± 9.7 vs. 38.2 ± 15.5 years, in carriers vs. non-carriers, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hematologic and serologic parameters were comparable among mutation carriers and non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Febrile episodes were more common among MEFV mutation carriers (45.4% vs. 15.2%, p = 0.035) and there was a trend for excess episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo> as well (54.5% vs. 23.7%, p = 0.06 in carriers vs. non-carriers, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of secondary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome was equivalent among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, compound urinary abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> was not observed among MEFV carriers yet was present in 33.4% and 18.6% of non-carriers (p = 0.027 and 0.19, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SLICC damage index and SLEDAI activity index did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MEFV mutation carriage appears to modify the SLE disease phenotype in that it contributes to an excess of inflammatory manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo> on the one hand, while thwarting more severe renal involvement on the other </plain></SENT>
