<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the maternal response to low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during pregnancy, by estimation of plasma anti-Xa activity, at three specified gestation points and in the nonpregnant state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal, prospective, observational study was set in a tertiary referral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four women, attending consecutively, were invited to participate and gave informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each woman had a history of recurring pregnancy loss and positive preconception screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After confirmation of a viable pregnancy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects began taking 5000 IU of dalteparin once daily subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial measurement of plasma anti-Xa activity after administration of dalteparin was performed at three standard gestation points (12, 24, and 36 weeks) and in the nonpregnant state (6 weeks postpartum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peak anti-Xa levels occurred at 4 hours postbolus in pregnancy, as compared with 2 hours in the nonpregnant state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean anti-Xa levels at 12, 24, and 36 weeks' gestation were significantly reduced, at 2 hours postinjection, as compared with the nonpregnant state (P &lt;.001, P &lt;.01, P &lt;.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lowest dose-response curve was at 36 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A repeated-measures analysis of variance found a significant difference (P &lt;.05) between the 36-week group and the postterm group but not between any of the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During pregnancy, differences in the pharmacokinetics of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were observed, with an overall reduction in anti-Xa activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this study it is questionable to extrapolate dosing and lack of dose monitoring, in pregnant women, using data derived from a nonpregnant population </plain></SENT>
