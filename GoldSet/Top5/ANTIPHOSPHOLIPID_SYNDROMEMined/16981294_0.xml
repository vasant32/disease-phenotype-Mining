<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Physicians affiliated with the University of Toronto departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rheumatology, Hematology, and Obstetric Medicine who provide care to pregnant women were mailed a questionnaire that presented 6 clinical scenarios involving postpartum management of a woman at risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with (1) recurrent pregnancy loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) treated with aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) in the pregnancy; (2) 2 pregnancy losses and a low titer <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) treated with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and low molecular weight (LMW) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental insufficiency</z:mp>; (3) known APS and pregnancy loss treated with LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and delivered by cesarean section; (4) a previous 17 week fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and aPL; (5) a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> while on oral contraception; and (6) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and secondary APS with a history of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physicians were asked whether they would recommend postpartum coagulation, and if so to choose from a list of treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 71 questionnaires mailed, 44 were returned (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three physicians replied that their practices do not include patients similar to those presented in the cases and chose not to respond to the clinical scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percentages of responders recommending treatment in each scenario were 29% for Case 1, 49% for Case 2, 63% for Case 3, 41% for Case 4, 51% for Case 5, and 58% for Case 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recommendation for treatment differed among medical specialties, with rheumatologists being less likely to treat in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was selected as the treatment of choice most frequently by those recommending anticoagulation 70% (84/120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postpartum treatment recommendations for women at increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are variable across different practitioner specializations demonstrating clinical equipoise regarding therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More definitive research is needed and broader study of physicians involved in the care of these patients is planned to more accurately describe and understand the decision to treat these patients </plain></SENT>
