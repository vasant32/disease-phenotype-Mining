<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern of pregnancy loss in women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (RM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary referral center for RM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Five hundred thirty-eight subjects with RM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were treated with clexane and aspirin; some patients with uterine anomalies underwent corrective surgery, and some cases of retarded endometrium were treated with hMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy outcome, including the stage of pregnancy at which pregnancy loss occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): In women with a prothrombotic state, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> rate before the detection of fetal heart activity (early loss) in the untreated group (50%) was significantly higher than in the treatment group (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women with a uterine anomaly, the early loss rate and the later loss rate (after detection of fetal heart activity) were both increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women with retarded endometrium, women with &gt;/=6 losses, and older women (&gt;/=41 years) are more likely to have a further early loss but not a later loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): An understanding of the patterns of pregnancy loss provides further insight into the mechanism of the reproductive failure, which has implications for treatment </plain></SENT>
