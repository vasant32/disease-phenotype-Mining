<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe morbidity, organ damage, mortality, and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Descriptive analysis of 135 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were clustered according to initial event: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (AT; n = 46), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> (VT; n = 53), or pregnancy morbidity (PM; n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease progression according to initial event and prevalence of organ damage was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APS occurs among young individuals (mean age 33.3 Â± 11.9 yrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-third of the patients have APS secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or SLE-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A broad spectrum of clinical manifestations mark the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> even before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of initial presentation is preserved with regard to second event; VT is followed by VT (84%), AT is followed by AT (95%), and PM is followed by PM (88.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest morbidity is attributed to neurologic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PM is more likely to be followed by a second event, yet is associated with less organ damage than AT and VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a mean followup of 7.55 years, 29% of patients experienced organ damage and 5 died, with Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> International Collaborating Clinics score associated with increased mortality (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.60, p = 0.01, per 1-unit increase); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> occurred in 2 patients after a cumulative followup of 1020 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coexistent SLE adds significant damage in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS is a disease of young individuals, who experience increased morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neurologic damage is the most common cause of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AT at presentation as well as coexistent SLE are associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
