<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to examine whether purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from patients with LA may interfere with the ability of TFPI to inhibit ex vivo TF-induced thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endogenous thrombin potential (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>) in pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma (PNP) supplemented with IgG from either patients with LA or controls was determined in the absence or presence of recombinant TFPI (rTFPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> neutralizer, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi> was also determined in plasmas from patients with LA and controls before and after <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection in order to quantify the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-releasable TFPI in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with IgG from controls (n = 14), IgG from patients with LA (n = 28) induced a wide range of enhancing or inhibitory effects on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi> in PNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to rTFPI in PNP with IgG from patients with LA correlated inversely with thrombin generation (r(s) = 0.637, P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the relative inhibition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi> in postheparin plasmas was smaller for patients (n = 11) than for controls (n = 9) (32% vs. 68%, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the hypothesis that TFPI <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity is inhibited in some patients with LA </plain></SENT>
