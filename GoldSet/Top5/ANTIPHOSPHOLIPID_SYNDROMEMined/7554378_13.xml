<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The titres of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> correlate with disease activity and titre increases may precede disease exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that it is possible to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome) in naive mice following active immunization with human autoantibodies, namely anti-DNA and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice developed first anti-autoantibodies and, after about 4 months anti-anti-autoantibodies (Ab3), simulating auto-antibodies (Ab1) in their binding activities, and their presence was associated with the development of disease manifestations, characteristic of the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far, there is no good animal model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the current study we have immunized mice with human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> with the aim of inducing experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two separate studies 30 mice were immunized in their footpads with autoantigen-purified IgG fraction (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) from the sera of two patients with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed 3 weeks later by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> injection in PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first experiment mice immunized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> developed <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> microabscesses in the lungs after 8 months, and died after 8-15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, mice immunized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> developed after 4 months mouse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, with specificity both to PR3 and to myeloperoxidase, as well as anti-endothelial autoantibodies (AECA), as shown by radioimmunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, the immunized mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> but not haematuria, and histological sections of the lungs demonstrated mononuclear perivascular infiltration, while diffuse granular deposition of immunoglobulins was noted in the kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results point to a pathogenic role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, and confirm the importance of the idiotypic network in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
