<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This complication of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is often fatal and recurrences are very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis of CAPS includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and this distinction may be difficult, but essential, for appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasmapheresis is effective in both conditions, but anticoagulation, a mainstay in the treatment of CAPS, could be disastrous in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present the case of an elderly woman who survived two episodes of CAPS four years apart and whose clinical findings were also suggestive of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and CAPS are compared and the importance of accurate diagnosis is emphasized </plain></SENT>
