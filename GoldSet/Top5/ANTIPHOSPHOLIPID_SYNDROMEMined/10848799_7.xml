<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism of interaction between autoantibodies and beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and the experimental conditions to be used for their detection are still under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now, these interactions have been studied under static conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the interactions of purified IgG from 25 lupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive patients with immobilized beta2GPI under flow conditions by real-time analysis based on surface plasmon resonance technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensor chips were coated with purified human beta2GPI coupled to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> via amino groups at low densities (1.4, 1.8 or 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 ng beta2GPI/mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients' IgG displayed efficient binding and had the highest so-called antiphospholipid IgG levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the highest absorbance values in an anti- beta2GPI ELISA at a beta2GPI density reported to be around 12 ng/mm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of antibodies to the beta2GPI sensor chips proved to be dependent upon the IgG concentration and beta2GPI density and was inhibited by a rabbit antibody against beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar association and dissociation profiles were observed for the four efficient binders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fast rate of dissociation limited the binding of autoantibodies to beta2GPI and was highly suggestive of a monovalent association, confirmed by binding of Fab fragments under similar experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, monovalent binding of low-affinity antibodies to beta2GPI immobilized at a density as low as 1.8 ng/mm2 could be detected using surface plasmon resonance </plain></SENT>
