<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of autoantibodies to beta2-GPI and prothrombin (PT) in the inhibition of annexin V binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) and the association with clinical manifestations of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples from 59 patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (aPL) antibodies were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affinity purification of total IgG and IgG anti-ss2-GPI antibodies was performed using staphylococcal protein A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Annexin V binding to CL was significantly inhibited by 31/59 (53%) aPL+ plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between annexin V inhibition and elevated levels of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) (r = -0.62; P &lt; 0.001), IgG anti-ss2-GPI (r = -0.67; P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>001) and a weaker association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant (r = -0.27; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association with other isotypes of aCL and anti-ss2-GPI or with anti-PT of any isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with clinical manifestations of the APS there were higher levels of IgG aCL (median (range) Z score): 10.0 (0-17.6) versus 5.0 (0-16.1); P = 0.03), IgG anti-ss2-GPI (4.5 (0-11.3) versus 0.9 (0-9.7); P = 0.02) and greater inhibition of annexin V binding to CL (-3.4 (-11.4-0.6) versus -1.1 (-10.8-1.2); P = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for the laboratory assays and the presence of clinical manifestations of the APS varied between 0.38 and 4.16, with the highest values for IgG aCL (4.16), IgG anti-ss2-GPI (3.28) and annexin V inhibition (2.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments with affinity-purified IgG antibodies indicated that inhibition of annexin V binding was dependent upon the concentration of ss2-GPI and anti-ss2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that inhibition of annexin V binding to procoagulant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces is dependent upon anti-ss2-GPI antibodies and suggest a role for annexin V in the pathogenesis of the APS </plain></SENT>
