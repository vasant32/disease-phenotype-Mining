<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Endogenous retroviral sequences represent a link between <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and genetic factors that may influence the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The HRES-1 human endogenous retroviral sequence is centrally located at the 1q42 chromosomal region relative to microsatellites previously associated with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore undertook the present study to determine the haplotypes of the HRES-1 locus and their linkage to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred six patients with SLE, 82 unrelated healthy Caucasian individuals, and 70 healthy members of 34 lupus families were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRES-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed by sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsatellites were analyzed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype construction and transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) were performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 935-base interval, we detected 6 HRES-1 haplotypes that were differentially segregated in unrelated Caucasian patients and control subjects (chi(2) = 16.86, P = 0.0048) and were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the D1S225 microsatellite (P = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microsatellites D1S225, D1S235, and D1S2785 (but not D1S229) were linked to SLE by TDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, LD between HRES-1 SNPs at bases 653 and 1259 was reduced in patients with SLE (P = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HRES-1 653C/1259C-harboring alleles were associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> (P = 0.0021) and with the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> (P = 0.0323), while the 956A allele was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in patients with SLE (P = 0.0036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HRES-1 locus represents a recombination hot spot at the 1q42 chromosomal region that influences the development and disease manifestations of SLE </plain></SENT>
