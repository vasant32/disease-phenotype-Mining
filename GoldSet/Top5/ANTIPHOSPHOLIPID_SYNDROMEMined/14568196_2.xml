<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We present a case of a patient with catastrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome with unusually high concentrations of cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Troponins are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of their elevation, in the context of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> autoimmune condition of the patient, elicited a thorough investigation for the presence of interfering antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiac markers, including total CK, CK-MB, cTnI, and cTnT, were measured in this patient over a period of 14 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to rule out a possible interference, serum samples were subjected to serial dilutions and were incubated with a blocking reagent (HBR) prior to analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time release of the cardiac markers into the systemic circulation of this patient followed the typical pattern after a myocardial infraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial dilutions of the samples, and incubation with the blocking reagent revealed no indication of the presence of interfering antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly suggest that the extremely high concentrations of cTnT and cTnI in this patient were real and indicative of a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These may be the highest concentrations of cTnI and cTnT reported in the systemic circulation of a single patient </plain></SENT>
