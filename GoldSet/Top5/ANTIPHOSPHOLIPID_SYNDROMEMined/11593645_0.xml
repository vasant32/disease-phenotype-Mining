<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate cloning and expression of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta 2GP1) recognized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and to study the clinical significance of anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using reverse transcription-PCR method, two kinds of expression plasmid which expressed beta 2GP1 and the fifth domain of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta 2GP1-D5) proteins respectively were constructed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their antigenic activities were identified by immunoblots using rabbit anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-r beta 2GP1 and anti-r beta 2GP1-D5 antibodies in the 112 patents were detected by ELISA using r beta 2GP1 and r beta 2GP1-D5 as coating antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation in statistics (r = 0.667, P &lt; 0.01) between the levels of anti-r beta 2GP1 and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies was associated with an increased frequency of history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-r beta 2GP1 assay provided better specificity than conventional aCL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The binding of anti-r beta 2GP1 from the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) to r beta 2GP1 was inhibited by r beta 2GP1-D5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, of 28 patients who had positive anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies in sera, 27 (96.4%) had positive anti-r beta 2GP1-D5 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is indicated that antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of beta 2 GP1 might be located in its fifth domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Detection of anti-r beta 2GP1 antibodies may be of potential value for evaluating the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or other APS associated symptom </plain></SENT>
