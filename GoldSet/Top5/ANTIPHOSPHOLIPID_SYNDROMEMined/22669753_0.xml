<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-term health implications of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> may imply an increased risk of thrombotic events, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), rather than thrombophilic genetic defects (i.e., factor V Leiden or prothrombin G202010A mutation) in patients with RM, is a determinant of thrombotic events later in life, especially among those patients having also classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These facts may have therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of long-term thromboprophylaxis and its associated risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is a complex problem in aPL-positive patients who have not developed previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with isolated obstetric morbidity (i.e., RM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While most authors advocate the use of antithrombotic therapy only in patients with aPL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, there is no consensus as to whether patients who have not experienced yet any thrombotic event might also be given prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
