<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with clinical signs of vasculopathy were screened with capillaroscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, and its presence was evaluated in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, autoantibody profiles in high risk patients with microhaemorrhages were correlated with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 738 patients from a Rheumatology Outpatients cohort were consecutively screened with capillaroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with microhaemorrhages were selected from the total of individuals screened and tested for anticardiolipin (αCL) and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-β2GP1) Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive autoantibody profile was subsequently correlated with arterial and venous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 149 patients with various rheumatologic conditions and capillary microhaemorrhages were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid profile screening in these individuals revealed a 15.4% of newly diagnosed secondary laboratory APS. αCL antibodies and anti-β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-β2GP1 Abs were both found to independently correlate significantly with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subanalysis of the type of anti-β2GP1 Abs indicated that the correlation with thrombotic events was significant for IgG-type (p&lt;0.001) and IgM-type (p=0.051), but not IgA-type Abs (p=0.292) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with microhaemorrhages, αCL and anti-β2GP1 Abs were associated with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observation that, although IgA type-anti-β2GP1 Abs were detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, they lacked any significant association with thrombotic complications, suggests, that either the type/conformation of the autoantibodies and/or additional factors may be critical for the development of thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, capillaroscopy can aid diagnostically to screen for or verify APS in combination with other parameters </plain></SENT>
