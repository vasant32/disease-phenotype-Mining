<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the transcript and protein levels of complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and membrane cofactor protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) in the placentas of women with acquired and inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, we assessed immunohistochemistry staining of inhibitors of the complement cascade, DAF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> proteins, in the placentas of thrombophilic women.Placentas were collected from eight women with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and ten with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>.The levels of DAF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> transcripts were evaluated by qPCR, the protein level was evaluated by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a higher transcript (p &lt; 0.05) and protein (p &lt; 0.001) levels of DAF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> in the placentas of thrombophilic women than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> were localized on villous syncytiotrophoblast membranes, but the assessment of staining in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed higher expression level of proteins that control activation of complement control proteins is only seemingly contradictory to the changes observed for example in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, given the hitherto known biochemical changes associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, a mechanism in which increased expression of DAF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> in the placentas is an effect of proinflammatory cytokines, which accompanies <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, is probable </plain></SENT>
