<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively followed 343 patients after a first episode of objectively proven VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with VTE at unusual sites, older than 70 years old, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, liver or renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors for recurrence were evaluated by Cox model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of recurrent VTE was estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of recurrent VTE was 19.1% in 5 years and 30.0% in 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male sex [relative risk (RR) 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.8], spontaneous first VTE (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.0) and FII G20210A mutation (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.9-9.4) were independent risk factors for recurrent VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fibrinogen, coagulation factors VIII, IX, X and XI were measured in 200 patients and were not associated to thrombotic recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that the incidence of recurrent VTE is high in Hispanics and depends on clinical and laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this population, FII G20210A mutation may represent a specific risk factor for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of different ethnic populations in epidemiological studies of VTE as well as new approaches to the management of anticoagulation therapy in Hispanics is warranted </plain></SENT>
