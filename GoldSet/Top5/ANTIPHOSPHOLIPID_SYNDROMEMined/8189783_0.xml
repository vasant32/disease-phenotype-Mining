<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were determined with the following techniques: IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies by ELISA, lupic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> by coagulometric tests and serology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> by a reaginic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was of 29.9 years with a female/male relation of 4.1 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed clinical manifestations were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a total of 22 patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic phenomena were observed in 15 patients (42%) with predominance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the deep venous system of the limbs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was detected in 9 cases (25%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> in 3 (8%) and low or moderate titres of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> in 12 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other infrequent clinical manifestations were cardiac valve lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients (8%) had relatives with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> study demonstrated the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in 28 patients (78%), lupic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in 22 (67%) (not determined in 3 patients) and falsely positive test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> in 5 (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evolving favorably except two who died (multiple pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in one case and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the other) mortality of the series thus being 5.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen women wished to become pregnant following fetal loss and were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> in 3 cases together with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (15 to 30 mg/day) with successful pregnancies being achieved in 12 cases (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is a well differentiated clinical entity and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> should be investigated in young people presenting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or fetal loss for no apparent reason </plain></SENT>
