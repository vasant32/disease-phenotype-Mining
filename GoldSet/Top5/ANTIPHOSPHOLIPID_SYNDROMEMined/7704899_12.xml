<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of BRC on the development of two autoimmune experimental models: (i) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), induced by injection of a human anti-dsDNA monoclonal antibody (MIV-7); (ii) primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (PAPS), induced by injection of a mouse anticardiolipin monoclonal antibody (CAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BRC had a suppressive effect on in vivo autoantibody production, as well as on the appearance of other manifestations of the respective disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BRC activity seems to be nonspecific, since the same effect was demonstrated in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were supported by the in vitro nonspecific effect of CD8 cells induced in vivo by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi>, on specific lymph node cell proliferation in the presence of the pathogenic monoclonal antibodies (MIV-7 or CAM, respectively), and on the response to an irrelevant autoantigen, myelin basic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data were complemented by the nonspecific suppressive effect by the T-suppressor factor, produced by the CD8 cells, on specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake by lymph node cells from experimental SLE or PAPS in the presence of the immunizing mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Injection of CD8 cells from BRC-treated mice with SLE or PAPS abolished the disease development in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and PAPS experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a possible novel role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3181">bromocriptine</z:chebi> in downregulating autoimmune phenomena through induction of natural nonspecific CD8+ suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
