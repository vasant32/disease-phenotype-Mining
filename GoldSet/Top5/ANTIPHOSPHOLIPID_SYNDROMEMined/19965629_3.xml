<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LACs can be detected by their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> properties in thrombin generation assays, by the peak height (PH) and lag time (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the thrombotic risk in LAC-positive patients, we have expressed the LAC activity quantitatively by PH/LT calibration curves, constructed for mixtures of monoclonal antibodies against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin, spiked in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PH/LT was determined in LAC patients, with (n = 38) and without (n = 21) TECs and converted into arbitrary LAC units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LAC titers ranged from 0 to 200 AU/mL, with 5 of 59 patients being negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the positive LAC titer population (54 of 59), LAC and anti-beta2GPI immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers correlated with TECs, with odds ratios of 3.54 (95% CI, 1.0-1.7) and 10.0 (95% CI, 1.98-50.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with single or combined low titers, useful predictions on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be made only after additional measurements of soluble P-selectin and factor VII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This layered strategy yielded positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity values approximately 90% in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, LAC and anti-beta2GPI IgG titers, when combined with selected markers of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, allow a relevant thrombotic risk assessment in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LACs </plain></SENT>
