<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the course of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), the existence of vaso-occlusive lesions capable of affecting numerous organs is now well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The renal involvement attributable to primary APS, APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (APSN), corresponds to vaso-occlusive lesions of the intrarenal vessels, associating side-by-side, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> arterial and arteriolar lesions, leading to zones of cortical ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 114 lupus patients undergoing renal biopsy was undertaken to determine the following: (1) if APSN can be found in the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE); (2) if certain clinical and biologic factors can permit the prediction of the presence of APSN; and (3) if APSN is a superadded renal morbidity factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study shows the following: (1) APSN occurs in SLE (32% of patients with renal biopsies) in addition to, and independently of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>; (2) APSN is statistically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> but not with anticardiolipin antibodies; (3) APSN is associated with extrarenal APS, mainly arterial thromboses and obstetrical fetal loss, but not with the venous thromboses of APS; (4) APSN is an independent risk factor, over and above <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, that contributes to an elevated prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo>, and increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems likely that, because of its associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo>, and increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, APSN may worsen the prognosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APSN may also have therapeutic significance in that its recognition should permit a better balance between immunosuppressor and antithrombotic and/or vasoprotective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, this study suggests that APSN should be considered as an element to be included in the classification criteria of APS </plain></SENT>
