<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody (anti-beta2GPI) detection improves identification of pediatric subjects at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) were identified by anticardiolipin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> assays, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> screening in children with primary APS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), or SLE plus APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI level and isotype were determined by beta2GPI ELISA and correlated with clinical manifestations and other aPL assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred-ten subjects under 22 years of age and of mixed ethnicity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven had SLE (including 14 with APS), 25 had primary APS, 16 had SLE-like APS, 6 were healthy children with aPL detected incidentally, 4 had other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> and 2 had other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI were detected in 48% of SLE subjects and did not improve aPL detection over standard tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.014), but not with other APS manifestations, and were rarely detected in primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among subjects with APS manifesting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, anti-beta(2)GPI distinguished subjects with SLE from those with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, anti-beta2GPI detection does not improve identification of pediatric APS over that of traditional aPL assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI are rare in pediatric primary APS, but may predict evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> to SLE </plain></SENT>
