<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Saccharomyces cerevisiae is best known as the baker's and brewer's yeast, but its residual traces are also frequent excipients in some vaccines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although anti-S. cerevisiae autoantibodies (ASCAs) are considered specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, a growing number of studies have detected high levels of ASCAs in patients affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> as compared with healthy controls, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Commensal microorganisms such as Saccharomyces are required for nutrition, proper development of Peyer's aggregated lymphoid tissue, and tissue healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, even the commensal nonclassically pathogenic microbiota can trigger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> when fine regulation of immune tolerance does not work properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For our purposes, the protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was consulted, comparing Saccharomyces <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> to several molecules with a pathogenetic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thanks to the NCBI bioinformation technology tool, several overlaps in <z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">molecular structures</z:chebi> (50-100 %) were identified when yeast <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi>, and the most common autoantigens were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autoantigen U2 snRNP B″ was found to conserve a superfamily protein domain that shares 83 % of the S. cerevisiae <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28808">mannan</z:chebi> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ASCAs may be present years before the diagnosis of some associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> as they were retrospectively found in the preserved blood samples of soldiers who became affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that ASCAs' role in clinical practice should be better addressed in order to evaluate their predictive or prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
