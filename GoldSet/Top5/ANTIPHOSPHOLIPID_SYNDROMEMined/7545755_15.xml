<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intravenous gamma globulin (IVGG) treatment on the immunological and clinical manifestations of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/c mice were actively immunized with anti-DNA (MIV-7) monoclonal antibodies (Mab) or anticardiolipin (aCL, CAM) Mab, to induce experimental SLE and primary APS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks after immunization the mice were treated for 6 weeks with IVGG (whole molecule), F(ab')2, or Fc fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following studies were carried out: autoantibody profile (ELISA), clinical manifestations including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell and platelet count, immunoglobulin deposits in the kidneys, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of antiidiotypic activity to anti-DNA and aCL antibodies in the IVGG was determined by inhibition studies employing the F(ab')2 as inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following treatment with IVGG or IVGG F(ab')2, a complete clinical remission, manifested as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ESR and leukocyte counts, and lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> or immunoglobulin deposits in the kidneys in the mice with experimental SLE, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activated partial thromboplastin time, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate in the mice with experimental primary APS was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody titers in the mice decreased to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with Fc fragments had no effect upon those variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies pointed to the presence of antiidiotypic activity to anti-dsDAN and aCL antibodies in the IVGG preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with IVGG can lead to clinical and immunological remission in mice with experimental SLE and primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect may be carried out through manipulation of the idiotypic network and neutralization of pathogenic autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results may justify the use of IVGG in patients with SLE and/or APS </plain></SENT>
