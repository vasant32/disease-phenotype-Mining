<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: A total of 203 non-pregnant women affected with primary APS were evaluated for anti-thyroid antibodies; 162 non-pregnant women affected with RSA and thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> alone served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-thyroid antibodies were found in 27% of APS patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with aPL alone had higher percentages of spontaneous pregnancies (P &lt; 0.0001) and live births (P = 0.0003), when compared with patients positive for anti-thyroid antibodies alone or with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> is frequently present in APS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> and is often associated with either reduced fecundity or with poor pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thyroid antibodies should always be evaluated in women with RSA including those with aPL </plain></SENT>
