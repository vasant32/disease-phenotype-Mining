<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that ethnicity plays a role in the prevalence, isotype distribution, and clinical significance of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2-GPI) antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies have been done in Latin American populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 129 Chilean SLE patients were tested for IgG, IgM and IgA aCL and abeta2-GPI by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were reviewed with the focus on clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity for at least one isotype of aCL was found in 30% of patients, while only 10% were positive for at least one isotype of abeta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG was the most prevalent isotype for aCL (16%), and the isotype distribution was similar (4%) for abeta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, the presence of aCL was significantly associated with the presence of abeta2-GPI, but a number of samples were positive for only one antibody, some of them associated with clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACL antibodies at medium-high titers were significantly correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.0007) and fetal loss (P = 0.009); however, the sensitivity of abeta2-GPI for detecting <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss was lower than aCL (19 and 17% vs 56 and 50%, respectively), and the specificity slightly higher (91 and 90% vs 84 and 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Chilean SLE patients, aCL and abeta2-GPI antibodies are important in the evaluation of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of abeta2-GPI antibodies was limited by the low prevalence of these antibodies in comparison with other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to define the basis of the observed differences among ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
