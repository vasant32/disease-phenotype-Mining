<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>&gt;Objective: Administration of purified human IgG from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patients has not consistently caused murine pregnancy loss despite the presence of significant anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether a correlation exists between ACA activity and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> in murine pregnancy and also determined whether pooled IgG from multiple ACA-positive patients increases the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> compared with injection of single-donor IgG.Methods: Affinity chromatography followed by anisotropic ultrafiltration was used to extract and concentrate IgG from individual serum samples with and without ACA activity (ACA-positive IgG activity, 35-85 GPL versus ACA-negative IgG activity, &lt;1 GPL) and from pooled aliquots derived from the same sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On Day 8 of gestation, pregnant mice randomly received intraperitoneal injections of ACA-positive or ACA-negative, purified IgG (15 mg/mouse) or saline (1 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laparotomies were performed on day 15, and uteri were harvested for gross evaluation and histologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> were derived for each murine pregnancy (resorbed fetuses/resorbed fetuses + live pups) and compared between experimental groups.Results: A significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate was observed in ACA-positive IgG-treated animals (n = 19, 19.3%) compared with either ACA-negative (n = 5, 6.4%; P = 0.008) or saline-treated pregnancies (n = 8, 4.6%; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, differences in resorption rates among the ACA-positive IgG-treated pregnancies did not correlate with initial ACA activity of the whole serum or with antibody activity measured in the purified, concentrated IgG preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> between single donor ACA-positive IgG and pooled ACA-positive IgG revealed similar rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> (20.5 versus 17.9%, respectively) but a lower mean birth weight among non-resorbed pups in the single-donor IgG-treated pregnancies (340 versus 430 mg; P = 0.05).Conclusions: Although greater murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> resulted from ACA-positive IgG administration compared with ACA-negative IgG or saline injection, marked variability in pregnancy outcome was observed among ACA-positive animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences were not attributable to initial antibody activity in whole serum or to activity associated with the purified immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combining multiple ACA-positive sera did not augment the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> </plain></SENT>
