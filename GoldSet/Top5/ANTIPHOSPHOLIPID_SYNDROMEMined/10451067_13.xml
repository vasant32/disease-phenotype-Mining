<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Annexins (Anx) are a family of structurally related proteins that bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in a calcium dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that antibodies to Anx V, which acts as an antithrombotic protein, are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Homology between the primary structures of Anx IV and Anx V is the highest among members of the Anx family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether anti-Anx IV autoantibodies can be detected in the sera of patients with SLE and/or APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four patients with SLE/APS were divided into 3 groups: Group A, patients with SLE but no clinical or serological features of APS; Group B, patients with SLE having only serological signs of APS; and Group C, patients with clinical symptoms and serological signs of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anx IV and Anx V were prepared by recombinant technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-Anx IV, Anx V, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), and CL beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-Anx IV was found in 15.4% of Group A, 20.0% of Group B, and 21.7% of Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-Anx V was found in 3.8% of Group A, 28.0% of Group B, and 30.4% of Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were noted between anti-Anx IV titer and anti-Anx V titer (p&lt;0.001), and between anti-Anx IV titer and aCL titer (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-Anx IV and V antibodies were characterized in the sera of patients with SLE/APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher frequency of arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found in patients with anti-Anx V </plain></SENT>
