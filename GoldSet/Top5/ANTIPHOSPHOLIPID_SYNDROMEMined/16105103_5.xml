<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Sera from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women in the study were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes of antibodies against seven <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (aPLs), i.e. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, L-phosphatidylserine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17517">phosphatidylglycerol</z:chebi>, phosphatidylinositol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, phosphatidylacid as well as against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients after two and more IVF (48 and 50%, respectively), patients with three and more repeated spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> (50 and 46.5%, respectively) are associated with significantly higher serum levels of aPLs against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17115,29999">L-serine</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quarter of them were positive for three and more aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems that determination of aPLs only against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in reproductive failure is not sufficient for obstetric-gynecology diagnosis as the primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our long-ranging study (from 1998 to 2003) shows the necessity to test for a complete aPLs profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients after two and more IVF procedures, and sera from women after three and more repeated abortions are immunologically more active than sera from women after one unsuccessful IVF and sera from women after diagnostic laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This important result is very significant for future treatment </plain></SENT>
