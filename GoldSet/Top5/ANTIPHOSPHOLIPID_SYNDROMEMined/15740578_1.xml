<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, serum anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated aCL in sera from 21 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CIDP</z:e> in our hospital between 1991 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CIDP</z:e> patients with aCL (aCL+) were compared with 17 patients without aCL (aCL-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aCL+ patients displayed sensory-<z:hpo ids='HP_0007178'>motor polyneuropathy</z:hpo>, with severity and distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> resembling those in aCL- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-nuclear antibody titer of aCL+ patients were significantly higher than those in aCL- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of aCL+ patients presented clinical manifestations of primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), such as thromboses or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the aCL+ patients were older and had more complications and more severe pathologic features than aCL- patients, they responded well to steroid pulse or intravenous immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aCL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CIDP</z:e> apparently differ from 'autoimmune' aCL in APS, instead being among the autoantibodies pathologically involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CIDP</z:e> subgroups </plain></SENT>
