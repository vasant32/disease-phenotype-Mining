<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of applying a mimetic (specific for a patient-derived prothrombotic anticardiolipin antibody [aCL]) to study the homologous, disease-associated aCL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the CL15 monoclonal aCL to screen 17 phage-display <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> (corresponding to recurrent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences) and their derivatives were synthesized and analyzed for binding to CL15 and for their abilities to inhibit CL15 from binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was chosen and used to study CL15-like IgG aCL in plasma samples from patients with APS, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) but without APS, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Library screening with CL15 yielded 4 recurrent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> showed that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> CL154C reacted with antibody CL15 and inhibited binding of CL15 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, indicating that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> CL154C may be a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimetic for the CL15 aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial studies with plasma samples revealed that CL154C-reactive IgG was present (positivity defined as the mean + 3 SD optical density of the 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) in 15 of 21 APS patients and 1 of 12 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is feasible to develop a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for each immunologically and functionally distinct disease-associated aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional testing of CL154C with a larger number of APS patients and SLE patients, as well as identification of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimetics for each distinct aCL, will reveal the diagnostic potential of CL154C and other mimetics in identifying patients with aCL who are at risk of developing life-threatening <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
