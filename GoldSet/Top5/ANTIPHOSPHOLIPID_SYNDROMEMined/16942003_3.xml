<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether platelets have a primary role in the development of TE is not clear yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined platelet autoantibodies to identify a specific platelet target which is associated with platelet activation in 97 patients with a long history of detectable LA, 65 patients with TE (LA/TE+), and 32 individuals without TE (LA/TE-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was more common in the LA/TE- than in the LA/TE+ group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo>, but the frequency of antibodies was lower in LA/TE+ than LA/TE- patients (P &lt; 0.01), who had higher antibody titres against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ib/IX (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, their platelets were more activated, as determined by PAC-1 binding (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences were also noted if patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> were evaluated separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings in LA/TE- individuals were similar to those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there was no autoantibody target identifiable to distinguish between LA/TE- from LA-TE+ individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo>, even if associated with platelet activation, is not sufficient to dispose LA patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
