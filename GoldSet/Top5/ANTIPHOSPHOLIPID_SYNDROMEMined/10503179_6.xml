<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case control study with retrospective data collection and prospective pediatric review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent Miscarriage</z:e> Clinic based at a University Teaching Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Infants (n = 62) of mothers with APS, compared to 124 index cases randomly selected from the delivery register, matched for gestation and sex who delivered between 1992 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty two infants born to 55 women with APS were reviewed to study the neonatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> rate for the group was 10%, compared to 8.5% for the total hospital population over the same period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one percent (21%) had birth weights less than or equal to the 10th centile, which was not statistically significant compared to matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of dual parameter positivity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibody) for APS is clearly associated with a higher incidence of growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on neurodevelopmental and physical examination at pediatric review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was a low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of growth restriction of 21% is higher than expected it was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no developmental abnormalities on follow-up of these children </plain></SENT>
