<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the clinical significance of MetS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one primary APS patients and 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were tested for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, Lp(a), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MetS was defined by the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation criteria, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> was established using the homeostasis model assessment index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was 33.8%, and further comparison between primary APS patients with and without MetS revealed that the former had a higher frequency of arterial events (79.2% versus 42.6%; P = 0.003), <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (29.2% versus 2.1%; P = 0.002), and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> antibody (95.8% versus 76.6%; P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, primary APS patients with MetS, as expected, had a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, only MetS was independently associated with arterial events in primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coexistence of primary APS and MetS seems to identify a subgroup of patients with higher risk of arterial events, suggesting that MetS may aggravate existing endothelial abnormalities of primary APS </plain></SENT>
