<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After identifying significant aPL in sera of several index patients with 'CLD', we performed aPL tests on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients referred in whom 'CLD' was suspected, diagnosed or treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with suspected, diagnosed or treated 'CLD' and reportedly 'positive' Lyme assays were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPL testing included anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 antibodies (anti-β2GP1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into four newly described categories of CLD and data was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and six patients were evaluated, of whom 82% had neurologic symptoms and 51% rheumatologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight of 106 (83%) patients had positive Lyme serologies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] 62/106, 58.4%; western blot [WB] 64/106, 60%), while 18/106 (16.9%) were negative or equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>aPL was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 'CLD' categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>aCL and/or anti-β2GP1 were positive in 85/106 (80%), with aCL present in 69/106 (65%) and anti-β2GP1 present in 69/106 (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays, IgM isotypes predominated: WB 55/64 (85%), aCL 63/69 (91%), anti-β2GP1 52/69 (75%), aCL and/or anti-β2GP1 74/85 (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-β2GP1 assays occurred in higher titer than aCL: 36/69 (52%) versus 63/69 (91%), p&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had aPL-related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 12/106 (11.3%) had true post-Lyme syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>), category IV, or late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lyme disease</z:e> (LLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients had been treated for Lyme: 82/106 (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: aPL occurs frequently in patients with 'CLD' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IgM anti-β2GP1, IgM aCL and IgM WB were frequently found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> or LLD was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The role of aPL in patients with 'CLD' needs further investigation </plain></SENT>
