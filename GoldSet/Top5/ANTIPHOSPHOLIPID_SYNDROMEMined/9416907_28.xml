<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that human monoclonal and polyclonal anticardiolipin antibodies have thrombogenic properties in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using such a model in which these antibodies have been shown to increase both the size of an induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and the duration of time in which such a clot lasts, we investigated whether hydroxychloroquine alters the dynamics of such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three groups of nine mice were injected with purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from a patient with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS) and then fed with hydroxychloroquine at various doses (100, 6, and 3 mg/kg body wt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three control groups of mice were also studied, including mice injected with IgG-APS and then fed with placebo, as well as two other groups injected with IgG from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum and fed either hydroxychloroquine or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A standardized thrombogenic injury was subsequently induced in the femoral vein of each mouse and the area (size) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> measured as well as the total period of time that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with hydroxychloroquine and IgG-APS showed significantly smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> that persisted for a shorter period of time compared with animals treated with IgG-APS and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine significantly diminished both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size and total time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in mice previously injected with IgG-APS </plain></SENT>
