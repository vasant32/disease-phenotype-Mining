<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the contribution of antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) and prothrombin (anti-PT) to the thrombotic risk in a cohort of 194 consecutive patients with persistent LA and/or aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 45 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 39 patients (20.1%) had one documented episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these patients had no previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> before enrollment in the study and 28 had recurrences of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 21 venous and 18 arterial thrombotic events and the overall incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 5.6% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, the male sex (P = 0.025), a previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.01), the presence of anti-beta2GPI (P = 0.001), and the presence of anti-PT (P = 0.03) remained as independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only IgG anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT were associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.01 and P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients testing positive for anti-beta2GPI had a higher rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than did antiphospholipid patients without anti-beta2GPI (8.0% vs. 3.1% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a higher rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in patients with positive anti-PT compared with patients without anti-PT (8.6% vs. 3.5% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering only the group of 142 LA positive patients, the highest incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found in LA patients positive for both anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT (8.4% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of IgG anti-beta2GPI and anti-PT in patients with LA and/or aCL and mainly in those with LA predicts a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
