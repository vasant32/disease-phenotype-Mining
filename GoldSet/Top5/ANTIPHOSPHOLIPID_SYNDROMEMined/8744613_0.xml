<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then a number of individual case reports and two small series have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These have suggested an association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorders</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify the clinical and laboratory associations of anti-lamin autoantibodies in an Australian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of routine antinuclear antibody testing between 1990-1994 for characteristics linear staining of nuclear envelope on indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells with clinical status defined by retrospective review of case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were identified and the clinical status of 27 patients defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had associated IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies; anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome was present in nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven further patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>; five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune liver disease</z:e>, with associated autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining nine patients had a diverse group of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the titre of the autoantibody and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An association with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies was found although the cause remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-lamin autoantibodies, as identified by indirect immunofluorescence, are associated with a diverse group of diseases but particularly with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Testing for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies and more specific markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, for example anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies should be pursued when anti-lamin autoantibodies are detected </plain></SENT>
