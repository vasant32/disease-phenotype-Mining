<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor (TF), the major initiator of the extrinsic coagulation system, is induced on monocytes by aPL in vitro, explaining in part the pathophysiology in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an important role in aPL-induced TF expression on monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified plasma gelsolin as a protein associated with β(2) GPI by using immunoaffinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An in vivo binding assay showed that endogenous β(2) GPI interacts with plasma gelsolin, which binds to integrin a(5) β(1) through fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tethering of β(2) GPI to monoclonal anti-β(2) GPI autoantibody on the cell surface was enhanced in the presence of plasma gelsolin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that p38 MAPK protein was phosphorylated by monoclonal anti-β(2) GPI antibody treatment, and its phosphorylation was attenuated in the presence of anti-integrin a(5) β(1) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase, a downstream molecule of the fibronectin-integrin signalling pathway, was phosphorylated by anti-β(2) GPI antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that molecules including gelsolin and integrin are involved in the anti-β(2) GPI antibody-induced MAPK pathway on monocytes and that integrin is a possible therapeutic target to modify a prothrombotic state in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
