<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse data on patients who developed catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) in primary and secondary APS, to assess outcomes of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed retrospectively the data on 164 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and APS, on 76 patients with primary APS (PAPS) treated in the Institute of Rheumatology from 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Verification of vascular complications was made using ultrasonic dopplerography (UDG) of peripheral vessels, echocardiography of the heart, CT of the brain, abdominal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLab) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) served as serological markers of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the observation period of 9.4 +/- 4.2 years, 33 patients (23 females and 10 males) out of 164 patients with SLE+APS developed CAPS, 8 of them survived while 25 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAPS patients had no differences by age, duration of the disease, its activity and symptoms from patients who had no CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten out of 76 patients with PAPS developed CAPS, 7 of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the concomitant factors which may initiate PAPS showed that in SLE and APS these factors consisted of initial menopause (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n = 12), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e> (n = 3), food poisoning (n = 1), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> was in one patient, trauma after road accident in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Trigger factor was not determined in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In PAPS provoking factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (n = 2) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (n = 1), in 7 patients these factors were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in SLE patients should be adequately treated with antibiotics; APS patients treated surgically should receive parenteral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> instead of oral ones; puerperas with APS must receive adequate parenteral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for at least 6 weeks; in exacerbation of SLE, APS patients should receive parenteral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> with following hypocoagulation with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
