<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A database was established prospectively to follow-up a cohort of unselected patients who had had a first episode of objectively proven DVT under the age of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had DNA analysis for heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, malignant disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, or a requirement for long-term antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end-point was objective evidence of symptomatic DVT recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow-up was 4.07 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, the cumulative recurrence rate was 19.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of risk was not related to presence or absence of laboratory evidence of genetic polymorphisms: FV G1619A (HR 1.26 [95%CI: 0.64-2.46]; p = 0.51), FII G20210A (HR 0.81 [95%CI: 0.35-1.89]; p = 0.62), MTHFR C677T (HR 1.26 [95%CI: 0.56-2.81]; p = 0.58), PAI-1 4G/5G (0.84 [95%CI: 0.35-2.05]; p = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in young people was not related with the presence of FV G1691A, FII G20210A, MTHFR C677T or PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
