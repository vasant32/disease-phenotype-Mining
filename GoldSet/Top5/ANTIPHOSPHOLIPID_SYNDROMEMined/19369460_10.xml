<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The HISPAMEC Registry is a multicenter international study group dedicated to collecting data on patients diagnosed with SAD with serological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The information sources are cases reported by physicians of the HISPAMEC Study Group and periodic surveillance of reported cases by a Medline search updated up to December 31, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One thousand twenty HCV patients with SAD were included in the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were reported from Southern Europe (60%), North America (15%), Asia (14%), Northern Europe (9%), South America (1%), and Australia (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Countries reporting the most cases were Spain (236 cases), France (222 cases), Italy (144 cases), USA (120 cases), and Japan (95 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently reported SAD were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SS; 483 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA; 150 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE; 129 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> (78 cases), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (59 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> (39 cases), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (28 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had 2 or more SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological data were available in 677 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four hundred eighty-seven (72%) patients were female and 186 (28%) male, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 1.0 years at SAD diagnosis and 50.5 +/- 1.1 years at diagnosis of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main immunologic features were antinuclear antibody (ANA) in 61% of patients, rheumatoid factor (RF) in 57%, hypocomplementemia in 52%, and cryoglobulins in 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main differential aspect between primary and HCV-related SAD was the predominance of cryoglobulinemic-related markers (cryoglobulins, RF, hypocomplementemia) over specific SAD-related markers (anti-ENA antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-cyclic citrullinated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) in patients with HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the selected cohort, the SAD most commonly reported in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were SS (nearly half the cases), RA and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nearly two thirds of SAD-HCV cases were reported from the Mediterranean area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In these patients, ANA, RF and cryoglobulins are the predominant immunological features </plain></SENT>
