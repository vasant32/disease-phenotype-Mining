<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The atomic force microscope (AFM), invented in 1986, and a member of the scanning probe family of microscopes, offers the unprecedented ability to image biological samples unfixed and in a hydrated environment at high resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This opens the possibility to investigate biological mechanisms temporally in a heretofore unattainable resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used AFM to investigate: (1) fundamental issues in cell biology (secretion) and, (2) the pathological basis of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies have incorporated the imaging of live cells at nanometer resolution, leading to discovery of the "porosome", the universal secretory portal in cells, and a molecular understanding of membrane fusion from imaging the interaction and assembly of proteins between opposing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the development of an in vitro simulacrum for investigating the molecular interactions between proteins and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> has helped define an etiological explanation for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prime importance of AFM in the success of these investigations will be presented in this manuscript, as well as a discussion of the limitations of this technique for the study of biomedical samples </plain></SENT>
