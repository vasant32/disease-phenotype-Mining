<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are frequently observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), we assessed the risk factors for new thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six PAPS patients (mean age, 37+/-10 years) were prospectively studied for 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preliminary Sapporo classification criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS; a medium-high anticardiolipin antibody [aCL] titer and/or a positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [LA] test in the presence of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or pregnancy morbidity) were used to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic episodes or pregnancy losses before a diagnosis of PAPS were considered events, and any new disease manifestation other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was considered a recurrent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients with objectively verified thrombotic events were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one new thrombotic events were observed in 15 subjects (26.8%), including 3 (5.4%) who died during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with IgG aCL levels of &gt;40 IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> unit (GPL-U) showed a higher incidence of new thrombotic events (43.3%) than those with levels of &lt; or =40 GPL-U (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified a history of recurrent clinical events (P=0.004), a highly positive aCL titer (P=0.007), and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> (P=0.036) as significant risk factors for new thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate regression model confirmed that an IgG aCL titer of &gt;40 GPL-U was an independent risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio, 9.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.83 to 46.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high IgG aCL titer is the strongest predictor of new thrombotic events in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
