<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-&amp;beta;2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (GPI) antibodies for pregnancy morbidity in the antiphosoplipid syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 335 women were recruited and on the basis of their clinical features were subdivided into 2 groups homogenous for number and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first (study) group contained the women whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> satisfied the classification criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second (control) group was made up of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> not included in the classification criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> occurring with a significant frequency (p=0,00) in the women with pregnancy criteria for APS were the IgG anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI and the IgG aCL present respectively in 23,92% and in 27,60% of the women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its association was found to be significant (p=0,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the different levels of positivity of the IgG and IgM anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI in the patients of the study and control groups was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> was that of the IgG aCL and of the IgG anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI whose difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison of the specificity of the IgG and IgM anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI with that of the IgG and IGM aCL was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The importance of determining the IgG anti-&amp;beta;2-GPI as part of routine laboratory testing of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> typical of APS was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together with IgG aCL these antibodies have proved to be the most sensitive and specific markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in APS </plain></SENT>
