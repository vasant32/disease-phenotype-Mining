<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of serum antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus and other infectious agents in a large cohort of well-characterized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (AID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We utilized 1322 sera from patients with 18 different AID and 236 sera from healthy controls from the same countries and with similar age and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sera were tested for the presence of serum anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) antibodies as well as antibodies directed at other infectious agents and autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-HCV antibody was detected in 115/1322 (8.7%) of patients with AID and 0.4% of matched healthy controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-HCV antibody was significantly higher in 7/18 different AID (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>, mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus vulgaris</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, secondary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with AID and serum anti-HCV positivity had an increased prevalence of antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus, Toxoplasma gondii and Cytomegalovirus as opposed to a lower frequency of serum autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced prevalence of anti-HCV serum antibodies in AID may suggest a role for HCV in tolerance to breakdown, similarly to its established role in mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This immune mediated effect does not rule out the role of other infectious agents </plain></SENT>
