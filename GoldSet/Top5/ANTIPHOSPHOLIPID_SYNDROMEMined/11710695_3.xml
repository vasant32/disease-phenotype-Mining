<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OxLDL and IgG anti-oxLDL were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma samples from 80 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive values (mean + 3 SD) for oxLDL and anti-oxLDL were found in 21 (26%) and 19 (24%) of 80 patients with APS, respectively These values were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies in subgroupings of patients with APS who had experienced thrombotic events were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences among the groups for the levels of both oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pairwise comparisons between the groups yielded similar but not identical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant, positive correlation between levels of plasma oxLDL and anti-oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that elevated levels of plasma oxLDL and anti-oxLDL may be risk factors and potential markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, especially for arterial thrombotic events, in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
