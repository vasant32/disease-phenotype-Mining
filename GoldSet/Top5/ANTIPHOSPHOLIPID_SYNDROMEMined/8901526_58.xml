<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used ellipsometry to study the binding of beta 2GPI and the beta 2GPI-mediated binding of ACA to planar membranes composed of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) and 5-20 mol % phosphatidylserine (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No binding of beta 2GPI was observed to neutral (PC) membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal binding of beta 2GPI was 3.2-3.6 pmol.cm-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affinity decreased strongly with decreasing PS content; increasing the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> concentrations also led to a decrease in affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At physiologic conditions (10 mol % PS, 120 mM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, and 3 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>), a Kd of 14 microM was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding constants were insensitive to the chemical composition of the negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> headgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACA (1.25-10 micrograms.mL-1) caused a 30-40-fold enhancement of beta 2GPI binding to PS/PC membranes (20 mol % PS), resulting in the binding of about 2 pmol.cm-2 divalent ACA-(beta 2GPI)2 complexes at 100 nM beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the absence of beta 2GPI, binding of ACA was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ad- and desorption kinetics of ACA-beta 2GPI complexes indicate that the initial monovalent association of ACA to membrane-bound beta 2GPI is rapidly followed by formation of divalent ACA-(beta 2GPI)2 complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Experiments with monovalent Fab1 fragments of ACA showed no appreciable effect on the beta 2GPI binding to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, substantiating the notion that divalent interactions are essential for the high-affinity binding of ACA-beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect of ACA is rationalized by the observation that binding of ACA-beta 2GPI complexes to the PSPC membrane severely restricts the adsorption of blood coagulation factor Xa </plain></SENT>
