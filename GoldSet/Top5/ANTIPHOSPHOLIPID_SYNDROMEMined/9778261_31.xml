<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (ACL Abs) has been reported in some patients suffering from multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), especially of the "neuromyelitic" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, bright T2-imaging foci (unidentified bright objects) are occasionally detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a cohort of 100 patients with a probable or definite diagnosis of MS according to Poser's criteria, we isolated a subgroup of 20 patients (8 males and 12 females) consistently positive for ACL Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were followed up neurologically for 1 to 3 years and brain MRI scanning and a complete autoimmune screening were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (19 of 20) of our patients had the classic neuroimaging features of MS (multiple white-matter T2 bright foci on the MRI scan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common neurological syndrome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, slowly progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> (presenting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromyelitis optica</z:e>, or spinocerebellar syndrome; 15 of 20), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (6 of 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was a dominant symptom in 8 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Less common symptoms included cognitive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean levels of ACL Abs were 38.8+/-28.2 GPL (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values up to 7.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid were detected in only 3 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with acetylsalycilic acid and occasionally with short courses of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelopathic/spinocerebellar syndrome was slower than expected in MS (only 2 patients deteriorated whereas 4 improved during a mean follow-up period of 20.8+/-7.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with probable or definite diagnosis of MS, and consistently elevated levels of ACL Abs show a slower progression and some atypical (for MS) features, such as persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and absence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In these patients, other, presumably vascular, mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, management should include antiplatelet or even <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
