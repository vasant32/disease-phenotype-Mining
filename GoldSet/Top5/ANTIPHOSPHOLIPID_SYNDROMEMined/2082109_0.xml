<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed a 14% prevalence of false positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lyme disease</z:e> serology in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with PAPLS and false positive serologic tests for Borrelia burgdorferi neurological involvement was significantly more common (p = 0.012, Fisher's exact test) than in patients with PAPLS without that finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We insist on the possibility that patients with PAPLS may have false positive serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi as measured by IFI with the resulting diagnostic error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cases, confirmation by other techniques such as ELISA or immunoblotting is recommended </plain></SENT>
