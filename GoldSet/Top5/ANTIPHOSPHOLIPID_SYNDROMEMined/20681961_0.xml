<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is an autoimmune condition characterised by vascular thromboses and/or pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of APS typically requires laboratory evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on their clinical presentation, affected individuals might be seen by a variety of clinical specialities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate clinical ordering patterns for aPL/APS at a tertiary level public facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an audit of internal clinical requests for aPL tests at our institution for a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a wide variety of clinical ordering background for aPL, of predominantly obstetric (72/268; 26.9%) or thrombophilic (78/268; 29.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 11/268 samples (4.1%) were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and 14/268 (5.2%) were positive for anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of aCL positivity in the LA-positive group was 46% (5/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the 72 obstetric patients tested was identified to have aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 LA-positive patients, the reasons identified for testing comprised: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time</z:hpo> (assay) (n= 3), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n= 3), APS (n= 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (n= 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (n= 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We determined a wide variety of clinical ordering background for aPL at a tertiary level institution, with an overall low rate (&lt;10%) of aPL positivity among a hospital population of predominantly obstetric or thrombophilic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>That no positive obstetric aPL cases were identified suggests local clinical ordering guidelines may need review, as also potentially practised at other institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also observed a moderate rate (46%) of coincidence of aCL and LA, in agreement with guidelines indicating that multiple tests are required to identify APS </plain></SENT>
