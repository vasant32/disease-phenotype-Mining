<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the FcgammaRIIA-R/H131 polymorphism on the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), both primary and secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This international meta-analysis combined data from 9 research teams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FcgammaRIIA-R/H131 genotypes were determined in 481 APS cases (206 with primary APS), 1,420 SLE controls, and 1,655 disease-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were combined using fixed-effects and random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with disease-free controls, the RR genotype was enriched in the entire group of APS cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.28-2.14); this was driven mostly by patients with secondary APS (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.45-2.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The excess of RR homozygotes but not heterozygotes among APS patients suggested a recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, rather than the additive model seen for SLE susceptibility, where RR conferred greatest risk, and RH intermediate risk, for SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This probably reflected the additional influence of another opposing genetic effect of HH homozygosity on APS predisposition (OR 0.72 for RH versus HH, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among SLE patients, those with APS were more frequently HH homozygotes than heterozygotes (OR 0.56 for RH versus HH, 95% CI 0.39-0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HH homozygosity also tended to predominate in primary APS compared with secondary APS (OR 0.50 for RR versus HH, 95% CI 0.25-0.99 by fixed-effects model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for any of these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FcgammaRIIA-R/H131 polymorphism is an important determinant of predisposition to APS, with different influences on SLE and APS susceptibility per se </plain></SENT>
