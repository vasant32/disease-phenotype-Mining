<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different pathogenic mechanisms for aPL-mediated pregnancy failure have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular a direct effect of aPL on both maternal and fetal side of the placental tissue has been reported, since their reactivity with β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2GPI) makes them adhere to trophoblast and human endometrial endothelial cell (HEEC) membranes. β2GPI can be recognized by aPL that, once bound, interfere with both trophoblast functions and with the HEEC differentiation.APS patients can be successfully treated with Low Molecular Weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that LMWH acts through mechanisms alternative to its well known <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect, because of its ability to bind β2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, we showed that LMWH is able to reduce the aPL binding to trophoblasts and restore cell invasiveness and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So far, however, no study has described its effects on endometrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>.The aim of our research was to evaluate whether two LMWHs, tinzaparin and enoxaparin, have an effect on the aPL-inhibited endometrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to investigate: (i) in vitro HEEC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> through a Matrigel assay; (ii) VEGF secretion by ELISA; (iii) matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity by gelatin zymography; (iv) Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity by colorimetric assay; (v) STAT-3 activation by a sandwich-ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, using an in vivo murine model we investigated the LMWHs effects on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>.We demonstrated that the addition of LMWHs prevents aPL-inhibited HEEC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to restore the aPL inhibited NF-κB and/or STAT-3 activity, the VEGF secretion and the MMPs activity.The demonstration of a beneficial role for LMWHs on the aPL-inhibited HEEC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> might provide additional mechanisms whereby this treatment protects early pregnancy in APS </plain></SENT>
