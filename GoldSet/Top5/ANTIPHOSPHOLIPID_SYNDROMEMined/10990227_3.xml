<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, in particular those with specificity for beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI), on in vitro thrombin generation, and examined the association with clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied plasma samples from 59 patients with aPL antibodies determined by the presence of either elevated anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct antibody binding of IgG, IgM, and IgA to beta2-GPI and prothrombin (PT) was determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affinity purification of total IgG and IgG anti-B2-GPI antibodies was performed using staphylococcal protein A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A chromogenic assay was used to determine the effect of plasma samples and purified autoantibodies on in vitro thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three of 59 (56%) plasma samples inhibited in vitro generation of thrombin and 7/59 (12%) accelerated thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a strong negative correlation between thrombin generation and IgG aCL (r = -0.72, p &lt; 0.001) and IgG anti-beta2-GPI (r = -0.71, p &lt; 0.001) antibody levels, and a weaker correlation with LAC (r = -0.46, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was not found with anti-PT antibodies and could not be attributed to concurrent therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments with affinity purified IgG antibodies indicated a dose dependent inhibition of thrombin generation, which was restricted to anti-beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of core clinical manifestations of the APS [venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, recurrent (&gt; or = 2) fetal loss] had significantly greater inhibition of in vitro thrombin generation (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> Z score: -3.38 +/- 0.51 vs -1.42 +/- 0.56; p = 0.01) and higher levels of IgG aCL (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> Z score: 8.39 +/- 1.12 vs 5.39 +/- 0.88; p = 0.04) and IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> Z score: 4.49 +/- 0.69 vs 2.26 +/- 0.54; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for these variables and clinical manifestations of the APS were 5.43, 4.17, and 3.28, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: aPL antibodies may accelerate or inhibit the rate of in vitro thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predominant effect is inhibition that is restricted to IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibodies and it is strongly associated with clinical manifestations of the APS </plain></SENT>
