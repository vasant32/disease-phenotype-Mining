<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy in APS patients markedly increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no data on pregnancy outcome in patients with APS with a history of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with three APS patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who had successful pregnancies and deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Three patients with APS and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with small doses of aspirin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients remained free of attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during their pregnancies and at follow-up periods of 1 to 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Successful pregnancy and delivery is possible in APS patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, treated with low-dose aspirin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A previous episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> should not be considered an absolute contraindication for an APS patient to become pregnant </plain></SENT>
