<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied clinical significance of antibodies to beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta 2-GPI) in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>69 patients with verified SLE were examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>44(65%), 46(67%), 49(71%), 19(28%), 16(23%) patients were positive for LA, IgG-aCL, IgM-aCL, IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI and IgM-anti-beta 2-GPI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperproduction of IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI correlated with APS development as a whole, its separate clinical symptoms (venous and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, obstetric pathology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) and some comcomitant clinical signs (trophic crural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1710615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">valvular heart disorders</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an increase in concentration of IgM-anti-beta 2-GPI was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both isotypes of anti-beta 2-GPI occurred more frequently in the sera positive by LA and aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that we discovered IgG-anti-beta 2-GPI more often in early than late postthrombolytic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, anti-2b2-GPI is a new serological marker of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its detection is clinically important for upgrading diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
