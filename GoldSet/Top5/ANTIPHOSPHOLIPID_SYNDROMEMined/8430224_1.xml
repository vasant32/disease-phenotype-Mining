<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed this observation as a contributing factor to thrombogenesis in women with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) is an accepted therapeutic alternative in these patients, we sought to determine if <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> would attenuate endothelial cell PAF production resulting from ACA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using primary, confluent monolayers of umbilical vein endothelial cells, experiments were performed to evaluate PAF synthesis after incubation with antibody-positive serum and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total PAF and its radyl-derivatives (1-alkyl- and 1-acyl-PAF) were quantified by tritiated <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> incorporation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> extraction, thin-layer chromatography and scintillation spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> consistently decreased ACA-induced PAF synthesis (No <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, 9573 +/- 443 vs 1mmol/L <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, 4829 +/- 838 dpm/ml; p = 0.016) and the observed reduction was dose-dependent over a range of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 mmol/L; ANOVA, p = .00015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced PAF synthesis was also observed in cultures exposed to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and incubated with antibody-negative serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that in ACA-positive women, the antithrombotic effects of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> may relate in part, to reduced endothelial cell PAF synthesis </plain></SENT>
