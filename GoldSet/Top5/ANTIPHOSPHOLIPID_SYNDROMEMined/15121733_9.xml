<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> and known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) were followed through pregnancy in an ethically approved prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women had dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) performed within 6 months prior to conception and in the immediate post-natal period, within 6 weeks of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMWH (5000 U/day) plus low-dose aspirin was commenced after a positive urine pregnancy test and continued throughout pregnancy and after delivery until 6 weeks post-partum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of 20 volunteers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e>, not requiring any treatment intervention, acted as controls and were monitored in an identical fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Characteristics were not significantly different between treated patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups showed a similar loss in lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD by the end of the pregnancy [LMWH 4.17% or 0.045 g/cm(3), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.036-0.062 versus control 3.56% or 0.043 g/cm(3), 95% CI 0.027-0.059] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the difference in bone loss between the groups was not statistically significant (0.002 g/cm(3), CI -0.0124 to 0.00865; P = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered vertebral fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone loss associated with the use of long-term LMWH is not significantly different from physiological losses during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
