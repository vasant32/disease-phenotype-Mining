<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of 30 patients consecutively diagnosed of PAPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Episodes of ACVA were quantitated and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients (9/30) had one or more ACVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found when the presence of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in both groups was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in young patients with ACVA should be determined, although some other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> may coexist </plain></SENT>
