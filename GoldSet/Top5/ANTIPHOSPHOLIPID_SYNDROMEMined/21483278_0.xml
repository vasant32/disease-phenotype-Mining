<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients, during and after specific multidrug therapy (MDT), and to evaluate a possible association between these antibodies and some clinical characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>, including clinical forms, reactional episodes and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 158 leprosy patients, 129 gender-and-age matched healthy individuals, and 38 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients were collected, and serum samples, obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, were kept frozen at - 20°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies were measured either by an in house-developed ELISA (aCL) or by a commercial ELISA (anti-β2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients and in the APS group, however, in contrast to APS, the predominant isotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> was IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients than in healthy individuals (15.8% vs. 3.1%; p&gt;0.01; 46.2% vs. 9.4%, p&gt;0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lepromatous form predominated among aCL positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients (p&gt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in aCL and anti-β2GPI positivity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients taking MDT and those completed MDT as cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the duration of discharged period (period between discharge from MDT and the realization of the study) had no effect on anti-β2GPI positivity, and a slight increase in aCL positivity was observed in patients with longer follow up periods (p=0.04), suggesting that the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) was not a transient phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although aPL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> were frequent and β2GPI-dependent as those found in APS, IgM was the predominant isotype, and there was no association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or other APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
