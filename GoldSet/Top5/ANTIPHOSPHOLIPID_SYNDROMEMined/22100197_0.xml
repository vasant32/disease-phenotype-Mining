<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of APS, the presence of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin or anti-Î²2-glycoprotein1 antibodies of IgG or IgM isotype is required through laboratory testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other autoantibodies such as antiphosphatidylethanolamin or antiphosphatidylserin/prothrombin complex antibodies may be interesting in the diagnosis of APS when common <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These autoantibodies are still under evaluation for their diagnostic contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite numerous attempts, the assays that are available for the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have not been standardized yet, which leads to high variability between reagents and laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, to optimize the biological monitoring of APS syndromes, it is mandatory to have consecutive samples analyzed in the same laboratory </plain></SENT>
