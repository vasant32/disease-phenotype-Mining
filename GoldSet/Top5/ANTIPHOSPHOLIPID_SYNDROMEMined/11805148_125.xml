<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of fetal loss and tissue injury in APS is incompletely understood, but is thought to involve platelet and endothelial cell activation as well as procoagulant effects of aPL antibodies acting directly on clotting pathway components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that uncontrolled complement activation in the placenta leads to fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in utero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that aPL antibodies activate complement in the placenta, generating split products that mediate placental injury and lead to fetal loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used a murine model of APS in which pregnant mice are injected with human IgG containing aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that inhibition of the complement cascade in vivo, using the C3 convertase inhibitor complement receptor 1-related gene/protein y (Crry)-Ig, blocks fetal loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mice deficient in complement C3 were resistant to fetal injury induced by aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While antigenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by aPL antibodies are important in the pathogenesis of APS, our data show that in vivo complement activation is required for aPL antibody-induced fetal loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
