<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In severe cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), microthrombosis can occur similar to that seen in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, suggesting possible mutual pathogenic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of ADAMTS13 in APS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that aberrations in ADAMTS13 may occur in APS and evaluated ADAMTS13 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF) in 68 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPA) including 52 with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three (49%) had IgG anti-ADAMTS13 with 12 of these patients having reduced ADAMTS13 activity, suggesting neutralising antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low ADAMTS13 activity (median 34%) was demonstrated in 22/68 (33%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ADAMTS13 antigen levels consistent with dysfunctional ADAMTS13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduced ADAMTS13 activity was not secondary to elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF), or increased VWF secretion (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VWF propeptide), although a reduced VWF clearance was noted in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis found no associations between the ADAMTS13 abnormalities and any aPA profile or thrombotic/obstetric complications, although this study was not adequately powered to address clinical associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these findings highlight that ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and ADAMTS13 dysfunction can occur in APS, and although the clinical significance remains undetermined, ADAMTS13 dysfunction may be contributory to thrombogenesis in autoimmune conditions other than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
