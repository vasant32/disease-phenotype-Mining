<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the placental bed in APS pregnancies for evidence of impaired trophoblast invasion, endothelial cell activation (ECA) and macrophage infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biopsies from the presumed site of the placental bed were obtained from 12 women with treated primary APS and 16 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical methods were employed to investigate expression of cytokeratin (trophoblasts), alpha-actin (smooth muscle), CD68 (macrophages) and VCAM-1 (as marker of ECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinoid and elastin distribution and expression were determined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>/Schiff and orcein stain, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three APS pregnancies developed IUGR, one with concurrent pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 12 APS biopsies were confirmed to be from the placental bed; one patient failed to meet APS criteria and was excluded from analysis; six included spiral arteries in the biopsy; 11 of 16 controls' biopsies were from the placental bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APS biopsies had a higher concentration of inflammatory cells (p=0.0001), particularly macrophages (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three APS biopsies showed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with hyperplastic vessels; one demonstrated arterial thromboses, but none had profound vasculopathy/atherosis or ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inflammatory mechanisms in the placental bed may contribute to APS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
