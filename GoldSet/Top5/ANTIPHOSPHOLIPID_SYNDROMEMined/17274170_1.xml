<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed SLE patients attending a specialist <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> clinic both to assess the occurrence of APLAs and its clinical presentations and to audit the effectiveness of screening for APL antibodies in a specialist clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>204 patients attended the newly established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> outpatient clinic over a twenty-seven month period; 42 (34 female, 8 male) with a diagnosis of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (24%), eight female and 2 male with a median age of 38.5 years (range 20 to 64 years) fulfilled the ACR criteria for secondary APLAs (Table 2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall 37 patients (88%) with SLE were screened for APLAs during the study period: 94% of females and 62.5% of males were screened (for anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or both), 27% had evidence of APLAs, 24% had positive antibodies but were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a significant occurrence of APLAs among SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the important clinical implications of this disorder including substantial risk of fetal loss and patient morbidity or mortality, routine screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE patients for APL antibodies is recommended </plain></SENT>
