<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have established that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are crucial downstream molecules of anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI-induced TLR4 signaling pathway in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells and explored the potential mechanisms of their self-regulation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI complex firstly induced expression of IRAK4 and IRAK1, then IRAK1 phosphorylation and last IRAK3 upregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI complex simultaneously and acutely enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of TRAF6, TRAF4 and zinc finger protein A20 (A20), while chronically increased A20 protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI complex-induced IRAKs and TRAFs expression and activation were attenuated by knockdown of ANX2 by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with ANX2-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference lentiviruses (LV-RNAi-ANX2) or by treatment with paclitaxel, which inhibits TLR4 as an <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both IRAK1/4 inhibitor and a specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitor</z:chebi> MG-132 could attenuate TRAFs expression as well as TF expression induced by anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI complex </plain></SENT>
