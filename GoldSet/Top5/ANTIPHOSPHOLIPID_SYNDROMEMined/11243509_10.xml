<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six patients (71 females), who fulfilled 1982 ACR criteria for SLE, were prospectively studied for the clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS), and their sera were analysed for the presence of IgG/IgM/IgA anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL) by an in-house ELISA and, in 65 of them, for the presence of IgG anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2 GPI) by a commercial kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (51%) patients were positive for aCL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were positive for IgG aCL, either alone (79.6%) or along with IgM and/or IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (69.3%) out of 39 aCL-positive and seven (26.9%) out of 26 aCL-negative sera were positive for IgG antibodies to beta2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation (r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.05) between the levels of aCL and anti-beta2 GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients had features of definite or suggestive APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, recurrent pregnancy loss and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> manifestations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> eight, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> one) were seen in 20, 13 and nine patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the peripheral vessels was seen in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was significantly associated with the presence of aCL and anti-beta2 GPI antibodies (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The characteristic association of definite APS (recurrent pregnancy loss and arterial/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) was lacking </plain></SENT>
