<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cessation of anticoagulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) can have devastating consequences with progression to CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Making a diagnosis of APS can however be challenging because of the evolving diagnostic criteria and difficulty in confirming thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of these patients can also be complex, especially in those with coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New potential treatments are emerging targeted on the immunomodulation of APS rather than just prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article aims to highlight these diagnostic and management difficulties by reporting and discussing three cases of APS with progression to CAPS following cessation of anticoagulation, one with fatal consequences, with confirmation of CAPS on autopsy, and two with successful treatment and outcomes </plain></SENT>
