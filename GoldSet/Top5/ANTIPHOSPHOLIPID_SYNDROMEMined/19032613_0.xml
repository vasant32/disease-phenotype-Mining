<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: While relying on previous publications, our aim was to examine the morphologic changes, induced in early rat embryos by intra-uterine exposure to the low-molecular weight fraction of boiled human serum containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) that had been obtained from women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Human APLA-positive sera were pooled, boiled, centrifuged and separated by ultrafiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight fraction lower than 30 kDa was used for the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty microlitres was injected into one uterine horn of 12 pregnant rats, 5 or 6 days after fertilization, while similarly prepared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum or saline were injected into the contralateral horn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rats were subsequently sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial sections, obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> uterine horns, were stained histologically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> embryos developed in the control uterine horns, while embryos in the experimental horns were destroyed rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> appeared 2 hr following the injection, and 4 hr later <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the embryonic cells were apoptotically destroyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was only partial damage to cytotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the existence of a novel factor in the APLA-positive serum, causing a detrimental effect to the conceptus, without any relation to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
