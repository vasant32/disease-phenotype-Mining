<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its major association is with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is characterized further by in vitro prolongation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent coagulation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in vivo it is associated with a markedly increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, both arterial and venous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 36-yr-old female patient with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody syndrome who presented initially for diagnostic laparoscopy and later for exploratory laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her postoperative course after the first <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anaesthetic</z:chebi> was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the second operation, she deteriorated further with worsening cardiac, renal and respiratory function and eventually died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody syndrome in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further aspects of this puzzling condition and its <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> implications are discussed </plain></SENT>
