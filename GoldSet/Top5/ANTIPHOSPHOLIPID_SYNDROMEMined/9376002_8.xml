<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine pregnancies of 28 patients were studied: 23 placentas delivered from 23 women with APL (13 with APL syndrome and 10 with serological APL); 8 untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> before APL diagnosis from 6 of the 13 patients with APL syndrome and 1 of 10 with serological APL; and 8 miscarriages by 5 additional women before APL syndrome diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathology was reviewed by a pathologist blinded except to gestational age </plain></SENT>
