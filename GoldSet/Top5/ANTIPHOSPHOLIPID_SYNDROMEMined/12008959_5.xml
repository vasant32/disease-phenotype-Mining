<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This investigation was undertaken to test whether anti-LBPA antibodies and IgG from patients with APS interfere with intracellular beta2GPI distribution in EAhy926 endothelial cells and with the coagulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell incubation with anti-LBPA MoAb or with patients' IgG resulted in antibody binding to late endosomes and caused beta2GPI redistribution and accumulation within perinuclear vesicular structures reminiscent of late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that aPI may contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of APS by modifying the intracellular traffic of proteins, by interactions between aPl and LBPA, beta2GPI and/or LBPA-beta2GPI complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of anti-LBPA MoAb was analyzed in a sensitized activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) system and in a dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant, concentration-dependent effect of the antibody on both aPTT and dRVVT prolongation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that LBPA is an important <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> target for aPl with potential functional implications for the immunopathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
