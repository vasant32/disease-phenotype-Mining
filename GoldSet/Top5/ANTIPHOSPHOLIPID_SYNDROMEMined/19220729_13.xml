<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OBJECTIVES: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), the immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> for the majority of circulating pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) is the N-terminal domain I (DI) of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that recombinant DI inhibits the binding of aPLs in fluid phase to immobilized native antigen, and that this inhibition is greater with the DI(D8S/D9G) mutant and absent with the DI(R39S) mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we hypothesized that DI and DI(D8S/D9G) would inhibit aPL-induced pathogenicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice (n = 5, each group) were injected with purified IgG derived from APS patients (IgG-APS, 500 microg) or IgG from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy serum (IgG-NHS) and either recombinant DI, DI(R39S), DI(D8S/D9G), or an irrelevant control <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (at 10-40 microg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables measured were femoral vein <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dynamics in treated and control groups following standardized vessel injury, expression of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the aortic endothelial surface, and tissue factor (TF) activity in murine macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG-APS significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size as compared with IgG-NHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IgG-APS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> enhancement effect was abolished in mice pretreated with recombinant DI (P &lt;or= 0.0001) and DI(D8S/D9G) (P &lt;or= 0.0001), but not in those treated with DI(R39S) or control <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect by DI was dose-dependent, and at lower doses DI(D8S/D9G) was a more potent inhibitor of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DI (P &lt;or= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DI also inhibited IgG-APS induction of VCAM-1 on the aortic endothelial surface and TF production by murine macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings in this proof-of-concept study support the development of recombinant DI or the novel variant DI(D8S/D9G) as a potential future therapeutic agent for APS </plain></SENT>
