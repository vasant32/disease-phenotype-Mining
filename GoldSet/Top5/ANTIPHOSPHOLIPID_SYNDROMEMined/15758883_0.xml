<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a patient with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He suffered from repetitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> level was found to be 217 s (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &lt;50 s), he was diagnosed as the primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He received steroid pulsation therapy with 1000 mg of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) and 50 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> to attenuate the antibody activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four months after the last PTCA, he experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and approximately 90% of stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) lesion was apparent, although the titer for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was reduced to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9589">ticlopidine hydrochloride</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, his disease was found to be resistant to these medical treatments, and surgical treatment was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since cardiopulmonary bypass is known to exaggerate its coagulatory and fibrinolytic complications, off-pump CABG (OPCAB) was feasible in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The left internal thoracic artery (ITA) was anastomosed to the LAD using the off-pump technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure was successful, and the postoperative course for 3 years has been satisfactory without any cardiovascular complaints </plain></SENT>
