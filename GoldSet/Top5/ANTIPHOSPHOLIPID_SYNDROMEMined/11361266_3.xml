<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the association and possible etiological role of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in young Indian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty six patients &lt; 40 years of age including 22 with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (excluding those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and SLE), 24 with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI and 21 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients and the controls were tested for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and kaolin clotting time (KCT) and anti-caridiolipin antibodies (aCL) of IgM and IgG types using an ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The screening tests for LA with APTT and KCT were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroup 18.18% patients (4/22) and in MI subgroup 4.16% (1/24) patients had raised aCL titers with statistically significant association only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subgroup (p=0.0201) and not for MI subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher proportion of aCL positive cases were found in patients without any risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (4/12), compared to patients with one or more risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (1/34), p=0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Younger patients without identifiable risk factors for atheroscerosis presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, are more likely to have an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) as the etiology, and should be screened for it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No such association however was observed for MI patients </plain></SENT>
