<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 40 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> (at least 3 occurrences) and repeatedly positive test results for anticardiolipin or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with IVIG or LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both therapies were started when the women were pregnant as documented by a positive urine test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IVIG was stopped at the thirty-first week of gestation, aspirin at the thirty-fourth week, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at the thirty-seventh week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of interest was the rate of live births with the 2 treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at the time of randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The women treated with LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin had a higher rate of live births (84%) than those treated with IVIG (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin should be considered as the standard therapy for recurrent pregnancy loss due to aPL </plain></SENT>
