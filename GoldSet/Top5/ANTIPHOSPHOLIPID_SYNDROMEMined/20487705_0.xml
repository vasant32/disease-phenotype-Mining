<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) in serum of MS patients has been reported to be as low as 10%, or sometimes as high as 88% of the cases, although its significance in the pathogenesis of the disease, or its diagnostic usefulness is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to describe the clinic and demographic characteristics of a sample of patients with MS from the Hospital General de México (HGM), as well as to determine the presence and frequency of APLA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study with patients from the Neurology Department at the HGM was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were diagnosed with MS over a one-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic characteristics were compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VDRL and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-beta2GP-1 complex antibodies were analyzed in CSF and serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in the study, the majority females (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predominant clinic feature was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (66.6%) followed by medullary involvement (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of patients were ambulatory (&lt; 4 EDSS points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Auto-antibody levels were found in negative ranges in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, both in CSF and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical-demographic characteristics in patients studied in this work were similar to those previously reported, and the levels of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-beta2GP-1 were negative, thus indicating the existence of different clinical and demographic variables influencing their detection </plain></SENT>
