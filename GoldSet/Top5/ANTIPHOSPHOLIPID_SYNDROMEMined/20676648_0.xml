<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty-three SLE patients with NP involvement observed from 1999 to 2008 and 247 SLE patients without NP manifestations, matched for sex, age and disease duration were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A neuropsychiatric (NP) event represented the heralding symptom of the disease in 40.5% of NPSLE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NPSLE patients had a major cumulative number of the investigated factors than controls without NP involvement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APS and systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were more frequently detected among patients with focal NP manifestations, especially cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, overall, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> should be regarded as a potential independent "risk factor" for focal involvement, especially for cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
