<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LA antibodies recognize the complex of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-bound (human) prothrombin, in this way inhibiting the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent coagulation reactions, whereas aCL antibodies are directed towards beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI) bound to an anionic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to their behavior in coagulation reactions, we have divided aCL antibodies into two groups: aCL-type A, which inhibit the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent coagulation reactions because they enhance the binding of beta 2-GPI to the procoagulant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface; and aCL-type B antibodies, which are devoid of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the distinctive laboratory and clinical profiles of 25 patients with well-characterized, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent inhibitor of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had LA antibodies (aCL-type B were concomitantly present in 10 cases, while in the other four, aCL titer was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), and the other 11 had aCL-type A antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The laboratory evaluation of the two groups showed the dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) to be the most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e> test in the aCL-type A-positive group, whereas the kaolin clotting time (KCT) was the most abnormal assay in the LA-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, the ratios of the coagulation times of patient plasma over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pooled plasma (mean +/- standard deviation) for LA versus aCL-type A antibodies were 1.48 +/- 0.27 versus 2.20 +/- 0.42, P = .0001, and 2.22 +/- 0.42 versus 1.50 +/- 0.42, P = .0003, for the dRVVT and KCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed either in the ratios of the activated partial thromboplastin times and the prothrombin times or the plasma levels of beta 2-GPI and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, aCL titers were significantly higher in aCL-type A-positive patients (147 +/- 44 U) than in the LA-positive group (61 +/- 55 U; P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We ruled out the possibility that platelet contamination of plasma could account for the observed coagulation profiles, as the two patterns were reproduced in platelet-free plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we performed clotting tests in plasma in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and calcium after addition of factor IXa or factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The assay performed with factor Xa was more sensitive to the presence of aCL-type A antibodies, while the assay performed with factor IXa was preferentially sensitive to LA-containing plasmas, supporting the earlier findings with the dRVVT and KCT assays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
