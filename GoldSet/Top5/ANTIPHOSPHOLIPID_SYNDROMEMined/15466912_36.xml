<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor (TF), the major initiator of the coagulation system, is induced on monocytes by aPL in vitro, explaining, in part, the pathophysiology in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the nature of the aPL-induced signal transduction pathways leading to TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated aPL-inducible genes in PBMC using cDNA array system and real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was related to TF expression when PBMCs were treated, in the presence of beta(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), with human monoclonal anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies [beta(2)GPI-dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL/beta(2)GPI)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting studies using monocyte cell line (RAW264.7) demonstrated that p38 MAPK protein was phosphorylated with nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation by monoclonal aCL/beta(2)GPI treatment, and that SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, decreased the aCL/beta(2)GPI-induced TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The p38 MAPK phosphorylation, NF-kappaB translocation and TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression triggered by aCL/beta(2)GPI were abolished in the absence of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in aPL-induced TF expression on monocytes and suggest that the p38 MAPK may be a possible therapeutic target to modify a pro-thrombotic state in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
