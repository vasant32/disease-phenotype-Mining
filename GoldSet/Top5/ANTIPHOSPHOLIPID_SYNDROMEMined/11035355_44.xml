<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This pilot investigation was undertaken to assess the efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy for the treatment of women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> is the only sequela </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the setting of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> clinic of a tertiary referral obstetric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants were 50 women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> (&gt;/=3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women were recruited after full investigative screening at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with &gt;/=3 fetal losses and persistently positive results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were randomly allocated to receive either aspirin (75 mg daily) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigators, clinicians, and patients were blinded to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of live births, antenatal complications, and delivery and neonatal outcomes were recorded prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were compared by chi(2) analysis with Yates' correction, the Fisher exact test, or the Student t test as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 10 exclusions after random assignment because of inappropriate inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of the placebo (17/20) group and 80% of the aspirin-treated group (16/20) were delivered of live infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in antenatal complications or neonatal morbidity between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that low-dose aspirin has no additional benefit when added to supportive care for women for whom recurrent early fetal loss is the only sequela of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This live birth rate with supportive care alone exceeds the published live birth rates for women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-mediated recurrent fetal loss who were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This trial, like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other trials in this field, is small, but its results bring into question the need for pharmacologic intervention for women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> for whom recurrent fetal loss is the only sequela </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight the need for a large randomized controlled trial to identify the optimal treatment for this group of women and justify the inclusion of a placebo arm in any such trial </plain></SENT>
