<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The sera patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were tested, by ELISA, for antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (aPE), as well as to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and compared to healthy blood donors (HBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both, SLE and APS patients presented a higher titre of IgM-aPE antibodies than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, while the IgG and IgA aPE reactivity did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APS patients were characterized by higher IgM-aPE antibody titres than SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the predominant isotype of aCL antibodies in APS patients was IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IgM aPE reactivity was correlated with IgM aCL reactivity, while no correlation was observed between the total IgM values and IgM-aPE binding units of sera tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since it was shown that beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta 2-GPI) contributes to a complex antigen by binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and that this antigen is recognized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> from autoimmune patients, sera beta 2-GPI levels were measured and correlated to aCL and APE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although APS patients had higher beta 2-GPI levels than SLE patients, no correlation was found between the beta 2-GPI levels and IgG/IgM aCL and IgM-aPE reactivities a finding suggesting that in addition to beta 2-GPI, other cofactors for aPE antibodies may exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that aPE and aCL antibodies co-exist and that the IgM-isotype is predominant in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IgA and IgG aPE antibodies appear to occur in low titres in these patients, as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and may exist as natural autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the high IgM-aPE antibodies may be viewed as a thymus independent process </plain></SENT>
