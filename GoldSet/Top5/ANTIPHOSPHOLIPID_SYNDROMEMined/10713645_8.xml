<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Testing for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) using anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) has been problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Titers may fluctuate or even become negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I assays (abeta2-GPI) may be more reliable for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, blinded study over a nine-month period we retested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients seen for routine follow-up visits in our clinic who had previously been evaluated for aCL-associated illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into two groups: group A-patients previously positive for aCL; group B-patients previously negative for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were further classified according to disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were retested for both aCL and abeta2-GPI (isotypes G, M, A for each) using uniform testing standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 118 patients with previously positive aCL (group A) were retested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat aCL were positive in 52/118 (44%), abeta2-GPI positive in 69/118 (58%) and 82/118 (69.5%) were positive for one or both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with serious organ damage (92% with documented APS), 48.6% were aCL positive, 64% positive for abeta2-GPI, and 75.7% were positive for one or both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When only one assay was positive, abeta2-GPI was most frequent (P=0.0096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, IgA abeta2-GPI was the most frequent isotype found (60.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On retesting of 73 aCL-negative patients (group B), 9/73 (12%) were aCL positive, 27/73 (36%) were abeta2-GPI positive, with 24/73 (32.9%) having isolated abeta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of those positive for abeta2-GPI, IgA abeta2-GPI was present in 74 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Many of these patients had documented APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our data, abeta2-GPI assays are superior to aCL assays for diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The combined use of both assays enhance positive testing results in up to 75% of patients with APS at any stage of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>ACL negative patients suspected of having APS should be retested for both abeta2-GPI and aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>IgA abeta2-GPI appears to be the most important isotype detected </plain></SENT>
