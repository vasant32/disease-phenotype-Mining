<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) are at increased risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, but the possibility of predicting this risk seems rather limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarities were recently found between aPL and CRP in the pathology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated the predictive role of hs-CRP in a cohort of patients with neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up investigation was done in a cohort of 55 aPL-positive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>hs-CRP levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at enrollment and were compared to the patients' condition after a median period of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were detected according to the Standardization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">Anticoagulants</z:chebi> (SSC) of the ISTH </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hs-CRP was measured by latex-enhanced turbidometry (dimension RXL, Dade Behring) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with aPL, elevated levels of hs-CRP were closely associated with an increased rate of recurrent or residual symptoms (OR, 12.5; 95% CI, 3.72-41.94) and were not related to other risk factors, except smoking (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate at which a given patient's condition deteriorated was also related to the level of hs-CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), elevated levels of hs-CRP may identify a group of patients which is at high risk of recurrent or residual neurological symptoms and which may benefit from more careful follow-up and from antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
