<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This observation prompted us to prove if anti-beta 2GPI exist in human sera by using a reliable method and then to investigate if these are independent from aCl antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new ELISA for the detection of anti-beta 2GPI antibodies employing the coating of the protein in <z:chebi fb="124" ids="41609">carbonate</z:chebi> buffer to irradiated microtitre plates and the filtration of serum samples, that makes irrelevant the binding to the uncoated wells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG F(ab)2 fragments from IgG positive sera were shown bind beta 2GPI, providing that the binding was a specific antibody binding, mediated by the antigen binding site of the antibody molecule: moreover the antibodies were not able to differentiate native and delipidated beta 2GPI coated plates, making a possible role of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> contaminant unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> content of native as well as delipitated beta 2GPI was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG, but not IgM, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies were classically inhibited by the addition of soluble beta 2GPI, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> liposomes appear to modify the reaction in a completely different way, possibly by the described interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and beta 2GPI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
