<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the name, the Igs associated with APS are predominantly directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins, such as beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (beta 2GP1) and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the cellular immune response to beta 2GP1 in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a serum-free stimulation assay, PBMCs from 8 of 18 patients with APS proliferated to purified beta 2GP1 or to the beta 2GP1 present in serum, whereas no stimulation was observed by PBMCs from healthy individuals, patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, or anticardiolipin Ab-positive patients without histories of thromboses or fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immune response was Ag-specific, requiring class II molecules, CD4+ T cells, and APCs, and was associated with a selective expansion of CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferating T cells produced IFN-gamma but not IL-4, indicating a bias toward a type 1 immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> low grade stimulation of autoreactive beta 2GP1-specific, IFN-gamma-producing Th1 CD4+ T cells may contribute to the high risk of thromboses and pregnancy failure in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
