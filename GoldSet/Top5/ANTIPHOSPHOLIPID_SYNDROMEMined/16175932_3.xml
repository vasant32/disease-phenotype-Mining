<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed 68 patients, 30 males and 38 females diagnosed and followed between 1990 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and during follow-up were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 31.4 +/- 11 years in males and 35.7 +/- 11 years in females (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up after diagnosis was 8.7 +/- 3.1 years in males and 9.2 +/- 2.9 years in females (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find significant differences between the two groups with respect to venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in female patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was more prevalent than in male patients (12/38 versus 3/30, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found a significant prevalence of severe gastrointestinal complications in male compared to female patients (7/30 versus 1/38, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One male patient died due to catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that clinical course in patients with PAPS may be different with significant prevalence of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in females and gastrointestinal involvement in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, hormones, related to gender could be the explanation of these findings </plain></SENT>
