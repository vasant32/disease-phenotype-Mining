<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anecdotal evidence suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) may be a relevant and treatable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> in patients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three groups of patients were evaluated: (1) 77 patients with positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) (60 secondary APS, 11 primary APS, and 6 with aPL only) and uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who were receiving two or more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi>; (2) 91 patients (&lt;/=50 years) attending <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> clinics;(3) 92 normotensive healthy, potential renal transplant donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance renal angiography was used to image the renal arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group 1: 20/77 (26%) patients had evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (16 unilateral and 4 bilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (80%) had smooth well defined stenoses in the proximal third of the renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three further patients had irregular arteries without distinct stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 2: 7/91 (8%) hypertensive patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (chi(2)=10.3, p&lt;0.001 v group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 3: 3/92 (3%) healthy donors had <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (chi(2)=18.2, p&lt;0.0001 v group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significantly increased prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (26%) was found in patients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, compared with relatively young (&lt;/=50 years) hypertensive controls and healthy potential donors </plain></SENT>
