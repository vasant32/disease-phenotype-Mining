<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recurrent fetal loss can be a consequence of placental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, frequently occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, annexin V, is abundant in placental tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of annexin V in maintaining fetal viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Sites of annexin V activity in placenta were found and neutralized, and the physiologic consequences on fetal development were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To find extracellular binding sites for annexin V on placental membrane, 2 approaches were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged recombinant annexin V was infused into pregnant BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endogenous annexin V was evaluated by immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To define a role for annexin V during pregnancy, annexin V was neutralized by tail-vein infusion of affinity-purified anti-annexin V antibodies immediately before mating, 16 hours before the vaginal plugs were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fetal viability, number, and size were evaluated at days 11 or 15 after conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endogenous annexin V is enriched along the apical surfaces of trophoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Animals infused with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged annexin V had confirmed presence of extracellular binding sites for annexin V exclusively along these surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In mice infused with anti-annexin V antibodies, various degrees of fetal absorption were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were present in the fetal component of placentas from partially absorbed embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were present in the decidua of placentas from embryos that were significantly smaller than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryos in the same uterus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Apical surfaces of syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta possess annexin V binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The binding of annexin V to these coagulation-promoting surfaces is crucial for the maintenance of blood flow through the placenta and consequently for fetal viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Infusion of anti-annexin V antibodies decreased the availability of annexin V to bind to the trophoblast surfaces and caused placental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that anti-annexin V autoantibodies may contribute to recurrent pregnancy failure resulting from placental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, as found in patients with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
