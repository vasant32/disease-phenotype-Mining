<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-β(2)GPI Abs are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of Igs targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abs specific to β(2)GPI domain I are strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and obstetric complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to understand the possible pathogenic mechanism for this subset of anti-β(2)GPI Abs, investigating their potential cross-reactivity with other self-proteins involved in inflammatory or coagulant events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the amino acid sequence of the β(2)GPI domain I with human proteins in a protein databank and identified a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sharing 88% identity with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of human TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (41%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (50%) presented serum IgG specific to this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-β(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Abs binding the TLR4 were able to induce NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells that were stably transfected with the TLR4 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-β(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Abs induced activation of TLR4 and triggered interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase phosphorylation and NF-κB translocation, promoting VCAM expression on endothelial cells and TNF-α release by monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our observations suggest a novel pathogenic mechanism in the TLR4 stimulation by anti-β(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Abs that links adaptive immune responses with innate immunity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
