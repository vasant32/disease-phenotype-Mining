<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the IgM <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) present in patients with the recently described <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) also react with PTC and could thus be natural autoantibodies akin to those found in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAPS (n = 20) were found to have increased total B cells, as well as CD5 + B cells, in their peripheral blood, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total lymphocytes, as well as CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6 PAPS patients with increased CD5+ B cells were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003496'>increased levels of IgM</z:hpo> aPL, including aPTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In them we also found a correlation between the number of CD5+ B cells and the levels of IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that within the family of aPLs present in patients with PAPS there may be some that could be IgM natural autoantibodies secreted by CD5+ B cells </plain></SENT>
