<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from 124 blood donors, 60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and 57 SLE patients were measured for anticardiolipin antibodies by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significantly raised IgG (aCLG) and IgM (aCLM) anticardiolipin antibody levels were found in RA and SLE (p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in SLE both aCLG and aCLM levels were significantly higher than in RA (p less than 0.0025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then conducted a transectional study to evaluate aCL levels and disease activity in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a good positive predictive value (70%) between aCL and overall disease activity, but not for individual systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A strong association between aCL and renal involvement irrespective of activity was also found (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine SLE patients fulfilled both the clinical and serological criteria for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and a further 18 patients fulfilled the serological criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that aCL levels are of value in predicting overall disease activity in SLE and in monitoring those patients who fulfil or partially fulfil the criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
