<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beta2GPI-fed mice did not develop serologic and clinical markers of experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) upon immunization with the autoantigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treated group was characterized by low titers of serum anti-beta2GPI and anticardiolipin Abs in the serum, lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e>, low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta2GPI given orally before priming with beta2GPI resulted in complete prevention of experimental APS development; beta2GPI given at an early stage of the disease reduced clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, administration of beta2GPI 70 days postimmunization had a less significant effect on disease expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tolerized mice exhibited a diminished T lymphocyte proliferation response to beta2GPI in comparison with beta2GPI-immunized mice fed with OVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When nontolerant beta2GPI-primed T lymphocytes were mixed with T lymphocytes derived from tolerized mice, a significant inhibition of proliferation upon exposure to beta2GPI was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of suppression was beta2GPI specific and driven, as well as TGF-beta mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beta2GPI-specific response of T lymphocytes from the beta2GPI-fed mice was reversed by anti-TGF-beta Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tolerance was adoptively transferred by CD8+ T cells from the tolerized mice into naive mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those CD8+ cells were MHC class I restricted, found to secrete TGF-beta, and had no cytolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of beta2GPI suppressed priming of CTLs in the recipient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In sum, beta2GPI-induced oral tolerance has an immunomodulatory effect in experimental APS, demonstrating the importance of beta2GPI in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
