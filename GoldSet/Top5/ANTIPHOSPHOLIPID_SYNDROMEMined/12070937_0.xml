<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>72 patients with SLE had been investigated, 66 females and six males, aged 17 to 70 years, average 37.03 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> was determined using both ELISA assay for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, ASSERACHROM <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> by Diagnostica Stago and clotting tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tissue thromboplastin inhibition test (TTI) and dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have been found in 24 patients (33.44%), 10 of them were with positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> tests, 6 of them were with positive ELISA test, while 8 of them had positive coagulation and immunological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations that could be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were present in 22 patients (30.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common were thrombotic complications in 16 patients (22.25), recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> in 7 patients (9.7%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in 1 patient (1.39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was determined in 15 patients (20.83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that there is a significant correlation between presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and both thrombotic events and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of thrombotic complications is in direct correlation with the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
