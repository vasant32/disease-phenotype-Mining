<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential immunologic mechanism and involvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of heart valve lesions in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining methods were used to evaluate 13 heart valve specimens derived from eight patients with the APS, either primary or secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary antibodies to human immunoglobulins, complement components, serum albumin and a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody to human anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various tissue specimens from a patient with the APS as well as deformed and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves from subjects without the APS were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linear subendothelial deposition consisting of immunoglobulins with complement components but not of a non-specific serum protein was found in deformed valves from patients with the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the control valves or tissues disclosed similar deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same pattern and location of staining was obtained by the anti-idiotypic antibody to aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant amount of IgG immunoglobulins that bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was eluted from a valve of a patient with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deposits of immunoglobulins including aCL, and of complement components, are common in affected valves of patients with primary and secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such deposits may be involved in the pathogenesis of valvular lesions </plain></SENT>
