<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The preoperative evaluation of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) is important to avoid complications, because VTE is often induced by orthopedic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on radioisotope venography (RIV) using 99mTc-macroaggregated human serum albumin, examining orthopedic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted 34 examinations in 33 patients who were referred for RIV and lung perfusion scintigraphy for the pre-orthopedic operative evaluation of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two board-certified (one nuclear medicine board-certified) radiologists interpreted the images based on the following: (1) flow defect of the lower extremities; (2) interruption of flow; (3) irregular or asymmetric filling of the deep vein (low flow); (4) presence of collateral vessels; and (5) abnormal RI retention on delayed-phase images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scoring was based on a 5-point scale, and more than 2 points was considered VTE positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal findings were noted in 27 of the 34 examinations performed in the 33 patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in the other 7 examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the RI score, 21 patients were classified into the VTE-positive group and 12 into the VTE-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery was canceled because of advanced age and respiratory dysfunction in 2 of the 21 patients in the VTE-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients who underwent surgery, an IVH filter was placed before surgery in 2 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was initiated on the day of surgery in 12 to prevent postoperative VTE, and only one of the patients receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment developed PTE after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery was canceled due to advanced age and at patient's request in 2 of 12 patients in the VTE-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>/ <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was performed to prevent postoperative VTE in only 3 patients: one with a past medical history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarction</z:e>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and one suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient in the VTE-negative group developed VTE after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The preoperative identification of patients with VTE by RIV might be useful for perioperative management and the evaluation of preventive measures against postoperative VTE </plain></SENT>
