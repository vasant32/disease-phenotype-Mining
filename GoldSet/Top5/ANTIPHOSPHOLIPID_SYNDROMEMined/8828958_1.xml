<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adverse reactions during and after Octagam infusion were carefully recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG and ALT levels were recorded monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to HIV, HBV and HCV were recorded every 3 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions following Octagam infusion were uncommon, generally mild and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were transient </plain></SENT>
