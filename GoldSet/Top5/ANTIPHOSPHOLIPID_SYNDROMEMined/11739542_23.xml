<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LAC are detected as an inhibitory effect on PL-restricted in vitro blood coagulation tests, and are comprised mainly of Ab against beta(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and prothrombin (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, anti-PT Ab (aPT) were found to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by some investigators, although this is not confirmed by others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering that aPT are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in patients and that PT is converted into thrombin, we hypothesize that certain aPT in patients may bind to thrombin, and that some of such anti-thrombin Ab may interfere with thrombin-antithrombin (AT) interaction and thus reduce the AT inactivation of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we searched for anti-thrombin Ab in APS patients and then studied those found for their effects on the AT inactivation of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that most, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, aPT-positive patient plasma samples contained anti-thrombin Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study the functional significance of these Ab, we identified six patient-derived mAb that bound to both PT and thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these mAb, three could reduce the AT inactivation of thrombin, whereas others had minimal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that some aPT in patients react with thrombin, and that some of such anti-thrombin Ab could inhibit feedback regulation of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the latter anti-thrombin Ab are likely to promote clotting, it will be important to develop specific assays for such Ab and study their roles in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS patients </plain></SENT>
