<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammatory responses</z:mp> have been linked to gene polymorphisms of several cytokines and Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined IL1 beta, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, IL6, IFN gamma, IL10, tlr4 gene polymorphisms in a family with several members positive for IgG anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2GPI) antibodies but with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in one member only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, anti-beta 2GPI IgG/IgM antibodies, IL1beta, TNFalpha, TGF beta1, IL6, IL10, IFN gamma, tlr4 gene polymorphisms (by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction) in addition to standard thrombophilic risk factors and cytokine serum levels (IL-1 beta, TNFalpha, IL-10) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrent thrombotic events was reported only in the proband, but not in three healthy siblings persistently positive for IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> tlr4 gene and cytokine polymorphisms associated with a high pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> (IL-1 beta promoter-511C/T; TNFalpha G/A; TGFbeta+10T/C, +25C/G; IL-6 -174C/G) were found only in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum cytokine levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case report confirms that protective tlr4 gene polymorphisms are more frequent in asymptomatic aPL carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In line with the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> as second hits for aPL-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the polymorphisms of cytokines linked to higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> were found in the proband only </plain></SENT>
