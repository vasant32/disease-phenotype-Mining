<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include those reactive with antigens on platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, and with vascular endothelial cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the pathogenesis of the thrombotic manifestations of APS remains unexplained, further characterization of these antibodies may be informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have confirmed anti-endothelial cell binding to a range of cell membrane antigens in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, differences in both the pattern of antibody binding and band intensity between human umbilical vein (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 17 primary APS sera, antibody binding to HUVEC cell membranes was found in nine and to HMEC-1 membranes in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding at 72-79 kD was confined to HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 32 SLE sera, binding to HUVEC and HMEC-1 membranes was detected in 17 and 22 respectively, binding at 135-155 kD being confined to HMEC-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the phenotypic variation in endothelial cells of different origins and confirm the frequent presence of autoantibodies reactive with vascular endothelium in both SLE and PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether these antibodies could be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, through induction of endothelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or damage, remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
