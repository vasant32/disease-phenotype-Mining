<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Factor XI (FXI), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-linked covalent homodimer, circulates in plasma, and upon activation initiates the intrinsic/consolidation phase of coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds in FXI are reduced to free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> by oxidoreductases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15033">thioredoxin</z:chebi>-1 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>-1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi> isomerase (PDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified that Cys362-Cys482 and Cys118-Cys147 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds are reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">TRX</z:chebi>-1-treated FXI by thrombin, FXIIa or FXIa was significantly increased compared to non-reduced FXI, indicating that the reduced factor is more efficiently activated than the oxidized protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a novel ELISA system, we compared the amount of reduced FXI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> patients with levels in healthy controls, and found that APS patients have higher levels of reduced FXI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may have implication for understanding the contribution of FXI to APS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with elevated plasma levels of reduced FXI </plain></SENT>
