<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential value of plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigenic activity (vWF:Ag) and other commonly measured clinical variables for predicting which patients with precapillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> would be unlikely to survive 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data obtained at the beginning of the study were analyzed at the end of the first year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients aged 1.2 to 45 years (median, 24 years) entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, and in the remaining ones, pulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular disease</z:e> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">schistosomiasis</z:e> (n = 3), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> (Eisenmenger's syndrome) (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma vWF:Ag was determined by electroimmunodiffusion, and the results were expressed as the percentage of activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 11 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> but only 4 of 29 patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> died during the follow-up period (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial vWF:Ag values were significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group in comparison with the survivors (256.6+/-85.3% and 132.0+/-59.3% activity, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of fatal outcome as a function of plasma vWF:Ag levels was estimated for primary and secondary pulmonary hypertensive patients using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased life expectancy was significantly related to high vWF:Ag levels and an established diagnosis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A plasma vWF:Ag of &gt;240% (p = 0.003) was 54% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying patients who were unlikely to survive 1 year, with an overall predictive value of 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other variables correlated significantly with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma vWF:Ag seems to be a useful biochemical index for predicting short-term prognosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast to hemodynamic and histopathological predictors of survival, vWF:Ag does not require invasive techniques to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In light of the possibility of false-negative results, serial measurements should be performed over time in patients with vWF:Ag of &lt;240% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This observation proved helpful in two patients in this study </plain></SENT>
