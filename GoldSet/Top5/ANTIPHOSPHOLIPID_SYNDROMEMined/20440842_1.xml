<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To possibly block anti-beta2GpI Abs activity, we synthesized the entire DmI comprising residues 1-64 of beta2GpI by chemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oxidative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> renaturation of DmI was achieved in the presence of reduced and oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The folded DmI (N-DmI) was purified by RP-HPLC, and its chemical identity and correct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> pairing (Cys4-Cys47 and Cys32-Cys60) were established by enzymatic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprint analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the conformational characterization, conducted by far- and near-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, provided strong evidence for the native-like structure of DmI, which is also quite resistant to both Gdn-HCl and thermal denaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the thermodynamic stability of N-DmI at 37 degrees C was remarkably low, in agreement with the unfolding energetics of small proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, aAbs failed to bind to plates coated with N-DmI in direct binding experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From ELISA competition experiments with plate-immobilized beta2GpI, a mean IC(50) value of 8.8 microM could be estimated for N-DmI, similar to that of the full-length protein, IC(50)(beta2GpI) = 6.4 microM, whereas the cysteine-reduced and carboxamidomethylated DmI, RC-DmI, failed to bind to anti-beta2GpI Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The versatility of chemical synthesis was also exploited to produce an N-terminally <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-(<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>)(2)-derivative of N-DmI (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi>-N-DmI) to be possibly used as a new tool in APS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi>-N-DmI loaded onto a streptavidin-coated plate selectively recognized aAbs from APS patients </plain></SENT>
