<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes in patients with LAC with no other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> are exceptional, especially during pregnancy, intra- and postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Here we present two cases of patients with classification criteria of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, a history of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancies</z:e> and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during abortion and postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied anticardiolipin (IgG/IgM), beta2glicoprotein-1 (IgG) and antimitochondrial (type 5) antibodies, LAC, rapid plasma reagin, coagulation test, clotting factors and, placental vascular flow from the second trimester of their last pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LAC was repeatedly detected in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin time and clotting factors including factors II and XIII were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>Intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> was also observed in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> was detected in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We tried enoxaparin (60-80 mg/day) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/day) therapy and no maternal, hemorrhagic or thrombotic episodes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Exceptionally, LAC may be associated with recurrent, life-threatening <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, even in patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020640" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prothrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The close follow-up and early <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and steroid therapy seems to be able to control thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications during the pregnancy and postpartum </plain></SENT>
