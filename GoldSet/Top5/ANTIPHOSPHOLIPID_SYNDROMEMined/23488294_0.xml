<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> received enoxaparin or enoxaparin and aspirin before enrollment into the study Patients from the control group did not receive any antithrombotic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean Pulsatility Index (PI) of both uterine arteries and the presence or the absence of the "notch" was assessed, both at 12 and 20 weeks gestation in each patient from the study and from the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean PI values in the uterine arteries at 12 weeks in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and in controls were 1.82 (1.00-3.13) and 1.52 (1.30-1.88), respectively (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean PI value in the uterine arteries was 7.27 (0.61-2.48) in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> at 20 weeks, which turned out to be significantly higher (p = 0.026) than in the control group 1.07 (0.8-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bilateral "notch" was found at 12 weeks gestation in 40% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> vs. 0% in the control group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the groups in this parameter at 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increased impedance of flow was found in the uterine arteries in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> at 12 and 20 weeks gestation in spite of antithrombotic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
