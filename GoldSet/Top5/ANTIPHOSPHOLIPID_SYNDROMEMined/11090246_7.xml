<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we followed the fate of PS-exposing platelets in the presence of antibodies purified from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and primary Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Syndrome (APS) patients' sera by beta2GPI affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombin-activated platelets exposed PS and associated to beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both events were required for recognition by antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human monocyte-derived macrophages phagocytosed activated platelets only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each macrophage internalized an average of 3.16+/-0.2 platelets after 60 min at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis did not increase after longer incubations (4.65+/-0.26 platelets internalized by each macrophage after 300 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition of platelets by anti-beta2GPI antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon withdrawal of thrombin, platelets downregulated PS (PS exposure t(1/2): 242 min) and the ability to be recognized by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Purified beta2GPI bound to PS-exposing platelets (association t(1/2): 250 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">Phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine exposure and beta2GPI association had virtually identical kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding prolonged the exposure of the beta2GPI/PS complex (t(1/2): &gt;1200 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ability to phagocytose opsonized platelets was accordingly sustained (5.3+/-0.2 opsonized platelets were internalized by each macrophage after 60 min and 9.4+/-0.3 after 300 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibodies therefore poise activated platelets in a PS-exposing status, preventing the recycling of their function and favoring their phagocytic clearance </plain></SENT>
