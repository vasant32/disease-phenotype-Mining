<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 113 patients with SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies were examined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These antibodies were detected in 31% of the population, and were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency was significantly higher in patients who did not satisfy the Sapporo criteria, but met the Harris and Hughes diagnostic criteria (36%) than in non-APS patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggest that IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies should be listed in the diagnostic criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
