<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgG and IgM ss and ds DNA antibodies were measured by ELISA in 30 patients who fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared these patients with 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and seven patients with idiopathic SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the sera for anti-nuclear antibodies by Hep-2 cells and for dsDNA antibodies by Crithidia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 16 patients with PAPS had antibodies to ss and/or dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three of the 16 positive patients had both IgG and IgM anti-DNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had anti-nuclear antibodies, but only two were weakly positive for dsDNA antibodies by Crithidia immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of 30 patients with PAPS had IgM anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to two out of the seven SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PAPS patients with anti-DNA antibodies were clinically indistinguishable from the PAPS patients without antibodies against DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that 53% of patients with PAPS had antibodies to DNA which supports the view that PAPS and SLE are probably overlapping disorders </plain></SENT>
