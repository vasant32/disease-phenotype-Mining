<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate avidity of anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta(2)-GPIs) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic events or pregnancy loss as compared with clinical event-free periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To do so, 69 sera samples from 16 patients (6 with primary APS and 10 with APS secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> ) were selected on the basis of anti-beta(2)-GPI positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Avidity of IgG anti-beta(2)-GPIs was determined by chaotropic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> concentration during antibody binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and low-avidity anti-beta(2)-GPIs were measured in APS patients, with no clear pattern regarding the time of thrombotic events or pregnancy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In general, anti-beta(2)-GPI avidity did not change substantially during disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that avidity of anti-beta(2)-GPIs appears to be a rather stable parameter in an individual APS patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the previously shown association of high-avidity anti-beta(2)-GPIs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, avidity of anti-beta(2)-GPIs may be a better predictor of predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and unsuccessful pregnancy than levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, which may fluctuate over time owing to several factors </plain></SENT>
