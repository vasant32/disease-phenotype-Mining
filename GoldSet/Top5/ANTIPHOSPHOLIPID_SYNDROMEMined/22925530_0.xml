<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that β(2)GPI can adapt to different conformations, a circular, a S-shaped and a J-shaped conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In literature <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> properties of β(2)GPI have been indicated, though there is no consensus on how β(2)GPI exerts a certain action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article will first review existing data on the conformation of β(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we will investigate whether the conformation of β(2)GPI plays a role in in the proposed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of β(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effect of native β(2)GPI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-bound β(2)GPI on thrombin generation (TG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Native β(2)GPI was found to have no significant effect on the TG regardless of the concentration of tissue factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, β(2)GPI preincubated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> significantly inhibited TG triggered with low TF concentration, suggesting an effect on the intrinsic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that native β(2)GPI in circulation obtains its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity in the presence of anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> such as activated blood cells thereby serving as an inhibitory modulator in hemostasis </plain></SENT>
