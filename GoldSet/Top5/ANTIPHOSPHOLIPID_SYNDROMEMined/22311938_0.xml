<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cerebral blood flow abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) patients without ongoing neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 28 PAPS patients and 28 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid Doppler ultrasound, and echocardiographic evaluation were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography measured mean flow velocity (MFV) in the carotid siphon, middle, anterior, posterior, intracranial vertebral arteries, and basilar artery (11 cerebral arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were considered abnormal when the MFV was out of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range according to age and/or flow asymmetry and/or more than four arterial segments affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 41.4 ± 11.2 and 39.3 ± 8.6 years in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease duration was 11 ± 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in MFV in 7/11 cerebral arteries in PAPS patients, mainly in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries was found compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with a greater number of affected arteries was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We did not find an association between MFV and abnormal echocardiography, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and carotid intima-media thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients with PAPS can have significantly increased MFVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These alterations may be the consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, PAPS vasculopathy or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whatever the cause, these findings can represent a risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in PAPS patients that needs the trial of other therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
