<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although patients with the catastrophic form represent less than 1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with APS, they are usually in a life-threatening medical situation that requires high clinical awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we propose guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with catastrophic APS, based on the cumulated published experience of 130 cases with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe that it is essential that this syndrome should be diagnosed early and treated aggressively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of high doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> plus intravenous gamma globulins or plasmapheresis is proposed as the treatment of choice in patients with this severe condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, preventive measures in patients with APS may be effective to avoid the development of catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommend that these proposed guidelines be tested in future prospective, collaborative studies to assess clearly the real prevalence and the best therapy for this life-threatening condition </plain></SENT>
