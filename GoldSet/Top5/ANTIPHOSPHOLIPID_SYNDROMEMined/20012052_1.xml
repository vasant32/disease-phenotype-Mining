<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the characteristics of SLE patients with PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure more than 30 mmHg at rest on echocardiogram were diagnosed with PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was done only in patients with clinical or radiological evidence suggesting PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right heart catheterization was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 10 SLE patients with PH between 1980 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared their clinical and laboratory parameters with those of 97 consecutive SLE patients without PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the ten patients with PH were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 25.2 ± 6.9 years; the mean duration of follow-up was 93.4 ± 52.8 months, and the interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SLE and PH diagnosis was 9.0 ± 4.6 (5-21) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody positivity</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the PH group (80 vs. 36%; p &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant difference between two groups in regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> was higher in PH group (60 vs. 27%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Renal involvement (80 vs. 43%; p &lt; 0.05), neuropsychiatric involvement (40 vs. 7.2%; p &lt; 0.005) and serositis (70 vs. 14.4%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly more frequent in the PH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean damage score in patients with and without PH were 4.0 ± 2.4 and 0.4 ± 1.0, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four patients with PH died during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study reveals that the presence of PH defines a subgroup of patients with a severe disease and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> may contribute to the pathogenesis of PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SLE, especially those positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and/or with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> should be regularly evaluated for the development of PH </plain></SENT>
