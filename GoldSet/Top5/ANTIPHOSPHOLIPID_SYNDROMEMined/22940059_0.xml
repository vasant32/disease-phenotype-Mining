<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells were treated with anti-β(2)GPI/β(2)GPI complex, enhanced TF expression was observed, along with induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the activity of MAPKs was blocked by their corresponding inhibitors (SB203580: p38; U0126: ERK; SP600125: JNK), the expression of TF was reduced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the anti-β(2)GPI/β(2)GPI-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 was inhibited significantly by TAK-242, a blocker of the signaling transduction mediated by the intracellular domain of TLR4; sc-204013, a specific inhibitor of IRAKs, was also able to partially inhibit the phosphorylation of the MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that MAPKs (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) were the crucial downstream targets of the anti-β(2)GPI/β(2)GPI-triggered TLR4 signaling pathways in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This essential role of MAPKs may also promote better understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
