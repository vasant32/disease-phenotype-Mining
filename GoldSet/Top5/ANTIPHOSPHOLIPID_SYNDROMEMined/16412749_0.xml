<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent Miscarriage</z:e> Clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a tertiary care centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Five women with recurrent pregnancy loss were recruited as cases, whereas another five women having natural cycle donor insemination were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Serial measurement of serum beta-hCG, activin A, and inhibin A was performed from postovulatory day 12 until 11 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Comparison of levels of beta-hCG, activin A, and inhibin A at the time of conception onwards till 11 weeks in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): There were no significant differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): There does not appear to be any obvious endocrinological alteration in the conception cycle of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> compared with a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the initiation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> does not produce a significant change in activin A and inhibin A levels </plain></SENT>
