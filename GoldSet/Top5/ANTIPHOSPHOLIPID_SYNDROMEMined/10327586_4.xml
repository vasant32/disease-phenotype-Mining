<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A second crosslinking agent, dimethyl-suberimidate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e>), did not expose the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, which may be a consequence of its having less tendency than GDA to form intermolecular links </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE experiments demonstrate that GDA does promote extensive intermolecular crosslinking of beta 2 GPI, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e> does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">Formaldehyde</z:chebi> also reacts with the lysine residues of beta 2 GPI, but does not expose the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The circular dichroism spectra of native and modified beta 2 GPI confirm that GDA induces changes in conformation that are qualitatively different from those caused by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that binding of lysine residues is not a sufficient condition for exposure of the autoepitope, and also support the likelihood that anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies bind only to aggregates of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, by synthesizing an active holoantigen of beta 2 GPI, conditions were defined that are necessary for binding of human autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
