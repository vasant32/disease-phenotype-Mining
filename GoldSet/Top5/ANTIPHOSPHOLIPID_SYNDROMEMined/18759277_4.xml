<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, using proteomic techniques, we evaluated changes in protein expression of monocytes from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) related to the pathophysiology of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one APS patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups: patients with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls, we studied patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but without aPL, and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proteins that were more significantly altered among monocytes from APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (annexin I, annexin II, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi> isomerase, Nedd8, RhoA proteins, and Hsp60) were functionally related to the induction of a procoagulant state as well as to autoimmune-related responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteins reported to be connected to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (e.g., fibrinogen and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) were also determined to be significantly deregulated in APS patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro treatment with IgG fractions purified from the plasma of APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> changed the pattern of protein expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocytes in the same way that was observed in vivo for monocytes from APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the first time, proteomic analysis has identified novel proteins that may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of APS, thus providing potential new targets for pathogenesis-based therapies for the disease </plain></SENT>
