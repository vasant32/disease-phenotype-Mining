<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) reactive with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) are found in the sera of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, aPL/beta2-GPI complexes are associated with arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, i.e., the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that aPL/beta2-GPI complexes could perturb the platelet membrane and increase production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>, a proaggregatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoid</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We isolated an IgG fraction containing anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) and the plasma cofactor, beta2-GPI, from a patient with a high titer of aCL and thrombotic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then examined the effect of aCL, beta2-GPI, and the aCL/beta2-GPI complex on platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> (a stable metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) biosynthesis in vitro from 7 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured in vitro platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> biosynthesis in 7 patients with APS and in 8 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found: (1) significantly increased in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production by platelets from controls after incubation with aCL/beta2-GPI complexes; (2) moderately increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production by aCL alone; (3) no increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production by beta2-GPI alone; and (4) significantly increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28667">11-dehydro-TXB2</z:chebi>, a metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production in vivo, in the urine of patients with APS compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aCL/beta2-GPI complexes play a role in activating platelets to produce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>, which could contribute to the prothrombotic state found in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
