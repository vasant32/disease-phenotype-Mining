<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of anticardiolipin (aCL) or anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in a cohort of patients with primary (PAPS) and secondary (SAPS) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and other rheumatic and infectious conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera were drawn from 226 patients with PAPS (n= 66), SAPS (n= 60), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) (n= 30), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (SSc) (n= 30) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (n= 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG, IgM, IgA aCL and anti-beta2GPI antibodies were determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We employed Varelisa diagnostic kits (Pharmacia Diagnostics GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In APS patients: aCL and anti-betaGP1 antibodies were detected in 81.8% and 70% in PAPS and SAPS patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In PAPS, aCL were detected in 71.2%, and anti-beta2GP1 in 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SAPS, aCL were detected in 63.3%, and anti-beta2GP1 in 53.3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, aCL and anti-beta2GP1 antibodies were detected in 46.7% of patients in low levels: aCL in 36.7% and anti-beta2GP1 in 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aCL antibodies were detected in 10%, 13.3%, and 0% of RA patients, SSc patients, and healthy persons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GP1 antibodies were not detected in RA patients, SSc patients, and healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: aCL and anti-beta2GP1 antibodies are more frequently found in sera of APS patients, and can be found in low levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GP1 assay found to be more specific than aCL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> determination </plain></SENT>
