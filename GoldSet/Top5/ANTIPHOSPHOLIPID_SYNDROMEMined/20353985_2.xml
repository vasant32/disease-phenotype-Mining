<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL are not diagnostic tests and considering them as such can be misleading and may direct attention away from the more important clinical issue of risk modification and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When considering aPL as risk factors, quantitative aPL tests such enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibodies, should be interpreted carefully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk for clinical manifestations appears to be associated with moderate to high levels of these autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower levels may be statistically abnormal compared with a control population, but may not be associated with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) are generally thought to be more strongly associated with the risk of clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) than aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One reason for the stronger association may be related to patients' antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA assays are not very analytically sensitive, i.e. a relatively high concentration of antibodies is required to prolong the clotting time in these tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the presence of LA indicates a high titer of aPL and this, rather than the intrinsic functional characteristics of LA antibodies, may explain the high risk of clinical manifestations associated with LA </plain></SENT>
