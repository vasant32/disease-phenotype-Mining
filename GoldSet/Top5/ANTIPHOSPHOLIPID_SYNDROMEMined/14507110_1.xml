<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased fibrinogen plasma concentration (Fg) and fibrin polymerization rate (FPR) could be additional risk factors associated with atherothrombosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate Fg and FPR in consecutive patients with APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had primary APS, 13 patients had SLE, and 10 patients had SLE plus APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean of the FPR was significantly increased (0.2799 +/- 0.091) in patients with APS plus SLE as compared with the control group (0.2052 +/- 0.055) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fg was higher in APS plus SLE (3.15 g/L +/- 0.43) and in primary APS (3.03 g/L +/- 0.29) than in controls (2.87 g/L +/- 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated an increased FPR in patients with APS plus SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon could be an additional risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
