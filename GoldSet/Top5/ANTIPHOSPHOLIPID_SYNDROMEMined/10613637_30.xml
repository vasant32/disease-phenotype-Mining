<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification, we have analysed TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation in freshly isolated mononuclear blood cells (MBC) of 14 patients with primary APS (PAPS) and six <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> accumulation was low or absent in uncultured MBC from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but was elevated in uncultured MBC from nine of the patients as well as in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MBC incubated with 100 ng/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, as measured by densitometry, were higher in MBC from patients (N = 14) than in those from controls (N = 6, P = 0.009), and in MBC from patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (N = 9) than in those from patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (N = 5, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Uncultured MBC of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> accumulated TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at similar levels to LPS-treated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in eight of ten patients with conventional aPL (ie, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies [aCL] and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [LA]) and little if any accumulation of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was observed in three of four patients without aPL at the time of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that circulating monocytes of many patients with PAPS are subjected to an up-regulated TF expression that may well explain their prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the presence or absence of TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in MBC was associated with, respectively, the presence or absence of conventional aPL in 11 of the 14 patients studied, our study cannot exclude the involvement of factors other than aCL or LA in inducing TF expression </plain></SENT>
