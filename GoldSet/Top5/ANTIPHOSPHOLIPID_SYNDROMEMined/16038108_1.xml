<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used the brain perfusion index (BPI), an indicator of the average amount of cerebral blood flow (CBF), to evaluate the usefulness of the average amount of CBF for neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (NPSLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the seventy three SLE patients examined in this study (total 100 scans), 16 patients (23 scans) had already been diagnosed with NPSLE based on clinical symptoms indicative of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, 12 patients (17 scans) exhibited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BPI is significantly influenced by age and we therefore used the BPI ratio (ratio of age predicted BPI to measured BPI value) for each assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean BPI value of 100 scans was 11.2 +/- 2.79, and the mean BPI ratio was 0.99 +/- 0.24 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean BPI ratio among NPSLE (0.84 +/- 0.19) was significantly lower than that of the non-NPSLE patients (1.04 +/- 0.24) (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in the mean BPI ratio between APS patients (0.98 +/- 0.24) and non-APS patients (0.99 +/- 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the mean CBF assessed by the BPI ratio using SPECT is of use in the evaluation of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
