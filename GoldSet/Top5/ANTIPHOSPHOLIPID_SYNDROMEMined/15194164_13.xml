<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge about the role of human Fc receptors for IgG (FcgammaR) has increased considerably within the last several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These receptors vary in their affinity for IgG, their preferences for IgG subclasses, the cell type-specific expression patterns, and the intracellular signals that they elicit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional FcgammaR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is introduced by the presence of well characterized genetic polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allelic variants of FcgammaR genes may influence phagocyte biologic activity, providing a basis for inherited predisposition to disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that certain FcgammaR alleles are genetic risk factors for systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and the development of major manifestations of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FcgammaRIIA-R/H131 polymorphism is an important determinant of predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FcgammaRIIA-R131, the low-binding IgG2 allele, seems to confer risk for APS under a recessive model, whereas its effect on SLE susceptibility probably has a dose-response character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population-attributable fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> cases due to the R131 allele is 13% and for APS cases is at least 10%, in subjects of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FcgammaRIIIA-V/F158 polymorphism has a significant impact on renal involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> cases that could be attributed to the low-binding IgG1 and IgG3 F158 allele is approximately 10-14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These genetic associations have been well documented in meta-analyses including a large number of studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Besides the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic interest, this knowledge may be of use in the future in designing novel therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
