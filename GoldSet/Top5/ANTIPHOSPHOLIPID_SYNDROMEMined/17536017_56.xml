<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have shown that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, specifically activation of complement with generation of the anaphylotoxin C5a, is an essential trigger of fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the role of the procoagulant molecule tissue factor (TF) in a mouse model of aPL antibody-induced pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that either blockade of TF with a monoclonal antibody in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice or a genetic reduction of TF prevented aPL antibody-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In response to aPL antibody-generated C5a, neutrophils express TF potentiating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the deciduas and leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we showed that TF in myeloid cells but not fetal-derived cells (trophoblasts) was associated with fetal injury, suggesting that the site for pathologic TF expression is neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that TF expression in neutrophils contributes to respiratory burst and subsequent trophoblast injury and pregnancy loss induced by aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The identification of TF as an important mediator of C5a-induced oxidative burst in neutrophils in aPL-induced fetal injury provides a new target for therapy to prevent pregnancy loss in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
