<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TFPI was measured in PAPS patients using an amidolytic assay, dependent on the generation of activated factor X (Fxa), and this was compared with 55 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional levels of TFPI (mean +/- SD) were significantly lower in PAPS patients (0.89 +/- 0.37 U/ml) than the control group (1.05 +/- 0.15 U/ml) (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference was caused by a subset of five patients who had TFPI levels below the lower 99% confidence interval of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference range, representing increased FXa generation in the assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG fractions were isolated from these five patients and five control subjects, then incorporated into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma to measure FXa generation in the TFPI assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FXa generation was increased when polyclonal rabbit anti-human TFPI IgG (P &lt; 0.0001) or PAPS IgG (P = 0.0001) were added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma, demonstrating inhibition of TFPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apparent anti-TFPI activity demonstrated in the five subjects with PAPS in this study may represent a significant new mechanism for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with aPS, as it implies that increased tissue factor FVIIa-mediated thrombin generation might occur </plain></SENT>
