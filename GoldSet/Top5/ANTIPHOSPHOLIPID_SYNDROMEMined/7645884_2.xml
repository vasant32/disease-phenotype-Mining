<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, is it possible to define a group presenting clinical and biological findings suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What are the most sensitive and selective biological tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> of the inner ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Do patients with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> present a particular clinical, genetic and for biological profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to answer these questions, we retrospectively studied 35 patients followed in our service from June 1990 to August, 1992 for <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> of an unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had had a complete biological work-up including examinations which would detect <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (erythrocyte sedimentation rate immunoglobulin IgG, IgA, IgM assays, protein electrophonesis) or dysimmunity (circulating immune complexes, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of serum complement levels the presence of antinuclear antiorgan antibodies, or anticardiolipid and type II anticollagen antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA typing had also been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients had a biological profile suggesting dysimmunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients presented no common clinical or genetic characteristic which would distinguish them as a separate subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biologically, anticardiolipid antibodies were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 of these patients and only in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These 4 patients also had circulating immune complexes and 3 of the 4 patients also had elevated levels of IgA and IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IN CONCLUSION: including assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the work-up of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> could reveal an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> affecting the inner ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and agents decreasing platelet aggregation could provide effective treatment </plain></SENT>
