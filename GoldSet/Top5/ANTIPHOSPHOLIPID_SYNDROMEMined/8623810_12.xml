<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated whether immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies against phosphatidylserine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or cross-reactive with both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> would induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> in an experimental model of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Balb/c or CD-1 mice were injected intraperitoneally on day 8 of pregnancy with three immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies that differentiated between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>- and phosphatidylserine-dependent antigens or with control immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies against irrelevant antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed on day 15 of pregnancy and placental and fetal weights were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Monoclonal antibody 3SB9b, which reacted in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with phosphatidylserine but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, induced a significant reduction in both fetal and placental weights </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> that reacts with phosphatidylserine induces significant fetal and placental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> in a mouse model for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, but those that react with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> do not </plain></SENT>
