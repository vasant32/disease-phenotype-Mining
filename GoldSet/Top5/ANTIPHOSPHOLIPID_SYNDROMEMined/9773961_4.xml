<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe herein the performance characteristics of standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for anti-beta2GPI of the three major immunoglobulin classes: IgG, IgA, and IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three assays generated highly linear standard curves (5 points, r &gt; or = 0.993 for each); precision was excellent both intra-assay and run-to-run, with coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 2.3% to 6.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values for IgG anti-beta2GPI correlated strongly with those obtained by an earlier method (r = 0.80, P&lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A study group consisting of 203 healthy subjects was used to generate percentile-based reference intervals for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three classes of anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS subjects' anti-beta2GPI were found to differ significantly (P &lt;0.0001 for each) from those of the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three assays correlated well with beta2GPI-dependent anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) measurements; IgG: r = 0.94 (P &lt;0.0001), for IgA: r = 0.82 (P&lt;0.001) and for IgM: r = 0.84 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these ELISAs may provide valuable standardized measurements of IgG, IgA, and IgM anti-P2GPI </plain></SENT>
