<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the polymorphism at position 247 of the beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) gene in Mexican patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to compare these data in patients with or without antibodies to beta(2)GPI and with the clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 39 patients with primary APS and compared them with 106 clinically healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of "true" anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, beta(2)GPI-dependent aCL antibodies (IgG and IgM), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies (IgG isotype) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing nonirradiated ELISA plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the genotype expression between the control group and the primary APS patients (13% with VV, 52% with VL, and 35% with LL versus 23% with VV, 51% with VL, and 26% with LL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-beta(2)GPI-positive patients had significantly higher frequencies of the VV genotype and V allele expression than the control subjects and the anti-beta(2)GPI-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These genotype and allele frequencies were also significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> than in patients without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI-negative patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> did not express the VV genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in the Val/Leu(247) polymorphism of the beta(2)GPI gene in primary APS patients with or without "true" aCL antibodies or in primary APS patients with or without beta(2)GPI-dependent aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the VV genotype at position 247 of the beta(2)GPI gene may play a role in the generation of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and perhaps in the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in primary APS </plain></SENT>
