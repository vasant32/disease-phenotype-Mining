<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in patients with venous thromboembolic episodes should influence the duration of treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs by mouth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and a history of venous thromboembolic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow up from the first venous thromboembolic episode was 93 months and the median age at this episode was 26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients had in total 34 venous thromboembolic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total follow up period comprised 32 periods with and 23 periods without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The probability of being free of recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, was significantly influenced by the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> had at eight years a 100% probability of survival without recurrence, whereas patients in whom <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs were stopped had a 50% probability of a recurrent venous thromboembolic episode at two years, and a 78% probability of recurrence at eight years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with venous thromboembolic episodes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have a high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes and long term treatment with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs by mouth is an effective prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
