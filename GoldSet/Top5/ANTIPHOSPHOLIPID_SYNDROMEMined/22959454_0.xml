<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care fertility center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A total of 109 aPL-RM patients (aPL-RM group) and 49 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fertile women (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Uterine measurement by transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial MVD in the midluteal phase was assessed for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometrial thickness, volume, and MVD, uterine arterial pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI), and the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) of endometrial and subendometrial regions were measured on day 7 of a natural cycle after ovulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Both groups had similar endometrial thickness, volume, and MVD and uterine arterial PI and RI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endometrial VI, FI, VFI, and subendometrial FI were significantly reduced in the aPL-RM group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the uterine arterial 2D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> and endometrial-subendometrial 3D-<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> parameters correlated with the endometrial MVD in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Endometrial and subendometrial vascularity was significantly impaired in aPL-RM patients during natural midluteal phase compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fertile women, and endometrial MVD did not correlate with any of the acquired vascularity parameters </plain></SENT>
