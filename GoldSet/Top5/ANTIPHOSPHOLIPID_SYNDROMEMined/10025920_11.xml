<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine any HLA associations with anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in a large, retrospectively studied, multiethnic group of 262 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), or another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-beta2GPI antibodies were detected in sera using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA class II alleles (DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) were determined by DNA oligotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HLA-DQB1*0302 (DQ8) allele, typically carried on HLA-DR4 haplotypes, was associated with anti-beta2GPI when compared with both anti-beta2GPI-negative SLE patients and ethnically matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, especially in Mexican Americans and, to a lesser extent, in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, when ethnic groups were combined, HLA-DQB1*0302, as well as HLA-DQB1*03 alleles overall (DQB1*0301, *0302, and *0303), were strongly correlated with anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HLA-DR6 (DR13) haplotype DRB1*1302; DQB1*0604/5 was also significantly increased, primarily in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR7 was not significantly increased in any of these 3 ethnic groups, and HLA-DR53 (DRB4*0101) was increased in Mexican Americans only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Certain HLA class II haplotypes genetically influence the expression of antibodies to beta2GPI, an important <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> in the APS, but there are variations in HLA associations among different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
