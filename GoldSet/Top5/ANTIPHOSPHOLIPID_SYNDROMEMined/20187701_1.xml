<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), oxLDL molecules form complexes with beta2GPI and become target antigens for autoantibodies, which are detectable in the sera of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>oxLDL takes part in the pathogenesis of APS and in the concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, yet the exact associated immune mechanisms are not clear in details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the activation and proliferation response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with APS in the presence of oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with APS and nine healthy individuals were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Separated PBMCs of these patients were cultured in the presence of immunogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion (TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10) were assessed by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found significant PBMC proliferation in APS compared to healthy controls (PI/proliferation index/APS: 1.76 vs. PI control: 0.56; p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion were detected upon oxLDL stimulus in patients with APS compared to controls (IL-2 cytokine secretion index (CSI) APS: 278.5, IL-2 CSI controls: 65.1; p = 0.025; IFN-gamma CSI APS: 163.2, IFN-gamma CSI controls: 77.4; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, we assume that oxLDL via Th1-type cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation may contribute to the perpetuation of immune processes in APS </plain></SENT>
