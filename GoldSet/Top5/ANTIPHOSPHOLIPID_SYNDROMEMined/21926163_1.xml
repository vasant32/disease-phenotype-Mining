<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of APS pathology in BALB/c mice mainly correlates to the affinity of anti-β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2)GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated reproductive pathology induced in C57BL/6 mice by TTd hyper-immunization using a combination of different pretreatments (complete Freund's adjuvant or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>) and adjuvants (alhydrogel or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease in fecundity was recorded in only C57BL/6 mice immunized with alhydrogel adjuvant, irrespective of the kind of applied pretreatment; it was associated with an increase in abundance of low affinity anti-β(2)GPI IgG antibodies and Th1 prevalence </plain></SENT>
