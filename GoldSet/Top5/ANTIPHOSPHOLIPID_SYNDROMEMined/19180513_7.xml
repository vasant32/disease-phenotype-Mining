<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Regulation of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is critical in the control of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While several plasminogen activators have been described, soluble plasma cofactors that stimulate fibrinolysis have not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), an abundant plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, on tPA-mediated plasminogen activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effect of beta(2)GPI on tPA-mediated activation of plasminogen was assessed using amidolytic assays, a fibrin gel, and plasma clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding of beta(2)GPI to tPA and plasminogen was determined in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of IgG fractions and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) on tPA-mediated plasminogen activation were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I stimulated tPA-dependent plasminogen activation in the fluid phase and within a fibrin gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beta(2)GPI region responsible for stimulating tPA activity was shown to be at least partly contained within beta(2)GPI domain V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, beta(2)GPI bound tPA with high affinity (K(d) approximately 20 nM), stimulated tPA amidolytic activity, and caused an overall 20-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency (K(cat)/K(m)) of tPA-mediated conversion of Glu-plasminogen to plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of beta(2)GPI from plasma led to diminished rates of clot lysis, with restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lysis rates following beta(2)GPI repletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of tPA-mediated plasminogen activity by beta(2)GPI was inhibited by monoclonal anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies as well as by anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies from patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that beta(2)GPI may be an endogenous regulator of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Impairment of beta(2)GPI-stimulated fibrinolysis by anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies may contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
