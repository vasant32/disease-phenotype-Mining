<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies were measured using a commercial ELISA kit in 158 PAPS patients and in 214 control subjects (100 healthy blood donors and 114 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG/IgM aPT antibodies were significantly associated with PAPS (OR, 95% CI: 52.0, 7.0-385.5; 9.8, 1.2-80.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were found to have a high specificity (IgG 99.50%, IgM 99.54%) but a low sensitivity (IgG 19.60%, IgM 3.80%) for PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG aPT antibodies were significantly higher in the PAPS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 95% CI: 69.2, 9.2-519.1) as well as in those with pregnancy morbidity alone (OR, 95% CI: 20.5, 2.4-174.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IgG aPT was not significantly different in the thrombotic and obstetric patients, and the presence of IgM aPT antibodies was significant only in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 95% CI: 2.6, 1.6-110.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings confirm that IgG/IgM aPT antibodies are significantly associated with PAPS and indicate that IgG aPT antibodies are associated with clinical subsets of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the time being, however, the lower sensitivity of IgG/IgM antibodies with respect to conventional aPL antibodies precludes their inclusion in the recommendations for the diagnosis of PAPS </plain></SENT>
