<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-related disorders in women with elevated levels of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used an historic cohort study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surveys of medical and obstetric histories for the interval from initial antibody testing to the time of patient interview were used to calculate age-adjusted rates for the development of medical disorders associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort included 130 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, medium to high levels of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median interval of study was 3.2 years (range 0.7-9.5, mean 3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three subjects (48%) developed at least one new disorder during the study interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted rates (per 1000 patient-years; +/- standard error) for the development of the disorders studied were as follows: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (156.8 +/- 30.0), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (93.8 +/- 25.1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (57.1 +/- 23.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (170.4 +/- 27.6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (9.8 +/- 3.8), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (56.0 +/- 22.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 thrombotic events that occurred during the study interval, eight were associated with pregnancy and eight occurred while the patients were taking <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our subjects developed complications associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> at a substantial rate, and almost half suffered at least one new event during the study interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, especially associated with pregnancy, underscores the need to evaluate long-term anticoagulation in these patients </plain></SENT>
