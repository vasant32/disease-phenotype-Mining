<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A third to half of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> have valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The echocardiographic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were analyzed, and the utility of treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and/or antiplatelet agents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>) is examined with the use of transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of valvular lesions after 1 year of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients, 22 women and 7 men with average age of 35.4 years, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before beginning <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Valve lesions were found in 22 (75.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were found in 3 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 (24.1%) cases, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormality</z:hpo> was detected, although in 1 of these, alterations in left ventricular segmental wall movement secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One year after initiation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or antiplatelet therapy, it was possible to perform transesophageal echocardiograms on 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No modification of valve lesions was found in 6 (46.2%) cases; new lesions had appeared in the remaining 7 (53.8%) as well as left ventricular apical akinesis in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the predominant heart lesion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is valvular; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or antiplatelet treatment does not diminish the noninfective valve lesions, and on occasion this entity may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> despite angiographically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
