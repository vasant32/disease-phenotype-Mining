<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also there are no such studies available in pediatric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the prevalence and clinical significance of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> were investigated in pediatric patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients (age 2-13 years) were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients (27.5%) were LA positive at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the LA-positive and LA-negative groups regarding gender, initial platelet counts, or response to <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months of follow up, 5 of the 11 LA-positive cases were still positive for LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of LA positivity found in this pediatric age group was similar to that reported in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In view of the fact that in adult patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, the persistent presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> is an important risk factor for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, the same may also hold true for pediatric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, and thus 'demands long term follow up for these patients </plain></SENT>
