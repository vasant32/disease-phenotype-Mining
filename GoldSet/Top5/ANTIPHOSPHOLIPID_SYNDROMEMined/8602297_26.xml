<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the implications of low levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)-G or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women who underwent clinically indicated testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were divided into four groups based on results: 1) high-positive (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or more than 19 IgG binding units of anticardiolipin antibodies; N = 131), 2) low-positive IgG (fewer than 20 IgG binding units; N 93), 3) IgM only (more than nine IgM binding units; N 97), and 4) negative (N = 153) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-related disorders was assessed for the time interval from initial antibody testing to patient interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median study interval for each group was at least 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five percent of women had repeat testing at the time of interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women in the high-positive group were more likely to develop at least one new medical complication than those in the low-positive IgG (odds ratio [OR] 4.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-10.03), IgM only (OR 6.00, 95% CI 2.65-13.59), and negative (OR 9.11, 95% CI 3.92-21.2) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the low-positive IgG, IgM only, and negative groups had similar risks for the development of new disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 129 (9.3%) women in the low-positive IgG, IgM only, or negative groups had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or more than 19 IgG binding units on retesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Half of these women developed at least one new disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women with IgM or low levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies comprise distinct populations from those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or moderate to high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These women are not at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-related disorders beyond the risk conferred by their medical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, repeat testing is warranted with new or recurrent clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
