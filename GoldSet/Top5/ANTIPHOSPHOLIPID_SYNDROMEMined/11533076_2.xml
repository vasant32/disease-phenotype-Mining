<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Three representative commercial ACL ELISAs and an in house beta2gp1 assay were optimised and then assessed on 124 sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, or patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Medline search was screened for papers meeting defined criteria to conduct a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance of the assays used in this study was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A non-quantitative ACL assay performed at least as well as the anti-beta2gp1 assay in the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis confirmed that neither assay is perfect, although the anti-beta2gp1 assay had a higher specificity and lower sensitivity than the ACL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pooled data suggest that the ACL assay is used to investigate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without overt underlying pathology and that the improved specificity of the anti-beta2gp1 assay is exploited where <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e>, or atheroma are present </plain></SENT>
