<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies in rheumatologic and hematologic populations suggest that anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies are more specific for the clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> than anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and pregnancy loss remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I is associated with the obstetric features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Sera from 4 groups of women were studied: (1) 152 healthy fertile control subjects, (2) 141 subjects with unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, (3) 58 subjects with unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and (4) 73 subjects with well-characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> had significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I than the other 3 groups (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, women in the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo>, fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and fertile control groups had similar levels of each antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there were no differences in the proportion of women with positive test results for each autoantibody in these 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis showed significant correlation between anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G and beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I immunoglobulin G (R (2) = 0.544786, P =.0001) and anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M and beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I immunoglobulin M (R (2) = 0.525048, P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, testing for anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I does not identify additional patients with either recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> or unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> who initially have negative test responses for anticardiolipin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is likely because of the strong correlation between the 2 autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data do not support routine testing for anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I in addition to testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in women with recurrent pregnancy loss and unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
