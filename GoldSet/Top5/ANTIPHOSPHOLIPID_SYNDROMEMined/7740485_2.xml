<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five asymptomatic individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) (A-aPL) and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and controls plasmas were added (1:20 v/v) to anticoagulated blood and perfused through annular chambers containing collagen rich vessel segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction of platelets with vessel subendothelium was morphometrically evaluated in thin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase in both covered surface and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formation was observed in perfusions in the presence of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-plasma (mean +/- SD: 34.2% +/- 9.6% and 23.2% +/- 10.0% respectively) compared with control plasmas (21.4% +/- 7.3% and 10.1% +/- 7.7%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anticardiolipin antibodies from one <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> patient showed a similar effect when added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, A-aPL plasma had no effect on platelet-subendothelium interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel studies, the same plasmas were incubated with isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets before and after activation with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> or collagen and the binding of immunoglobulins (Ig) was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased binding of Ig was observed in 8 out of 9 plasmas from <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> patients when platelets had been activated with collagen but not when resting or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> activated platelets were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No increased Ig binding to platelets was seen using A-aPL individuals plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations might help to explain the pathophysiology of the thrombotic events occurring in patients with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
