<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At this stage of disease, it is common to find large benign hepatocellular nodules (LBHNs) of undetermined cause that may be confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with indications for liver transplantation are currently classified according to the MELD (Model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">End-Stage Liver Disease</z:e>) severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When they fit Barcelona and Milan eligibility criteria for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>, they receive 20 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, misdiagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> leads to a privileged position on the waiting list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, we have reported three BCS cases of cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation; the pathologic results of their explanted livers showed LBHN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed three of 489 OLT who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) the first case: was a 19-year-old man, with BCS of undetermined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second 20-year-old female patients displayed BCS due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> the third, 45-year-old man had CVOO diagnosed preliminarily due to cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> in the explanted liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the three cases, the nodules in the explant measured 0.5 to 2.4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the first case, the diagnosis was not in doubt; in the second case, 23 nodules were confused with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> histologic evaluation, and in the third case three larger hypervascular nodules were misdiagnosed as <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> in the preoperative period despite low alpha-fetoprotein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion it is fundamental to recognize these benign lesions so as to avoid misdiagnosis, thereby allowing the proper selection of candidates for liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
