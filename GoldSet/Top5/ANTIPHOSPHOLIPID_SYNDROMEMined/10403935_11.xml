<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mice with experimental anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), induced by active immunization with a human anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> MoAb (H-3), were treated with mouse anti-idiotypic MoAb (anti-H3, named S2.9) and with an irrelevant anti-idiotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunized mice produced high titres of mouse anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies along with clinical manifestations of experimental APS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (aPTT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and high rate of fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the specific anti-Id (S2.9) as a whole molecule or F(ab)2 fraction, resulted in a decrease in serum levels of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, rise in platelet count, shortened aPTT and reduced rate of fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti-Id effect was associated with a rise in the number of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-secreting cells (Th1) and reduction in IL-4- and IL-6-secreting cells (Th2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of the anti-Id treatment in mice with experimental APS induced by active immunization with an idiotype further supports the idiotypic aetiology of experimental APS and points to the role of Th1 cytokines in suppression of its manifestations </plain></SENT>
