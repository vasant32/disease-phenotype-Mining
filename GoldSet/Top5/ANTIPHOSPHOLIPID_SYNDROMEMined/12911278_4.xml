<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured and compared the levels of plasma monocyte-derived microparticles (MDMPs), platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs), and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibody, to develop a better understanding of their potential contribution to vascular complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of MDMP in APS patients was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When levels of PDMPs and plt-P-selectin were compared between the control and APS patients, levels of PDMPs and plt-P-selectin were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01 for each) in APS patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, these levels of platelet activation markers correlated with MDMP in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty one of the 37 APS patients (56.8%) had elevated levels of anti-oxLDL antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant increase in MDMP was observed in anti-oxLDL antibody-positive APS patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated MDMPs may be a sign of vascular complication in APS patients, particularly those who are detected anti-oxLDL antibodies </plain></SENT>
