<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to localize the defect, the levels of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were measured from dot blots of total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this preliminary study, eleven patients with SLE and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were compared to three controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the mean levels of specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were ten fold lower in the PBL from SLE patients compared to controls and no overlap of values was seen between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No such decrease was seen in the PBL from the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the defect in poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase metabolism that is seen in SLE patients occurs at the level of transcription or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> turnover </plain></SENT>
