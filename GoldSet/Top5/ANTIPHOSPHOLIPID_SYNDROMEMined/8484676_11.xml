<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients referred to the coagulation and haemostasis service of a general hospital for the first determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies) and newly diagnosed disorders (for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, thrombotic disorders, and unexplained repeated abortions) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined by two dermatologists according to predefined criteria, and information about general characteristics and relevant dermatological and medical histories were collected using an ad hoc questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was limited to patients without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 patients was examined; 13 subjects were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anticardiolipin antibodies, or both (cases), and 22 were negative (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001063'>acrocyanosis</z:hpo> were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, with relative risks of 13.1 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 149.0) and 8.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 65.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Capillaritis</z:e> was also associated with the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> were more common in cases than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence of the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> with several cutaneous diseases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> seem to play a major part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that these manifestations might appear early in the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
