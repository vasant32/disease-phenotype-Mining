<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We studied the influence of different binding conditions on the interaction between high- or low-avidity IgG anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) and beta2-GPI, which was either free in solution or bound to microtitre plates or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> were selected on the basis of anti-beta2-GPI positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Avidity of IgG anti-beta2-GPI was determined by chaotropic ELISA, using increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> concentration during the antibody binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunodetection on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> membrane followed reducing or non-reducing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In converted, non-reducing PAGE, the preparation with high-affinity Fab fragments (obtained by papain digestion) was subjected to electrophoresis, while purified beta2-GPI was used as the sample in immunodetection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies of high, low or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (low and high) avidity were found in 5/30, 9/30 and 16/30 sera, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The density of beta2-GPI, which was 20-30 times higher on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> membrane than on the surface of ELISA plates, was not sufficient for the recognition of the antigen by anti-beta2-GPI: 2/5 high-avidity samples reacted only with non-reduced beta2-GPI, 3/9 low-avidity samples recognized only denatured and reduced beta2-GPI, and 1/16 samples with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>-avidity antibodies reacted with reduced and non-reduced beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neither high density of the antigen nor high avidity of the antibodies (or Fab fragments) alone was sufficient for the binding of anti-beta2-GPI to beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some conformational modifications and, consequently, exposed neo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> are required for the recognition of beta2-GPI by polyclonal anti-beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
