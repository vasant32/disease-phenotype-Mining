<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), especially anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), antibodies against beta2-glikoprotein I and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> leads to thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic role of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in children is not exactly explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occurrence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and antiphospholipid syndrom in children is 2 to 3 times lower than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to indicate the presence of ACA in circulating immunological complexes (CIC) from sera of patients suffering from juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e>) and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (JSLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 31 sera were investigated, 16 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> patients and 15 from JSLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The free ACA IgG class, ACA bound in CIC were estimated by the ELISA method (after dissociation of CIC and y-fraction paecipitation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CIC isolated from sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> and JSLE patients ACA were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACA, possessing high avidity, in CIC were more frequently discovered than unbound ACA (38.7% vs. 25.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACA in CIC were more frequent in sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> patients, unbound ACA were more frequent in sera of JSLE patients </plain></SENT>
