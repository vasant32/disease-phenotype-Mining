<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether comorbidity as assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is associated with mortality in a long-term followup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected from 499 SLE patients attending the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Clinic at the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and 170 SLE patients from the Department of Rheumatology at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This included data on comorbidity, demographics, disease activity, the Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables were entered into a Cox proportional hazards survival model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality risk in the Montreal cohort was associated with the CCI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.57 per unit increase in the CCI, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-2.09) and age (HR 1.04 per year increase in age, 95% CI 1.00-1.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CCI and age at diagnosis were also associated with mortality in the Lund cohort (CCI: HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.60; age: HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the SDI was associated with mortality in the Lund cohort (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19-1.64), while a wide CI for the estimate in the Montreal cohort prevented a definitive conclusion (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not find a strong association between mortality and sex, race/ethnicity, disease activity, or APS in either cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, comorbidity as measured by the CCI was associated with decreased survival independent of age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus disease</z:e> activity, and damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the CCI may be useful in capturing comorbidity for clinical research in SLE </plain></SENT>
