<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the relationship of aPLAb to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained from 87 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (74 +/- 11 years old) and 69 controls (78 +/- 9 years old), residents of an old age home who were not overtly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of aPLAb were measured by a standardized ELISA, utilizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> as antigen, and we considered levels above 20 IgG antiphospholipid units (GPLU) as significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that 5 of the 87 demented patients (6%), but none of the 69 controls, had significantly elevated aPLAb levels (p = 0.03, one-tailed Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients with high aPLAb levels were diagnosed clinically as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> of the Alzheimer type, except for 1 who had mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and none had features of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated disease</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a small but significant number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have high levels of aPLAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of the aPLAb in these patients, with apparently diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e>, is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
