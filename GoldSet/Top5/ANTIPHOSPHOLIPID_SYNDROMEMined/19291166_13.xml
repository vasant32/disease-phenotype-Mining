<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) have been reported with positive tests for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex antibodies by antigen assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether such patients can be treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is a dilemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and nature of the HIT immune reaction in patients with APS and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex were assayed by particle gel immunoassay (PaGIA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with or without an excess of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EIA for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> alone was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional assays for HIT, that is, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced platelet activation (HIPA) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation, were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 32 of 42 patients (76.2%) with APS, APS and SLE, SLE, or SLE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, EIA IgG or PaGIA for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex antibodies were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 32 samples, 26 (81.3%) tested positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 24 samples that were positive for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complex by EIA IgG were also positive for EIA IgG in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> excess, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were negative by the HIPA and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients with APS and/or SLE give false-positive HIT antigen test results that are presumably related to autoantibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>, which can be distinguished from true HIT antibodies by EIA for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> complexes tested with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> excess, and by functional assays </plain></SENT>
