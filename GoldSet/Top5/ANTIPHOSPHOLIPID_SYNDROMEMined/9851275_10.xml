<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether multiple aPL tests have enhanced diagnostic value for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested IgG/M/A aPS, aPI, aPA, aPC and aPE by ELISA using 10% bovine serum as blocking and sample diluent in 26 SLE patients with clinical manifestations of APS, but negative for both aCL and LA (Group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with 32 SLE patients without any features of APS (Group 2) and 24 SLE patients with APS (aCL and/or LA positive) (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, 1/26 (4%) was positive for IgA aPE, less frequent than in other groups, and none of the patients had any other aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, 1/32 (3%) was positive for aPS, two (6%) for aPI, one (3%) for aPA and four (12.5%) for aPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None was positive for aPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third group, 13/24 (54%) were positive for aPS, 11 (46%) for aPI, 15 (63%) for aPA, four (17%) for aPC and seven (29%) for aPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since aPE was found in some patients, we extended the study, including 207 SLE patients, and tested aPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IgG/M/A aPE was found in six (3%), 10(5%) and 21 (10%), respectively, but no association was found between aPE and any clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that screening by multiple aPL tests does not increase the diagnostic yield in APS </plain></SENT>
