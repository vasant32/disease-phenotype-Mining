<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For aCL determinations, a beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-dependent enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was investigated by Russell venom time with platelet neutralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> were performed by standardized methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SLE patients (from a total of 137) with aCL determinations who were assayed before and after MP and CYC pulse therapy were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients had aCL determinations before and after MP-CYC pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> active patients with SLE improved clinically without severe MP-CYC side effects; 21 had IgG-aCL determinations, and 19 IgM-aCL determinations (40 assays) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients during the observation period (zero time to 21 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS)-related clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, IgG aCL antibodies decreased significantly (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of IgG aCL serum levels as a consequence of the MP-CYC therapy herein reported might help to redefine previous concepts with regard to modulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) immune response by immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings might also have prognostic and therapeutic implications in SLE, on pregnancy in SLE, and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APL) as well, although prospective studies are required </plain></SENT>
