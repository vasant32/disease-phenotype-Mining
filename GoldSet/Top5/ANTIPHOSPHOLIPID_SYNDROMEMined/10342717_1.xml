<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A human IgM monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody - BH1 - has previously been described, which has characteristics typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the serum of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears to be idiotypically distinct from other human monoclonal autoantibodies of different or overlapping ligand-binding specificities derived from patients with related conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine whether the idiotype of BH1 is expressed on particular populations of antibodies (antiphospholipid and anti-beta2-glucoprotein I) in the serum of patients with APS and other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from patients with APS (9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> without APS ('uncomplicated SLE' -9), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA 15), and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (15) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI), and a polyclonal anti-idiotype raised against BH1 (RIdBH1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absorption experiments were subsequently performed on selected sera using micelles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight out of nine patients with APS were positive for binding to RIdBH1 (IgG and/or IgM), while only one patient with uncomplicated SLE and none of the patients with RA or the healthy controls were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients with APS were positive for binding to beta2GPI, there was poor correlation between these results and levels of binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and RIdBH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absorption of sera from patients with APS by cardolipin micelles resulted in a median reduction in IgG anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI activity of 81.6% and 6.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For those sera positive for IgG reactivity with RIdBH1 the median reduction in this activity was 79.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies eluted from selected micelles showed activity against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, beta2GPI and RIdBH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three anticardiolipin-positive sera from patients with RA were similarly absorbed; however the eluted antibodies failed to bind to RIdBH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Absorption of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these sera with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> resulted in no significant reduction in any of these activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The BH1 idiotype defines a population of serum antibodies associated with features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The antibody response in this condition, though diverse, may include the expression of a restricted group of variable region genes </plain></SENT>
