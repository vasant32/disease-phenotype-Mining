<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) and its metabolites move from mitochondria to other cellular membranes during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptor-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate the immunoreactivity to CL derivatives occurring during endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the serum immunoreactivity to CL with that of its derivatives monolysocardiolipin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>), dilysocardiolipin (DCL), and hydrocardiolipin (HCL) by means of both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated the composition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> extracts from the plasma membrane of apoptotic endothelial cells and the binding of patients' sera to the surface of the same cells by using high-performance TLC and immunofluorescence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average reactivity to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> was comparable with that of CL and significantly higher than that for DCL and HCL in patients studied, both in the presence or in the absence of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of relevance for the pathogenic role of these autoantibodies, immunoglobulin G from patients' sera showed an increased focal reactivity with the plasma membrane of endothelial cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> analysis of these light membrane fractions showed an accumulation of both CL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that a critical number of acyl chains in CL derivatives is important for the binding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> is an antigenic target with immunoreactivity comparable with CL in APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our finding also suggests a link between apoptotic perturbation of CL metabolism and the production of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
