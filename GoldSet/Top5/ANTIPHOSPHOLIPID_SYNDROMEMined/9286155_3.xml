<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The combination of generalized broken ("racemose") livedo and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> is referred to as "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several pathogenetic factors have been suggested the aetiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, considerable variability of patient characteristics gives rise to the question whether "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>" denotes a homogeneous disease entity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the diagnosis "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>" can be broken down into different subgroups according to possible aetiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with the combination of generalized broken livedo and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> were evaluated by clinical examination, routine diagnostic procedures, MRI of the brain, echocardiography, vascular ultrasound, immunologic and haemostaseologic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient groups were formed, depending on (1) whether or not an additional feature with a possibly aetiologic role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> was present, and (2) which kind of feature it was </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 16 out of 32 patients, diagnostic features with an implication for the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> was diagnosed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A thrombophilic state was detected in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered from an embolizing <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extent and kind of cerebral pathology differed between patient groups as did the kind of cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> is not a homogeneous disease entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients should be classified as "primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>" if no aetiologic factor can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On clinical grounds, this from differs from several varieties of "secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>" which occurs mainly as part of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> or in a thrombophilic state </plain></SENT>
