<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It must be clinically distinguished from cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man presented pain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e> involving the lower limbs, hands and trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruption</z:e> predominated on the feet with purpuric lesions producing a livedoid pattern, ulcerations on both ankles and white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001075'>atrophic scars</z:hpo> on the dorsum of the feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy showed dermic vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without leukocytoclasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These features favored livedoid vasculopathy rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was started on antithrombotic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001209'>skin ulcerations</z:mp> regressed and no recurrence has been observed at 7-months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Livedoid vasculopathy is characterized by painful purpuric lesions that generally occur on the lower limbs, and frequently ulcerate and heal leaving porcelain white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001075'>atrophic scars</z:hpo> (atrophic blanche) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The histology evidences a thrombotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Livedoid vasculopathy is normally described as occurring as a sole entity, however thera have been reports of an association with anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggest a possible link with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
