<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a screening study of singleton pregnancies at 11-13 weeks including 1,426 (2.4%) cases that subsequently developed PE and 57,458 cases that were unaffected by PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a survival time model for the time of delivery for PE in which Bayes' theorem was used to combine the prior information from maternal characteristics with the uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and the mean arterial pressure (MAP), using multiple of the median values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk for PE increased with maternal age, weight, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian racial origin, previous pregnancy with PE, conception by in vitro fertilization and a medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In pregnancies with PE, there was an inverse correlation between multiple of the median values of the uterine artery PI and MAP with gestational age at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening by maternal characteristics, uterine artery PI and MAP detected 90% of PE cases requiring delivery before 34 weeks and 57% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PE cases at a fixed false-positive rate of 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A new model has been developed for effective first-trimester screening for PE </plain></SENT>
