<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, such as those directed against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI), are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, possess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity and recognize their target antigen only when bound to specific surfaces or to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether both free and antibody-bound beta2GPI circulate in APS, we set up an ELISA to detect [IgG anti-beta2GPI-beta2GPI] immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this system, rabbit anti-human beta2GPI antibodies were adsorbed onto plastic plates, incubated with patient plasma, and bound complexes were detected by means of alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-human IgG; each assay was stopped when positive controls consisting of in vitro generated immune complexes reached an Optical Density (OD) of 0.5 at 405 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma from 16 patients with APS showed a mean OD405 of 0.291 (range 0.115-0.558), not statistically different from the mean obtained for 15 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (mean OD405 = 0.169, range 0.066-0.264) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, levels of immune complexes in 14 patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and no circulating anti-beta2GPI antibodies were statistically higher (mean OD405 = 0.552, range 0.204-0.991) than those of healthy subjects and patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that while autoantibodies to beta2GPI are mainly unbound in plasma of patients with APS, they are complexed with their antigen in patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, possibly reflecting a higher binding affinity </plain></SENT>
