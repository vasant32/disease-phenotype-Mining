<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different methods - both homemade and commercial - for the detection of aPT are available, but they seem to produce conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of different assays on a set of well-characterized serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera were gathered from 4 FIRMA institutions, and distributed to 15 participating centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five samples were from patients positive for LA and/or anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) with or without APS, and 15 were from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The samples were evaluated for IgG and IgM antibodies using a homemade direct aPT assay (method 1), a homemade phosphatidylserine-dependent aPT assay (aPS/PT, method 2), and two different commercial kits (methods 3 and 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a commercial kit for the detection of IgG-A-M aPT (method 5) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inter-laboratory results for the 5 methods were not always comparable when different methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good inter-assay concordance was found for IgG antibodies evaluated using methods 1, 3, and 4 (Cohen k &gt; 0.4), while the IgM results were discordant between assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy losses, method 5 performed better than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While aPT and aPS/PT assays could be of interest from a clinical perspective, their routine performance cannot yet be recommended because of problems connected with the reproducibility and interpretation of the results </plain></SENT>
