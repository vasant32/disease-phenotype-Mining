<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the common beta2GPI Valine/Leucine247 (Val/Leu247) polymorphism could be found more commonly in APS and might influence the generation of anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we studied beta2GPI Val/Leu247 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by PCR in 338 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (46 with secondary and 84 with primary APS) and 147 sex and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies (both IgG and IgM) were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and controls were Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of the SNP genotypes in patients did not depart from genetic equilibrum and did not differ from those found in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no association between the presence of beta2GPI Val/Leu247genotypes and the presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2GPI antibodies or clinical APS symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, among the exclusively Caucasian, Polish population of autoimmune patients beta2GPI Val/Leu247SNP has the same distribution as in healthy subjects and does not influence the production of anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
