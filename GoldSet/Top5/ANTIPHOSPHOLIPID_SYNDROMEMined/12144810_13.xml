<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies are associated with an increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and recurrent foetal loss in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Crystallographic analysis of beta2GPI showed that its five complement control protein (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi>) or 'sushi' domains are arranged in an elongated, fish-hook shape; yet the domain-specific location of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by these autoantibodies has remained the subject of considerable controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigators have used different forms of recombinant beta2GPI and different ELISA methods to obtain conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group mapped autoimmune <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> to domain I using deletion mutants of beta2GPI in a competitive inhibition ELISA on NUNC Maxisorp microplates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another group mapped <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> to domain IV using beta2GPI with mutations in domain IV in a direct binding ELISA on polyoxygenated microplates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In an effort to resolve these discrepancies, a collaboration between the groups compared <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> beta2GPI with domain IV mutants in both types of ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies bound very poorly to domain IV mutants coated on polyoxygenated plates, yet they bound very well to the same mutants coated on NUNC Maxisorp plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The amount of protein adsorbed on to both types of plates was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the competitive inhibition ELISA, no difference could be detected between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> beta2GPI and domain IV mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the orientation of beta2GPI on the microplate, and not necessarily the lateral density, plays the predominant role in the binding of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
