<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We followed up a total of 280 patients with SLE and 74 patients with primary APS; 96 of 280 SLE patients were males and 184 of them were females, mean age--31.2 +/- 11.1, mean disease duration--8.6 +/- 7.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The APS group consisted of 15 males and 59 females, mean age--35.6 +/- 7.2, mean disease duration--11.9 +/- 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and lupous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) were determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to IgM beta 2-GP I (IgM anti-beta-GP I) were determined for 102 patients and antibodies to IgG anti beta 2-GP I were determined for 153 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of antibodies to beta 2 GP I in blood serum was found by immune-enzyme assay (QUNTA Life) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary APS was diagnosed in 115 (41%) patients from among 280 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with SLE and without APS and the group with primary APS were age-matched, however, patients with APS were older and had a longer disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made in one half of patients with primary APS in 6 and more years after the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic complications were found in 117 (42%) from among 280 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were encountered reliably more often in APS versus SLE (chi 2 = 131, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in veins of lower extremities prevailed in APS, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the surface shin veins was predominant in patients without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An important features of APS is occlusion of veins located in the liver with a subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (9 patients); in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> veins (13 patients); <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in axillary veins (7 patients) and in abdominal-cavity veins (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Loss of pregnancy at various gestational stages was registered in medical histories of 83 (76%) from among 109 pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequency rate of fetus loss was higher in primary APS (32 of 40 cases) versus its secondary variation (49 of 75 cases) with chi 2 = 8.3, p = 0.004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was detected reliably more often in patients with secondary APS (chi 2 = 36, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical signs of both primary and secondary APS were found to be similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, arterial and venous thromboses combined with the relapsing syndrome of fetus loss were more often registered in primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The detection of highly positive aCL titers is of a significant diagnostic value versus the detection of its low- and mean-positive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The study of anti-beta 2-GP I is also of certain importance for a more reliable diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
