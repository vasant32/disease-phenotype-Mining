<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsies from eight patients with APS were examined by light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, and the clinical presentation ranged from fulminant multi-system disease to isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By light microscopy, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">hexamine</z:chebi> silver stain showed a combination of glomerular basement membrane wrinkling and reduplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By electron microscopy, redundant, wrinkled segments of basement membrane were accompanied by a 'new' straighter thin basement membrane adjacent to the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two cases the presence of these antibodies was not suspected clinically, and there was no clinical history or evidence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe a distinctive glomerular lesion that represents an unexplained form of endothelial injury in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
