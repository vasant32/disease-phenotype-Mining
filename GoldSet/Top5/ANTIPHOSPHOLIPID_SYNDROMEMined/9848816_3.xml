<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Old age is usually considered to be a risk factor for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, in conjunction with other factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, major surgery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, long-term immobilization, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk factors, especially inherited deficiencies in coagulation inhibitors, also play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but these are usually diagnosed in thrombophilic patients before the age of 50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The factor V Q506 mutation, responsible for activated protein C resistance, was recently linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the prevalence of biological risk factors in older hospital patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 2-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ivry sur Seine (Paris), France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine geriatric patients (60 women and 19 men, mean age 83+/-6.8 years, range 70-102 years) who had had at least one proven episode of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were enrolled over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antithrombin (AT), protein C (PC), and protein S (PS) levels were determined in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The factor V Q506 mutation was detected on genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was detected in two women, one of whom also had a high level of anticardiolipin IgG, leading to the diagnosis of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No hereditary deficiency in AT, PC, or PS was found, but one patient had an acquired AT deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, nine of the 79 patients (11.4%, six women and three men) were heterozygous for the factor V Q506 mutation, although none were homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only major risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> identified in these patients was prolonged immobilization in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four of the nine patients who were heterozygous for the factor V Q506 mutation had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and two of these patients had been immobilized for long periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that hereditary deficiencies in coagulation inhibitors, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, are rarely involved in the pathogenesis of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in older subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the factor V Q506 mutation was frequently associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (11.4% of our patients) and should, therefore, be considered an important risk factor in the older people </plain></SENT>
