<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tissue factor (TF) is the main initiator of the coagulation cascade and elements that may upregulate its expression might provoke thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> characterized by a high TF expression in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in TF expression and to evaluate their levels in SLE and APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An in silico search was performed to find potential putative binding sites of miRNAs in TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro validation was performed transfecting cells expressing TF (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-MB-231) with oligonucleotide miRNA precursors and inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, reporter assays were performed to test for the binding of miR-20a to TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of miRNAs and TF were measured by quantitative (qRT-PCR) in patients with APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of miRNA precursors, but not inhibitors, of two of the members of cluster miR-17âˆ¼92, for example miR-19b and miR-20a, in cells expressing TF decreased TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein levels, and procoagulant activity between 30% and 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reporter assays showed that miR-20a binds to TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we measured levels of miR-19b and miR-20a in monocytes from patients with APS and SLE and observed significantly lower miRNAs levels in comparison with healthy subjects inversely correlated with the levels of TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of miR-19b and miR-20a observed in patients with SLE and APS could contribute to increased TF expression and thus provoke the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> characteristic of these patients </plain></SENT>
