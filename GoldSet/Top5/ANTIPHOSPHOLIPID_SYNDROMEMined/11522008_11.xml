<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies from our laboratories have indicated that the immunodominant binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) for high titer, affinity purified antibodies from 11 APS patients are localized to the amino terminal domain (domain 1) of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study employed surface plasmon resonance to localize the immunodominant domain in serum samples from a large cohort of patients with GPL values ranging from 21 to 230 units (n = 106 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent of patients showed &gt; or = threefold selectivity for beta2-GPI containing domain 1 relative to the domain deletion mutant that lacked domain 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The domain 1 binding activity in patient serum was abolished by removing the IgG fraction from the serum and the binding activity could be fully reconstituted with the IgG fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, analysis of serum samples from a large cohort of APS patients indicates that the immunodominant binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) for anti-beta2 antibodies are localized to the amino terminal domain of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
