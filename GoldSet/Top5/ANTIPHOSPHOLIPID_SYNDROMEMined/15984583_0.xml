<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aPE were found in 10 (46%) out of 22 aKL- and LA-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the aPE-positive patients there was a higher incidence of cortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (53% vs. 8%, p = 0.02), the widening of cortical sulci, detected by means of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (73% vs. 31%, p = 0.05), and mild renal syndrome (73% vs. 16%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that aPE detection, performed in addition to detection of classic immunological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> markers (aKL and LA), increases the portion of aPE-positive patients with SS by 33% </plain></SENT>
