<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Few studies have addressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) among children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to analyze the clinical and laboratory manifestations in a pediatric APS cohort and to assess the influence of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> factors on the outcome of children with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter study of children with APS who had no previous systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their clinical and laboratory data, including hereditary thrombophilic deficits and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort comprised 28 patients (17 females, mean +/- SD age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 10.6 +/- 6.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common initial manifestations of APS were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was detected in 96% of those tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean +/- SD followup of 5.7 +/- 4.8 years, 16 children (57.1%) had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease, 9 exhibited hematologic involvement, and 5 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> females) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None had renal, heart, or new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of 24 patients exhibiting vascular thrombotic events had recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infants with perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had monophasic disease, and other manifestations of APS did not develop later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was more common in children who experienced a single episode of APS (8 [53.3%] of 15 patients) than in those who experienced recurrences (2 [28.6%] of 7 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, only 2 patients in the latter group (28.6%) received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> after the first manifestation, compared with 12 (70.6%) of the 17 patients without recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS in children has unique features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SLE may develop in a significant percentage of girls presenting with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> did not predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo>, whereas the preventive impact of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment following the first thrombotic event was noteworthy </plain></SENT>
