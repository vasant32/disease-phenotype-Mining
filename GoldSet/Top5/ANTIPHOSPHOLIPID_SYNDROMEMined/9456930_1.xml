<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of our institution's clinical coagulation and immunology laboratories' records of patients examined from January 1993 to January 1996 revealed 1290 patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized records of radiologic studies were reviewed for evidence of thrombotic events, which were found in 93 patients (49 males and 44 females; average age, 40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anatomic distribution of thrombotic events was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (59%; 29 males and 26 females; average age, 44.2 years) had solely venous thromboses, 26 patients (28%; 15 males and 11 females; average age, 33.1 years) had solely arterial thromboses, and 12 (13%; 5 males and 7 females; average age, 35.4 years) had both types of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) of the legs was the most common finding, occurring in 45 patients (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had recurrent DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other sites of venous thrombotic events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, 30 patients (32%); thoracic veins (superior vena cava, subclavian vein, or jugular vein), 10 patients (11%); and abdominal or pelvic veins, 18 events in 11 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sites of arterial thromboses included arteries supplying the upper limbs (great vessels arising from the aorta or the brachial, radial, ulnar, or digital arteries), 15 events in 12 patients (13%); aorta, one patient (1%); abdominal or pelvic arteries, 11 events in eight patients (9%); and arteries supplying the lower limbs (femoral or popliteal arteries), seven patients (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Venous thromboses were more common than arterial thromboses in our patient group, with DVT being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, thromboses in sites that are unusual for the general population were also relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> should be suspected in patients with thromboses in unusual sites or recurrent thromboses of an otherwise unexplained cause </plain></SENT>
