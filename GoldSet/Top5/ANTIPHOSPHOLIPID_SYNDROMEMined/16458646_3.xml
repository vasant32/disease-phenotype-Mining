<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study in a third-level teaching hospital, including 75 patients: 25 pregnant patients having the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and carrying their pregnancies until 26 weeks' gestation or later (group 1); 25 pregnant patients having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> term pregnancies and delivery and no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (group 2); and 25 pregnant patients being diagnosed as having severe pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> but testing negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemostatic evaluation was carried out from patients in groups 1 and 2 between 6 and 10 weeks, between 18 and 22 weeks, and between 28 and 32 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 3 were sampled between 28 and 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional blood sample was obtained 4 to 6 months after delivery (baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U test, the Friedman test, and the chi2 test were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in group 1 were characterized by increased factor VIIa levels, increased prothrombin fragment 1+2 levels, reduced factor XIIa levels, diminished functional urokinase-type plasminogen activator levels, and decreased levels of plasmin/alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were more evident in patients in group 1 developing pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impaired factor XIIa-dependent activation of fibrinolysis seems to be a key mechanism related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late-pregnancy</z:e> complications in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
