<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to establish if neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (NPSLE) can be identified by any characteristic other than those used to diagnose the neuropsychiatric (NP) disease itself, we retrospectively reviewed 98 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients followed over a mean period of 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NPSLE was identified in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> were the most frequent NP manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NPSLE and non-NPSLE groups were similar with regard to demographic characteristics, ACR criteria, serum autoantibodies, and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of note, compared to the non-NPSLE group, NPSLE was associated with a higher frequency of smoking (78 versus 26%), organ damage (73 versus 34%), and cumulative mortality rate (14 versus 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The series of patients was further analysed according to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, the interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of NP disease and SLE diagnosis was shorter in the APS(-) (0.3 ± 1 years) than in the APS(+) (5 ± 7 years) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence and/or persistence of NP events were only documented in the APS(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall cumulative mortality was highest in NPSLE and in APS(+) patients with inadequate anticoagulation control, identifying an aspect that requires improved vigilance and the development of novel therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
