<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few patients with APS and previously positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) may become negative over time </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We described the follow-up of 11 primary APS patients whose aPL become persistently negative and in whom thromboprophylaxis was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was the recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with previous thrombotic event and a first thrombotic event in women with previous obstetric APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten (90 %) patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven (64 %) patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, two of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, and four (36 %) women had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new thrombotic episode was observed after a median follow-up period of 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation or antiaggregation could be discontinued in some peculiar patients with low-risk primary APS whose aPL become persistently negative </plain></SENT>
