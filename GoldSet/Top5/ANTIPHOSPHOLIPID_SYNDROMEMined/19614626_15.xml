<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) are at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e>, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, and pre-term labor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL target the placenta directly by binding to beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of aPL on trophoblast function and the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: First trimester trophoblast cells were treated with anti-beta(2)GPI monoclonal antibodies and patient-derived aPL, after which cell survival and function was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report that anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies trigger an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in trophoblast, characterized by increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-8, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, GRO-alpha, and IL-1beta, and that this occurs in a TLR-4/MyD88-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At high concentrations, these antibodies also induce caspase-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was attenuated upon disabling of the MyD88 pathway, suggesting that anti-beta(2)GPI-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> compromise trophoblast survival by acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enhanced IL-8, GRO-alpha, and IL-1beta secretion also occurred when trophoblast cells were incubated with antibodies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>, which acts as a pro-survival factor in human trophoblast, attenuated the anti-beta(2)GPI antibody-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and also the pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>, but only at high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that aPL triggers a placental <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> via the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway, which in turn compromises trophoblast survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway may provide a new therapeutic target to improve pregnancy outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
