<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among the diagnostic assays for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) is the strongest predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; however, it presents several limitations as interference with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and poor inter-laboratory agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of LA activity is apparently due to antibodies against prothrombin (PT), usually detectable by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Binding of PT to phosphatidylserine (PS) has been shown to enhance solid-phase anti-PT assay sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of antibodies against PS/PT (aPS/PT) in APS, we tested the semiquantitative QUANTA Lite(®) aPS/PT ELISA in a cohort of 80 APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aPS/PT was 81.3 %, rising to 87.6 % when considering LA-positive subjects only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a strong correlation between aPS/PT and LA (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To note, APS patients with thrombotic manifestations displayed significantly higher IgG aPS/PT titers compared to 20 aPL asymptomatic carriers (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To rule out a possible cross-reactivity of anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies (aβ2GPI) with PS/PT complex, we tested two monoclonal aβ2GPI antibodies and an affinity-purified (AP) polyclonal aβ2GPI IgG obtained from the serum of a patient reacting against both β2GPI and PS/PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two monoclonal antibodies did not show any reactivity against PS/PT complex, similarly the AP IgGs did not react toward PS/PT antigen while preserved their aβ2GPI activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that aPS/PT are a definite antibody population in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the good correlation between aPS/PT ELISA and LA may support its use as a surrogate test for LA, particularly useful to overcome the technical limitations of the functional assay </plain></SENT>
