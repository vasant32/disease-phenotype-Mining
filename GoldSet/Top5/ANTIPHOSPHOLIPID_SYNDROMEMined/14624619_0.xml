<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> was incorporated to reduce the rate of elimination of the conjugates from plasma and to putatively improve their efficacy as toleragens for the suppression of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three structurally distinct types of multivalent platforms were constructed by incorporating <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> into the platform structures in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> incorporated ranged from about 5000 g per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mole</z:e> to about 30000 g per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mole</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The platforms were functionalized with either four or eight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29770">aminooxy groups</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conjugates were prepared by forming <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> linkages between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29770">aminooxy groups</z:chebi> and N-terminally glyoxylated domain 1 polypeptide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma half-life of each conjugate, labeled with (125)I, was measured in both mice and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The half-lives of the conjugates ranged from less than 10 min to about 1 h in mice, and from less than 3 h to about 19 h in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of five tetravalent conjugates to suppress anti-domain 1 antibodies in immunized rats was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> in the conjugates significantly reduced the doses required for suppression, and the amount of reduction correlated with the amount of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> incorporated </plain></SENT>
