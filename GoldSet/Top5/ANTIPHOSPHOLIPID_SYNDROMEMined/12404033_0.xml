<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation that native PT shows conformational changes in presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ ions and discloses new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> available for binding with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, we performed 3 different methods for the detection of aPT in presence and absence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+, finding a different incidence of specific autoantibodies, associated with clinical features of APS (aPT in presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+) or non associated (aPT in absence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPT was significantly associated also with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection of aPT (in presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+) significantly enhances diagnostic sensibility of APS allowing the identification of a subset of patients (6/99) with clinical features of APS, but with negative LAC, aCL and a beta2-GPI; in fact (limited to thrombotic episodes) the sensibility rises from 56.2% with one test (LAC) to 81.1% with the application of LAC, aCL, a(beta)2GPI and aPT </plain></SENT>
