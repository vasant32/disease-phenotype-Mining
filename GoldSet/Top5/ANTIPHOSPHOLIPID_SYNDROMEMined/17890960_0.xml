<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic etiological factors are variable in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, including antibody-antigen complex-mediated platelet activation, inhibition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, or attenuation of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002563'>constrictive pericarditis</z:hpo> and hepatic enlargement that was found to have platelet-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and marked clot lysis via thrombelastography in the preoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Restoration of circulation following pericardectomy and inotropic support was associated with attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> and fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the etiological factors responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-mediated hemostatic abnormalities and the probable effects of hepatic hypoperfusion on clot lysis in this patient were detected with thrombelastography, and similar thrombelastographic analyses are recommended to compliment standard coagulation assessments of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
