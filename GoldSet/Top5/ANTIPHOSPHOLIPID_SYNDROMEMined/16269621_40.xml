<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we published the existence of 2 populations of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type A antibodies recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> G40-R43 in domain I of beta2-GPI and are strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type B antibodies recognize other parts of beta2-GPI and are not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we demonstrate that type A antibodies only recognize plasma-purified beta2-GPI when coated onto a negatively charged surface and not when coated onto a neutrally charged surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affinity of type B antibodies toward plasma-purified beta2-GPI was independent of the charge of the surface to which beta2-GPI was coated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type A antibodies did not recognize plasma-purified beta2-GPI in solution, whereas they did recognize recombinant beta2-GPI both in solution and coated onto a neutrally charged plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the carbohydrate chains were removed from plasma-purified beta2-GPI, we found that type A antibodies did recognize the protein in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that the difference in recognition of plasma-purified and recombinant beta2-GPI is caused by the difference in glycosylation and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> G40-R43 of plasma-purified beta2-GPI is covered by a carbohydrate chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type A anti-beta2-GPI antibodies can only recognize this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> when this carbohydrate chain is displaced as a result of a conformational change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding has major implications both for the detection of pathogenic anti-beta2-GPI antibodies and the comprehension of the pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
