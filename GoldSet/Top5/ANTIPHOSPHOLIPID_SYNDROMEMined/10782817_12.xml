<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare the clinical relevance of these antibodies to that of anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum IgG aPT, aANX, aCL, and anti-beta2-GPI levels were measured by solid phase enzyme immunoassay in the sera of 70 patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, 35 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and 35 without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records were analyzed, and associations of the antibodies with clinical features of APS were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with APS had higher frequency of aPT (p = 0.001) and aANX (p = 0.002) compared to patients without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events occurred more frequently in those with aPT or aANX than those without (p = 0.005, p = 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPT and aANX was found to be highly specific for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of aPT and aANX antibodies may be of value in confirming the diagnosis of APS, and in evaluating risk of venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
