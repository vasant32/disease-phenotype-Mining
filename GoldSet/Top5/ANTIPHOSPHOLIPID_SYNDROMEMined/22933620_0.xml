<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Complement activation plays a role in pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), but the involvement of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the effects of human polyclonal antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and tissue factor (TF) up-regulation in C6 deficient (C6(-/-)) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C6(-/-) mice or the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C3H/HeJ (C6(+/+)) mice were injected twice with IgG-APS (n = 2) or IgM-APS (n = 1) isolated from APS patients or with the corresponding control immunoglobulins (Igs) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum, (NHS) (IgG-NHS or IgM-NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, the sizes of induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the femoral vein were determined 72 hours after the first injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor was determined in homogenates of carotid arteries and in peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> sizes were significantly larger in C6(+/+) treated with IgG-APS1 or with IgG-APS2 or with IgM-APS when compared with C6(+/+) mice treated with IgG-NHS or with IgM-NHS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sizes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were significantly smaller in the C6(-/-) mice injected with IgG-APS1, IgG-APS2 or IgM-APS (p &lt; 0.001), compared to their C6(+/+) counterparts showing an important abrogation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in mice lacking C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TF expression and activity in the C6(-/-) mice treated with IgG-APS or IgM-APS were diminished when compared to C3H/HeJ (C6(+/+)) mice treated with the same Igs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mice injected with IgG-APS and IgM-APS had medium-high titers of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (aβ(2)GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the C6 component of the complement system mediates aPL-thrombogenic effects, underscoring an important pathogenic mechanism and indicating the possibility of inhibiting complement to ameliorate APS-related manifestations </plain></SENT>
