<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Specialist clinic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 90 women (median age 33 (range 22-43)) with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (median number 4 (range 3-15)) and persistently positive results for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Either low dose aspirin (75 mg daily) or low dose aspirin and 5000 U of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> subcutaneously 12 hourly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women started treatment with low dose aspirin when they had a positive urine pregnancy test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women were randomly allocated an intervention when fetal heart activity was seen on ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was stopped at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> or at 34 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of live births with the two treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the two groups in age or the number and gestation of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of live births with low dose aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was 71% (32/45 pregnancies) and 42% (19/45 pregnancies) with low dose aspirin alone (odds ratio 3.37 (95% confidence interval 1.40 to 8.10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> occurred in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in outcome between the two treatments in pregnancies that advanced beyond 13 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 51 successful pregnancies (24%) were delivered before 37 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Women randomly allocated aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> had a median decrease in lumbar spine bone density of 5.4% (range -8.6% to 1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> leads to a significantly higher rate of live births in women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies than that achieved with aspirin alone </plain></SENT>
