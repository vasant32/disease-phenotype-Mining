<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding of oxLDL to the macrophages was inhibited by the addition of polyinosinic acid (poly (I)), a competitor of the scavenger receptor, but not by another polyanionic acid, polycytidylic acid (poly (C)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the binding of oxLDL was significantly increased by the simultaneous addition of human beta 2-GPI and monoclonal aCL derived from NZW x BXSB F1 (WB F1) mice, an animal model of APS, or anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies from BALB/c mice immunized with human beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that beta 2-GPI may be an antiatherogenic protein and that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> against beta 2-GPI may have a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in APS </plain></SENT>
