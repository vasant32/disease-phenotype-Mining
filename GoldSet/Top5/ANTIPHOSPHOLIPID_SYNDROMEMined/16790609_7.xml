<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of complement is unclear in patients with unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e>, though low levels of complement 3 (C3) and/or complement 4 (C4) are reported to be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether C3 and C4 have a predictive value for subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 215 patients with a history of two consecutive first-trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and no abnormal chromosomes in either partner, no uterine anomalies and no antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood tests for C3, C4, total haemolytic complement (CH50), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were performed before subsequent pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were then followed up without treatment, and their pregnancy outcomes were compared with their previous blood test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 215 pregnant patients, 45 subsequently miscarried, whereas the remainder had a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no relation with serum CH50, IgG, IgA and IgM levels, but C3 and C4 levels in patients with subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> were significantly higher than in those whose pregnancy was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with two previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>, C3 and C4 levels were higher in those women who had a third <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, than in women that went on to have a live birth </plain></SENT>
