<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-beta2GPI antibodies were detected in patient sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA class II alleles (DRB1, DQB1) were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based DNA genotyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to native human beta2GPI were measured in a 7-day proliferation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified three groups of Caucasian SLE patients using these ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, 16 out of 18 SLE patients (89%) with anti-beta2GPI antibodies were positive for HLA-DRB1*0401/4/8, DR11 or DRB1*1302 (P=0.001 vs controls) compared with 23 out of 53 patients (43%) in group 2 with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies only, 57 out of 151 patients (38%) in group 3 (SLE patients without anticardiolipin antibodies) and 109 out of 225 controls (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with anti-beta2GPI antibodies had greater median stimulation indices to beta2GPI in vitro compared with the 15 controls studied (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The HLA class II and PBMC proliferation data suggest that beta2GPI may be both a T- and B-cell autoantigen in SLE </plain></SENT>
