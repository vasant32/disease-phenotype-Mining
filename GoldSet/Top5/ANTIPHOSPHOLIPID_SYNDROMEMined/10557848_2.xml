<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The data and the results obtained at the above symposium show that the flow cytometric method closely correlates with the standardized aCL bench ELISA and with the APhL ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aCL/aPS FACS kit is comparable in sensitivity to the APhL ELISA kit and standard aCL bench ELISA, but the aCL/aPS FACS kit is more specific than the standard anticardiolipin assay (particularly for the determination of aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In summary, the aCL/aPS FACS kit enables rapid (total run time &lt; or = 1 hr) and simultaneous determination of aCL (aCL) and anti-PS antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes and combines good sensitivity and specificity in a single assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method is reproducible (intraassay variations &lt; 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is easy to transform into a partially or fully mechanized process and is well suited for laboratories that test large numbers of samples daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay promises to be useful not only for detecting positive APS sera, but also in evaluating the significance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> specificity and antibody isotypes in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
