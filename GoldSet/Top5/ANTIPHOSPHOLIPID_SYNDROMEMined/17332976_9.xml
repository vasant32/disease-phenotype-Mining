<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present work was to evaluate the frequency of such antibodies in patients infected with HIV and study its association with the presence of clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a transversal study, a population of patients diagnosed with HIV, identified through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test and confirmed by Western blotting, aged above 17 years old, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through a standard questionnaire, the presence of APS manifestations was investigated, as well as the frequency of rheumatic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2 GPI) and anticardiolipin (aCL) IgA, IgG, and IgM were investigated by the ELISA method using commercial kits (QUANTA Lite, INOVA Diagnostics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety patients were studied, 47 (52.2%) male and 43 (47.8%) female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of APS were detected in 12 patients (13.3%) of the studied population, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> was the most common rheumatic manifestation (38.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 90 patients, 40 (44.4%) were reactive for at least one type of aPL antibody (aCL and/or anti-beta2 GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aCL was 17.8%, from which 15 (16.7%) had aCL IgG, 3 (3.3%) IgM, and 1 (1.1%) IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the anti-beta2 GPI antibody was 33.3%, from which 29 (32.2%) were positive for isotype IgA, 4 (4.4%) isotype IgM, and 1 (1.1%) isotype IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between immunoreactivity for aPL antibodies in general or each isotype in particular and the presence of APS manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the present study, it was possible to observe a relatively high frequency of aPL antibodies, particularly for isotype IgA anti-beta2 GPI in HIV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association to APS manifestations, suggesting that such antibodies had no etiopathogenic role in these complications in patients with such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
