<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: One hundred thirty-six women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, including 70 with histories for Obs-APS and 30 controls, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with Obs-APS showed resistance to AnxA5 activity (median, 216%; range, 130-282% vs controls; median, 247%; range, 217-283%; P &lt; .0001) and elevated levels of anti-domain I immunoglobulin (Ig) G (optical density: median, 0.056; range, 0.021-0.489 vs median, 0.042; range, 0.020-0.323; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those in the lowest tertile of AnxA5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> ratios had an odds ratio for Obs-APS of 58.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.3-1021.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between levels of annexin A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and anti-domain I IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Resistance to AnxA5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity is associated with antibody recognition of domain I of β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and identifies a subset of women with histories for Obs-APS </plain></SENT>
