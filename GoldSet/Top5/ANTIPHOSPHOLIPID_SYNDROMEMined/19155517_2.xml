<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that some human antiphospholipid Abs (aPL) in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) bind to the homologous enzymatic domains of thrombin and the activated coagulation factor X (FXa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some of the reactive Abs are prothrombotic and interfere with inactivation of thrombin and FXa by antithrombin (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering the enzymatic domain of activated coagulation factor IX (FIXa) is homologous to those of thrombin and FXa, we hypothesized that some aPLs in APS bind to FIXa and hinder AT inactivation of FIXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we searched for IgG anti-FIXa Abs in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once the concerned Abs were found, we studied the effects of the Ab on FIXa inactivation by AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 10 of 12 patient-derived monoclonal IgG aPLs bound to FIXa and that IgG anti-FIXa Abs in APS patients were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the mean + 3 SD of 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls as the cutoff, the IgG anti-FIXa Abs were present in 11 of 38 (28.9%) APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, 4 of 10 FIXa-reactive monoclonal aPLs (including the B2 mAb generated against beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I significantly hindered AT inactivation of FIXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, IgG from two positive plasma samples were found to interfere with AT inactivation of FIXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IgG anti-FIXa Ab occurred in approximately 30% of APS patients and could interfere with AT inactivation of FIXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because FIXa is an upstream procoagulant factor, impaired AT regulation of FIXa might contribute more toward <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than the dysregulation of the downstream FXa and thrombin </plain></SENT>
