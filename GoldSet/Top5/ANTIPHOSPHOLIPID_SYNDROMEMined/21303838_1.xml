<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following a systematic working algorithm, the Task Force identified five major issues that impede APS clinical research and the ability to develop evidence-based recommendations for the management of aPL-positive patients: (1) aPL detection has been based on partially or non-standardized tests, and clinical (and basic) APS research studies have included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> aPL profiles with different clinical event risks; (2) clinical (and basic) APS research studies have included a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients with different aPL-related manifestations (some controversial); (3) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or pregnancy risk stratification and quantification are rarely incorporated in APS clinical research; (4) most APS clinical studies include patients with single positive aPL results and/or low-titer aPL ELISA results; furthermore, study designs are mostly retrospective and not population based, with limited number of prospective and/or controlled population studies; and (5) lack of the understanding the particular mechanisms of aPL-mediated clinical events limits the optimal clinical study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Task Force recommended that there is an urgent need for a truly international collaborative approach to design and conduct well-designed prospective large-scale multi-center clinical trials of patients with persistent and clinically significant aPL profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An international collaborative meeting to formulate a good research question using 'FINER' (Feasible; Interesting; Novel; Ethical; and Relevant) criteria took place in November 2010 </plain></SENT>
