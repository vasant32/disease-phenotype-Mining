<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is characterized by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in patients with thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In APS, most aPL are autoantibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and prothrombin, which play a major role in the APS pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, antibodies with the same antigen specificity are also found in aPL patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>, in whom thromboembolic complications are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The in vivo upregulation of the tissue factor (TF) pathway and the imbalance of cytokines have been proposed as potential mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured the circulating levels of TF, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in 83 patients with autoimmune aPL (42 with and 41 without clinical features of definite primary APS), 48 leprosy patients (33 with aPL) and 48 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend (P = 0.06) to higher median sTF in patients with autoimmune aPL (139 pg/mL) compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients (103.5 pg/mL) and controls (123 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of raised sTF levels (&gt; 187 pg/mL) was significantly higher in the group with autoimmune aPL [22.9% (APS 21.4%, non-APS 24.4%)] but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> (10.4%) compared with controls (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and a trend to lower IFN-gamma were found in patients with definite APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Leprosy</z:e> patients with aPL, however, had increased TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of sIL-6R did not differ between controls and either patients with autoimmune aPL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The different cytokine profiles as well as differences in circulating levels of TF might contribute to the high thrombotic risk found in patients with autoimmune aPL but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> related aPL patients </plain></SENT>
