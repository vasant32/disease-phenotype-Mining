<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-LBPA anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies were determined using a "home made" ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) was assessed using a series of clotting tests in accordance with the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-LBPA was significantly prevalent in primary APS (p=0.000) with a sensitivity of 58.6% and a specificity of 92.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgM anti-LBPA showed a significant frequency in primary APS (p=0.000) with a sensitivity of 28.6% and a specificity of 97.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-LBPA's sensitivity and specificity for APS were lower or equal to those of aCL and anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-LBPA in the different clinical and laboratory subsets of APS was lower than those of aCL and anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to observe that both IgG and IgM anti-LBPA were never found alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The comparison between anti-LBPA and LA showed that the former had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in view of our results anti-LBPA cannot at present be considered a further tool to be utilized to diagnose APS and to differentiate the different clinical and laboratory subsets of this disease </plain></SENT>
