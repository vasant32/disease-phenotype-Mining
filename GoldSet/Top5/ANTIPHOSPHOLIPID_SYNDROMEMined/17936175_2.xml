<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>APS is recognized increasingly as a leading cause of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the obvious exception of pregnancy morbidity, most of the clinical features that may occur in adults with APS have been described also in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the coincident prothrombotic factors that are common in adults have little or no impact in children, pediatric patients with APS constitute a suitable sample to investigate the relationship of aPL with the associated clinical manifestations, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and the specificities of aPL that are more linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, because of the high frequency of infectious processes in early life, children may have a greater prevalence of nonpathogenic and transient aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to APS in childhood may be different from that for adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the rarity of aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in children, the natural history and optimal management can be defined only through large, multicenter, controlled studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A internet-based registry for pediatric patients with APS (Ped-APS Register) has been recently established as part of the activities of the Euro-aPL Forum and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Working Group of the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This registry is aimed to obtain information on APS in childhood, particularly regarding association of aPL with clinical manifestations, specificity of aPL, impact of treatment and long-term outcome (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/PEDIATRIC.HTM) </plain></SENT>
