<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>Disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) is an acquired syndrome characterised by formation of microthrombi and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> in the microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is characterised by multiorgan <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, mainly involving small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A broad spectrum of disorders may develop <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features; however, the catastrophic APS has not previously been recognised as a cause of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical and laboratory characteristics of catastrophic APS patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The web site based international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (CAPS registry) (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) was analysed and the cases with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 173 patients with catastrophic APS, 23 (13%) were found with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical and immunological characteristics were similar in catastrophic APS patients with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features; a significant difference was found only in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (100% in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features v 59% in those without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features are not rare in catastrophic APS, supporting the need for systematic screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features without precipitating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> features in the context of an APS makes it imperative to rule out the catastrophic variant of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
