<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2003, complement determinations (C3 and C4 levels, CH50 activity) were performed in 597 consecutive patients diagnosed with SLE (530 women and 67 men, mean age 32.6 years) and 70 with primary APS (57 women and 13 men, mean age 38.7) visited in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complement determinations are routinely made at the first visit of patients and yearly during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SLE and primary APS were diagnosed according to current classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypocomplementemia was detected in 371 (62%) of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> complement values, those with hypocomplementemia showed a higher prevalence of female gender (P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (P = 0.021), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.023), positive anti-dsDNA antibodies (P = 0.012) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with hypocomplementemia showed a higher prevalence of APS-related features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hypocomplementemia was prospectively related to accumulated hospitalization in SLE patients but not with the accumulated number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> flares or with the survival after follow-up of five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 33 (47%) patients with primary APS presented low complement values, which were associated with a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (P = 0.022), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.004), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (P = 0.013), positive IgM-aCL (P = 0.039), positive ANA (P = 0.002) and anti-dsDNA (P = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of hypocomplementemia in patients with SLE is based on the association with disease activity, immune-complex mediated manifestations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>) and APS-related features (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hypocomplementemia was found in nearly half of patients with primary APS, and was associated with some APS features (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, aPL) but also with SLE-related immunological markers (ANA and anti-dsDNA), identifying a subset of patients with primary APS with a higher risk of evolving to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results clearly support the routine determination of complement factors in the clinical follow-up of patients with SLE and primary APS </plain></SENT>
