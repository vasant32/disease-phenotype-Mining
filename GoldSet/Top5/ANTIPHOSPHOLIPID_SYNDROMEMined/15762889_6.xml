<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we first evaluated aLBPA in comparison with the most widely used methods (i.e. anticardiolipin [(aCL)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] and antibeta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies (abeta(2)-GPI-ELISA) utilized to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in patients with primary or secondary APS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then assessed the relationship between aLBPA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) and the main clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, we evaluated the presence of 'pure' (i.e. beta(2)-GPI-independent) aLBPA in patients with APS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that aLBPA as well as abeta(2)-GPI display higher specificity but lower sensitivity for APS compared to aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum aLBPA correlate closely with aCL and abeta(2)-GPI in APS patients and are strictly associated with LAC positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that beta(2)-GPI binds to LBPA with affinity similar to CL, and antibodies able to react with phosholipid-protein complex exist; however, 'pure' aLBPA can also be detected in sera of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether these data confirm that LBPA may be an antigenic target in APS and that aLBPA are serological markers of APS with similar sensitivity and specificity compared to abeta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical utility of aLBPA detection alone or in combination with aCL and/or abeta(2)-GPI remains to be elucidated in larger and longitudinal studies </plain></SENT>
