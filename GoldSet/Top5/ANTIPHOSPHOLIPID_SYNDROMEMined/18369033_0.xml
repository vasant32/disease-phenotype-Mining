<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal duration of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (OAT) after VTE is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients can be stratified into risk categories for recurrence on the basis of clinical characteristics of the index VTE event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with VTE due to a transient risk factor are at a low risk of recurrence and short term anticoagulation is indicated (3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with an idiopathic event or with known thrombophilic defects are candidates to a longer OAT course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> syndrome, recurrent idiopathic event, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, homozygosity or double heterozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin mutation are candidates for extended long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recently, studies have indicated that other factors such as D-Dimer levels after the discontinuation of OAT or the residual vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be additional predictive factors for recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recent Italian collaborative, prospective, randomized PROLONG study showed that patients with a previous idiopathic VTE, treated for at least 3 months, who have abnormal D-dimer assay tested one month after OAT withdrawal have a significant incidence of recurrent VTE which is reduced by resumption of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the optimal course of anticoagulation in subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer, whose risk of VTE recurrence is markedly lower, is not clearly established yet </plain></SENT>
