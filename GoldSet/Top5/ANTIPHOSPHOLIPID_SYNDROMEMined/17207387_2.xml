<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of aRib-P Ab and their correlation with clinical manifestations and anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE patients from Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elevated titers of aRib-P Ab utilizing the ELISA method were analyzed in 141 sera samples from 44 SLE patients, 20 Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) patients, 22 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) patients, 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and 43 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SLEDAI score was utilized for assessing SLE disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated titers of aRib-P Ab were present in 11% of SLE patients (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean SLEDAI was 7 (range: 3-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant association was observed between the presence of aRib-P Ab and disease manifestations present in the SLEDAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 6 SLE patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (n = 3), and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> (n = 1) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies were found in 50% of patients with elevated titers of aRib- P Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAPS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or healthy controls did not harbor elevated titers of aRib-P Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated titers of aRib-P Ab were restricted to SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We confirm previously reported associations of aRib-P Ab reactivity with disease activity and elevated anti-dsDNA Ab titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation with a specific manifestation described on the SLEDAI score was established in this small cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
