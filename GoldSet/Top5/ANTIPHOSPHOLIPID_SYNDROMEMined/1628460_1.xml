<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> with the persistence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000603'>central scotoma</z:hpo> in a 26-year-old woman who was proven to have biologic false positive test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, and the elevated serum titres of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C.S.F. findings showed the absence of oligoclonal bands and the presence of IgM anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was treated twice at intervals of two weeks with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> 1000 mg intravenously daily for three days (pulse therapy), and was started on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 60 mg daily which tapered gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the second treatment of the pulse therapy, her visual acuity was improved remarkably and the titre of anticardiolipin antibodies became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her clinical course seemed to be different from that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, in which many of patients recover near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual acuity after a first attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> might play a role in the etiology of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
