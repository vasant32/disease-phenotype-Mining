<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 23 patients with confirmed diagnosis of APS were retrospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were receiving LMWH as a result of intolerance and/or lack of response to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type of LMWH, the duration of treatment, the reason for switching to LMWH and the adverse effects were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were classified as no improvement, partial improvement or total improvement after at least 1 year of using LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average duration of LMWH treatment was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were on treatment with enoxaparin (n=16, 69%) and were switched to LMWH from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> mainly because of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> despite therapeutic international normalised ratio (n=9, 39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good quality of life with no evidence of recurrent thrombotic events was noted in nine patients (39%), whereas 11 (48%) showed partial clinical improvement but no evidence of recurrent thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>Osteoporosis</z:hpo> was reported in five patients (23%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were also receiving treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term LMWH may be a safe and effective alternative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for APS patients </plain></SENT>
