<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This dilemma is mainly due to only a cross-sectional analysis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> pictorial description in previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment strategy is unknown in this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We encountered a patient who exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> had an increase of blood anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody and anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her neurological deficits did not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy but rapidly subsided after plasmapheresis associated with a normalization of APAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, a causal relation between APAbs and non-vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> is favored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of APAb-related non-vascular neurotoxicity is warranted for further study to avoid premature conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasmapheresis is recommended when <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> responds poorly to conventional treatment, especially when APAb is found </plain></SENT>
