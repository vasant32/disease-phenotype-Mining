<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined prospectively the prevalence of anti-(apoA-1) IgG in patients with ACS (n=127), APE (n=58) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=34), and, when present, we tested their association with oxLDL levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalance of anti-(apoA-1) IgG was 11% in the ACS group, 2% in the control group and 0% in the APE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ACS group had significantly higher median anti-(apoA-1) IgG titres than the other groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with ACS positive for anti-(apoA-1) IgG had significantly higher median oxLDL values than those who tested negative (226.5 compared with 47.7 units/l; P&lt;0.00001) and controls </plain></SENT>
