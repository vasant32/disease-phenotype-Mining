<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and D-Dimer (D-D) were taken as markers of thrombin generation and fibrin turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean F1 + 2 levels were higher in thrombotic (p = 0.006) and non-thrombotic subjects (p = 0.0001) than in controls as were those of D-D (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.003 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TAT levels did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower mean levels of f-PS were found in thrombotic (p = 0.0006) and non-thrombotic subjects (p = 0.002) than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within both groups, mean F1 + 2 levels were higher in subjects who had low f-PS levels compared to those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> f-PS levels (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gender analysed data revealed blunted tPA release (venous occlusion test) in thrombotic females (from 16.80 +/- 0.79 to 21.3 +/- 3.9 ng/nl, NS) but not in thrombotic males (from 18.2 +/- 2.0 to 33.7 +/- 4.9 ng/ml, p=0.01) nor in asymptomatic subjects of either sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, in both patient groups females had higher mean PAI than males (p &lt; 0.0002) and than control females (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low free protein S was found in 100% of non-thrombotic and in 90% of thrombotic patients with defective fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with increased thrombin generation, accelerated fibrin turnover and fibrinolysis abnormalities also in asymptomatic carriers of aPLs and highlight a central role for acquired f-PS deficiency in the thrombotic tendency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
