<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet agent because it is safe, efficient, and inexpensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a significant subset of patients does not exhibit a full inhibition of platelet aggregation, termed 'aspirin resistance' (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several major studies have observed that AR patients have a 4-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and other thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-stimulated whole blood aggregation was tested in 132 adults at risk for ischemic events, and identified an inadequate response to aspirin therapy in 9 patients (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression profiling of blood <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> by microarray was used to generate new hypotheses about the etiology of AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the differentially expressed genes, there were decreases in several known platelet transcripts, including clusterin (CLU), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa (ITGA2B/3), lipocalin (LCN2), lactoferrin (LTF), and the thrombopoetin receptor (MPL), but with increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for the T-cell Th1 chemokine CXCL10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a strong association of AR with expression of HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DQA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar HLA changes have been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), in which autoantibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>/protein complexes can trigger platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with APS, AR patients exhibited a 30% reduction in platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up testing for autoimmune antibodies observed only borderline titers in AR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results suggest that AR may be related to changes in platelet gene expression creating a hyperreactive platelet, despite antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies will focus on determining the protein levels of these differential transcripts in platelets, and the possible involvement of HLA restriction as a contributing factor </plain></SENT>
