<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the antiphospholipid profile and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and neonatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively considered 109 treated pregnancies of 93 patients with primary APS and reviewed the medical records of their 111 infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neonatal outcome was assessed using the following variables: weeks of gestational age at delivery, percentiles of birth weight, Apgar score at 5 minutes, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room, time in the neonatal intensive care unit, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and other neonatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between APS maternal features and neonatal outcome parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When maternal APS features and variables of infant outcome were analyzed, it was evident that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), triple antiphospholipid positivity, and history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were significantly associated with some parameters of a poor infant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>History of pregnancy morbidity alone was, instead, significantly correlated to the variables of favorable neonatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There seems to be more than one kind of pregnant woman with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even when treated with a second-line therapy plan, mothers with LAC and/or triple antiphospholipid positivity and/or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> seem to have a high probability of poor neonatal outcome, whereas those with pregnancy morbidity alone, treated with conventional drugs, seem to have a high probability of favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
