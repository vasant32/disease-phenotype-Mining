<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Delineation of mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (NPSLE) and determination of biological markers could guide treatment choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to analyse the potential role of activated CD8+ T cells in NPSLE as previously reported in SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes was performed in 30 patients with NPSLE and 36 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antigenic specificity of CD8+ T cells was studied using HLA-A0201 tetramers loaded with several myelin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracellular level of interferon γ (IFNγ) produced by activated CD8+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A large increase in circulating activated CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing surface HLA-DR was found in patients with NPSLE without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (n=18) compared with patients with APS (n=12) or healthy controls (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFNγ-secreting myelin-specific CD8+ T cells were detected exclusively in the blood of patients with NPSLE without APS but with white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support the existence of a new immune effector mechanism responsible for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in patients with NPSLE and suggest that analysing HLA-DR expression combined with myelin-specific tetramer staining on CD8+ T lymphocytes may be a valuable additional tool for the monitoring of these patients </plain></SENT>
