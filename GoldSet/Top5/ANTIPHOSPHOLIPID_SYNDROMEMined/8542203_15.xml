<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether beta 2GPI changes were associated with the thromboembolic complications of aPAs, we measured beta 2GPI antigen (beta 2GPI:Ag), beta 2GPI aPA cofactor activity (beta 2GPI:Cof) and antibodies to beta 2GPI (alpha beta 2GPI) in 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients, of whom 19 had evidence of aPAs (SLE-aPA+) and 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PaPS). beta 2GPI:Ag levels were significantly increased in SLE-aPA+ patients and PaPS patients compared with SLE-aPA- patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of beta 2GPI:Cof/Ag was significantly reduced in SLE-aPA+ patients compared with SLE-aPA- patients, indicating functional modification of beta 2GPI in SLE-aPA+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty per cent of patients with anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG also had alpha beta 2GPI, and 13% patients with no detectable aCL IgG had alpha beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased beta 2GPI:Ag and alpha beta 2GPI were associated with a clinical history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of these investigations suggest that beta 2GPI may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with aPAs </plain></SENT>
