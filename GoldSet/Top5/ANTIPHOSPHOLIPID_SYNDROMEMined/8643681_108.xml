<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since PtdSer is a potent surface procoagulant, and since there is an increased incidence of coagulation events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who have anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, we addressed whether apoptotic cells are procoagulant and whether anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies influence this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic HeLa cells, human endothelial cells, and a murine pre-B-cell line were markedly procoagulant in a modified Russell viper venom assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procoagulant effect was entirely abolished by addition of the PtdSer-binding protein, annexin V, confirming that it was PtdSer-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procoagulant effect was also abolished by addition of IgG purified from the plasma of three patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome, but not IgG from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy of apoptotic cells stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein-isothiocyanate</z:chebi>-conjugated-annexin V demonstrated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>)-dependent binding to the surface of membrane <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> o apoptotic cells, but not to intracellular membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that the surface <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> of apoptotic cells constitute an important immunogenic particle in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that the PtdSer exposed on the outside of these <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> can induce the production of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, which might also enhance the immunogenicity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> occurs in a microenvironment in direct contact with circulating plasma, the unique procoagulant consequences of the apoptotic surface may additionally be expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This might explain the increased incidence of pathological intravascular coagulation events that occur in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients who have anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
