<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the thrombogenic effect of murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is due to their aPL or their anti-beta2GP1 activity, we injected mice with murine monoclonal anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2GP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effects of these antibodies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, was evaluated utilizing a mouse model which enables kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in animals injected with murine aCL antibodies was larger than that in control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> kinetics between anti-beta2GP1 injected mice and controls, suggesting that the thrombogenic effect of aPL antibodies is not related to their anti-beta2GP1 activity alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice receiving monoclonal antibodies with both aCL and anti-beta2GP1 activity, also increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that murine aCL, but not anti-beta2GP1, antibodies are thrombogenic in vivo </plain></SENT>
