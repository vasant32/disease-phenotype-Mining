<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and to examine whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is associated with diastolic dysfunction independently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> and systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pulsed, continuous, colour Doppler echocardiography was performed in 179 subjects, of whom 15 were excluded from the analysis because of systolic dysfunction or severe valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 164 subjects included 29 patients with primary APS, 26 patients with secondary APS (APS in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)), and 30 patients with SLE and aCL but without APS; 43 patients with SLE without aCL and 36 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers served as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The groups compared differed significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures of right ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a gradation of increasing diastolic function impairment as manifested by prolonged deceleration time (DT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) across the groups of patients with SLE without aCL, SLE with aCL, secondary APS, and primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in left ventricular diastolic function measures were less prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In regression analysis, DT increased by 19.6 ms (p=0.002) in the presence of primary APS and by 20.1 ms (p=0.038) in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The titre of IgG aCL was the strongest predictor of a prolonged IVRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diastolic dysfunction, in particular of the right ventricle-that is, independent of valvular disease and systolic dysfunction, is a prominent feature of APS and may be related to the pathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
