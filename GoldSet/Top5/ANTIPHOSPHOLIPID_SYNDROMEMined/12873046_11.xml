<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The features of unselected patients with primary APS who had disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before the age of 16 years were retrospectively analysed in three Italian referralcentres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory manifestations were assessed to establish whether, at the end of follow-up, the final diagnosis was still primary APS or whether they had developed definite SLE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients, nine boys and five girls, who had the presenting clinical manifestation of APS between three and 13 years of age (median nine years) and were followed for two to 16 years (median six years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, five with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, two with peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and onewith <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, four patients had one or more recurrences of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At last observation, 10 patients could still be classified as having primary APS, two had developed SLE, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> and one Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion; our analysis suggests that some children who present with the features of primary APS may progress to develop SLE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
