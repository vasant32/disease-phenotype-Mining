<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that, while almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the sera from APS patients, positive for IgG aCL and anti-β2-GPI by ELISA, were also positive for IgG aCl by chemiluminescence, only 30.13% of patients without clinical manifestations of APS, but positive for aCL and persistently negative for anti-β2-GPI (by ELISA) and LA, confirmed the positive test by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This difference was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this test also prompted to identify 20% of patients positive for LA, but persistently negative for both aCL and anti-β2-GPI IgG (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the new technology of automated chemiluminescence assay for measuring aPL may represent an useful tool to identify "true" APS patients </plain></SENT>
