<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is recommended for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, but <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related outcomes have not been systematically investigated when <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy is managed by a dedicated anticoagulation clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the study were to evaluate <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related monitoring outcomes, clinical endpoints and the use of healthcare resources as a result of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related complications in patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> compared to a group of patients without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were managed in an anticoagulation clinic setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective observational cohort design was used to investigate patients with and without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had a history of venous or arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and were matched for age, gender and indication for oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were compared to a matched cohort of 36 patients without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monitoring outcomes (time in therapeutic range, clinic visits per year, frequency of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> dosing adjustments, reasons for out-of-range INRs) were similar between groups, as was the frequency of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications (3.2%/pt-yr vs. 3.1%/pt-yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (9.6%/pt-yr vs 0) occurred more frequently in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> patients required more emergency room visits (6.4%/pt-yr vs. 1.6%/pt-yr) and hospital admissions (14.4%/pt-yr vs.3.0%/pt-yr) to manage complications of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, despite similar monitoring outcomes obtained in a dedicated anticoagulation clinic setting, adverse clinical outcomes are significantly more frequent in patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome than in those without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, and require more frequent use of healthcare resources </plain></SENT>
