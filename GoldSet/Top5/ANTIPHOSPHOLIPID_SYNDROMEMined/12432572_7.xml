<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since part of these anti-idiotypes may bear an internal image of the eliciting antigen, IVIG might be suitable for induction of oral tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we attempted to induce tolerance in an experimental model of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) by oral administration of IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Naive mice were fed with IVIG, or anti-beta 2GPI-specific anti-idiotypic IVIG(alpha Id) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly diminished humoral response was noted in mice IVIG/ IVIG-F(ab')(2)or IVIG(alpha Id)-tolerized mice, accompanied by a significant attenuation of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal effect was achieved in the mice tolerized before disease induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abrogation of T lymphocyte proliferation to beta 2GPI was detected in the mice fed with IVIG prior to beta 2GPI immunization, mediated by TGFbeta and IL-10 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tolerance induced by IVIG-feeding was nonspecific and could be adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice by CD8alpha (+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These CD8alpha (+) T cells, were found to secrete high levels of TGFbeta and IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, IVIG-induced oral tolerance has a nonspecific immunomodulatory effect in experimental APS, mediated by TGFbeta and IL-10-secreting CD8alpha (+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results point to a possible application of IVIG in the induction of oral tolerance against various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
