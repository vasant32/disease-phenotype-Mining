<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this coexistence is fortuitous or not is still a mater of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is well admitted that (i) thrombotic events occurring in FVII-deficient patients with any apparent triggering factors are very rare, (ii) surgical procedures, replacement therapy (especially containing activated factors) but also the presence of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are frequently associated with these particular thrombotic events, (iii) in the same way, R304Q and A294V FVII variants appear to be more prevalent than other FVII equally frequent mutations and finally (iv) low FVII coagulant activity levels do not protect against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, peri-operative thrombotic prophylaxis should be relevant for these particular FVII-deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, safety, treatment modalities and specific indications of such an antithrombotic prophylaxis remain to be established </plain></SENT>
