<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Innovations in interventional therapy and better understanding of underlying diseases have improved therapy strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the analysis of patient and disease characteristics, outcome, and specific complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between September 1988 and December 2006 we performed 42 orthotopic liver transplantations (OLTs) in 39 patients with BCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 (74%) women and 10 men (26%) had a median age of 35 years; the median follow-up period was 96 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Etiologically, 27 patients had a preoperative diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.4% and 83.5%, respectively, compared to 80.7% and 71.4%, respectively, for other indications (n = 1742) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retransplantation was necessary in 3 patients (7.1%) with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent BCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events was similar, incidence of vascular complications was significantly higher in patients with BCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the portal vein was observed in 4.8% versus 0.8% of the patients, whereas liver veins were affected in 7.1% versus 0.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data shows that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> forms of BCS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> can be successfully treated by OLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite higher rates of vascular complications, patient and graft survival are similar or even better compared to other indication groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with reversible hepatic damage should be treated by combined strategies, including medical therapy and surgical or interventional shunting </plain></SENT>
