<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, evaluated 46 patients with refractory SLE treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for a history of APS prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SLE-related APS in our patient population was 61% (28 of 46 patients with refractory SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 28 patients with APS had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) or high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLAs), either immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM, when evaluated at study entry </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 22 patients refractory to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> anticoagulation discontinued anticoagulation therapy a median of 4 months after transplantation; 78% of them remained free of thrombotic events and in complete SLE remission for up to 78 months (median, 15 months) after HSCT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autologous HSCT may be performed safely in patients with APS and appears to be effective therapy for eliminating ALPAs and preventing thrombotic complications in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
