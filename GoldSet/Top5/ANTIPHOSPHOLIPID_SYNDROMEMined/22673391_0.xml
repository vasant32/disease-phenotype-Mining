<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of APS is based on the Sydney classification criteria (2006), in which positive laboratory tests (anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-Î²2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) are mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not uncommon to see patients with clinical features highly suggestive of the syndrome in whom these antibodies are persistently negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we summarise the principal clinical and serological findings in a subgroup of patients with seronegative APS in the first series published up to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a recent study draws attention to the safety and efficacy of the long-term use of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> in patients with APS not susceptible to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is also a subgroup of women with APS and recurrent foetal loss with no response to the standard antithrombotic therapy; in this group the materno-foetal prognosis could be improved by the addition of low-dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> during the first trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we list the principal recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in APS drawn from the expert consensus document elaborated at the meeting held in Galvestone (2010) </plain></SENT>
