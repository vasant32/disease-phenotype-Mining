<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To explore whether endothelial function is related to bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive adult SLE patients and age-, sex-, BMI- and smoking-status-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e>, dysthyroidism, history of or treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or bone loss were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was assessed by measuring flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) at the brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lumbar and hip BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting blood samples were assayed for atherogenic index and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression models were constructed to study the relationship between FMD and BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ten subjects (55 SLE and 55 matched healthy controls) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While there were no differences between SLE patients and controls in menopausal status, blood pressure, atherogenic index, carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and BMD, SLE patients had significantly poorer FMD even after adjustment for age, gender, smoking and baseline brachial artery diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, SLE patients with lumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> had significantly lower FMD than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression revealed that lower FMD was associated with lower lumbar BMD and higher serum hsCRP in SLE patients, but these relationships were absent amongst healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar vertebral BMD predicted endothelial reactivity in SLE patients without clinically-overt bone loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, early atherosclerotic disease should be considered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients especially if vertebral bone loss is evident </plain></SENT>
