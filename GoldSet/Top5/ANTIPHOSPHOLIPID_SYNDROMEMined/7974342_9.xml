<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every month, a daily infusion of 400 mg immunoglobulins per kg body weight was given during five consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's pregnancy ended preterm with a live birth, delivered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011410'>caesarian section</z:hpo> because of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 1070 g (P20-P25) weighing girl was in good health, apart from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, due to dysfunction of the atrioventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each treatment with IVIg resulted in a slight reduction of both anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> levels and in an increase in platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the six-month observation period, a gradual decline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and an increase in platelet count was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The potential role of anti-idiotypic antibodies, present in the IVIg used for treatment, was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IVIg were able to reduce the binding of the patient's anticardiolipin antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> coated microtiter plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies in IVIg was further documented by affinity chromatography and by realtime biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) on a BIA-core instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anticardiolipin antibodies were retarded on a column of insolubilized IVIg and a weak interaction was found between IVIg and affinity purified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, coupled to the BIA-core biosensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the same technology revealed increased levels of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the patient's plasma following IVIg therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
