<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and examined the correlations between these antibodies and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included thirty-two patients with clinically definite MS, thirteen patients with other autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e> (disease control A), eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular diseases</z:e> (disease control B) and twenty-six healthy persons (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MS group IgG antibody against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) was detected in 3 (9%); among them, cofactor (beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I) dependency was shown in 2 but one was cofactor independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgM antibody was elevated in 14 of 32 patients (44%) with MS, but cofactor dependency was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this was significantly higher in frequency than that of the disease control A (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of antibodies against phosphatidylserine were found similar to CL, but antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> were in most cases negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each of anti-CL IgG antibody purified from four patients with diverse immunological disorders (primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, MS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) had different reactivities against DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the aPL positive group in MS possessed the autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody at higher rate than the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, clinically two groups of MS were indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher incidence of aPL may imply that a broad spectrum of autoantibodies might be produced in MS; some antibodies presumably related directly to MS pathogenesis are yet to be identified </plain></SENT>
