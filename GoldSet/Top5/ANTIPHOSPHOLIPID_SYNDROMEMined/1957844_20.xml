<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies and correlation with pregnancy outcome in 1449 pregnant women </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persistence of positive anticardiolipin antibody tests was also ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 1449 sera (1.79%) were immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin positive, and 63 (4.3%) were immunoglobulin M anticardiolipin positive </plain></SENT>
