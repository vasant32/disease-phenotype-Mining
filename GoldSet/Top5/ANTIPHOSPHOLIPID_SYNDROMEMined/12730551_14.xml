<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One suggested mechanism may be the action of autoantibodies directed against plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the presence and patterns of cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (Apo A-I) in patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 50 patients (25 SLE and 25 APS) and 10 healthy controls together with three human immunoglobulin G anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) monoclonal antibodies (IS4, CL1 and CL24) were assessed for the presence of autoantibodies binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and Apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classical inhibition assays were performed to study interference by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and Apo A-I in the binding of the human monoclonal antibody to CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the cross-reactivity patterns between these autoantibodies, sera from 12 patients were incubated on ELISA plates coated with the three different molecules and the captured antibodies were then tested for their activity towards each of the other antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three monoclonals bound to CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IS4 and CL1 also bound to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> but only IS4 bound to Apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> titres were higher in patients with APS than SLE and in healthy controls (P&lt;0.03 and P&lt;0.009 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Titres of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were higher in patients with SLE and APS than in controls (P&lt;0.009 and P&lt;0.03 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences with respect to the presence of antibodies binding to Apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the SLE population, anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> antibody titres correlated with anti-Apo A-I (r=0.563, P&lt;0.004), but not in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the cross-reactive assay, 11/12 (91.7%) of the samples containing isolated anti-CL antibodies reacted to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and 2/12 (16.7%) to Apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Samples containing isolated anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> antibodies also reacted with CL and Apo A-I (7/12 and 3/12 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples collected after incubation with Apo A-I bound to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and 6/12 (50%) to CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the cross-reactivity patterns between patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE and APS have antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and Apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A high percentage of these antibodies cross-react with CL, suggesting the presence of different groups of antibodies with different targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The study of the interaction between the immune response and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> components and the correct characterization of the reactivity patterns of autoantibodies may be of relevance in the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
