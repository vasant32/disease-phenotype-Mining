<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Modern ultrasound (US) equipment allows rheumatologists to directly visualize hand and finger arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>How does US aid in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> (RP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Color Doppler US of the proper and common palmar digital, radial, and ulnar arteries and the superficial palmar arch of both hands was performed in 135 consecutive patients who presented with suspected RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: US was pathologic in 63% of patients with secondary RP, in 6% with primary RP, and in none with pseudo-RP (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 3 types of vascular pathology: Type 1 showed narrowing or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion of some proper digital arteries; Type 2 was characterized by the same finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> proper digital arteries; and Type 3 involved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type 1 was found in 3 of 53 patients with primary RP and in 19 patients with secondary RP including 5 of 9 patients with anti-centromere positive systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc); Type 2 occurred in 16 patients with SSc, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e>; and Type 3 was found in 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thromboangiitis obliterans</z:e>, vibration trauma, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ulnar arteries were more commonly affected than the radial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2nd radial, 3rd radial, 4th ulnar, and 5th ulnar proper palmar digital arteries were most commonly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aiding in differentiating primary versus secondary RP, severe versus less severe disease, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, digital artery US depicts the same anatomical structures as angiography, but it is cheaper, faster, and noninvasive </plain></SENT>
