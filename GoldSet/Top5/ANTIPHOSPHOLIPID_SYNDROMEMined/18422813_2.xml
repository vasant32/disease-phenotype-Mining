<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: We studied explants from 6- to 10-week-old placentas that had been prepared by collagenase digestion from 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> from APS-positive patients, nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> in patients positive for FV Leiden mutation, and 10 induced abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of Fas and FasL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis showed that placental FasL expression was significantly lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0009661'>abnormal pregnancies</z:mp> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no such difference was observed for Fas expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FasL on placental cells may be involved in the maintenance of immune privilege, thereby ensuring the safety and growth of placental tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of apoptotic mechanisms may play a critical role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
