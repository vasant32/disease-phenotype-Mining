<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the antiphospholipid serology of 123 patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) attending our hematology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cohort was tested for anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) antibodies and aCL of IgG and IgM class and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six of these patients fulfilled Sapporo clinical criteria for APS and 70 of these patients had venous and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with LA plus anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies had significantly higher levels of IgG aCL and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies than those exhibiting positivity for only LA or anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with aCL IgG levels over 60 GPLU were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to be positive for LA and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies; 25.2% (31/123) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 26.04% (25/96) of patients fulfilling Sapporo clinical criteria for APS were positive for aCL only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean IgG aCL level in the Sapporo clinical criteria positive patients who had aCL only was 11.5 GPLU (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> &lt; 5 GPLU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that omission of aCL testing from the clinical investigation of APS could lead to a failure to diagnose the syndrome in a proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
