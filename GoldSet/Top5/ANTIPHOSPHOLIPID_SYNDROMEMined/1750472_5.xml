<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that platelet-activating factor, an autacoid synthesized by vascular endothelium, might mediate this phenomenon through its ability to promote platelet aggregation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> might exert a procoagulant effect by inhibiting the synthesis of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate these theories, endothelial cells (harvested from human umbilical veins) were grown to confluence and incubated for 48 hours with 20% concentrations of anticardiolipin antibody-positive and -negative human sera as well as fetal bovine serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After incubation culture wells were stimulated with 10 mumol/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 (an <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of platelet-activating factor and prostacyclin synthesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular platelet-activating factor was measured by tritiated <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> incorporation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> extraction, thin-layer chromatography, and scintillation spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced platelet-activating factor synthesis was identified in cultures incubated with anticardiolipin antibody-positive serum (25,544 +/- 2604 disintegrations per minute, mean +/- SD) when compared with anticardiolipin antibody-negative serum (18,600 +/- 3316 dpm) or fetal bovine serum (19,014 +/- 4233 dpm; analysis of variance, p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In similar experiments, prostacyclin synthesis was determined by measuring its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35220">primary metabolite</z:chebi>, 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi>, in culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences between anticardiolipin antibody-positive and control cultures were observed (analysis of variance, p = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in this endothelial cell model, anticardiolipin antibody-positive serum enhances <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>-mediated platelet-activating factor synthesis but has no apparent effect on the production of prostacyclin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential role for platelet-activating factor in anticardiolipin antibody-mediated vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
