<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction of beta(2)-GPI with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> is intriguing in the context of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To extend understanding of the binding mechanism to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, the interactions of beta(2)-GPI with amphiphiles, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium lauryl sulfate</z:chebi> and lysophospholipids, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These amphiphiles induced the aggregation of beta(2)-GPI below the critical micelle concentration, indicating that the interaction of beta(2)-GPI with monodispersed amphiphiles is unstable, resulting in the formation of large aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, highly soluble monocaproylphosphatidic acid did not induce aggregation, suggesting that the hydrophobicity of the acyl chain is also an important factor for aggregate formation in addition to negative charges in the headgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of experiments using deletion mutants and a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> showed that the fifth domain of beta(2)-GPI (domain V) is responsible for formation of aggregates observed for intact full-length beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the flexible loop (F307-C326) in the C-terminal of domain V, which consists of hydrophobic and positively charged residues, was identified as the important region for aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that beta(2)-GPI binds to the amphiphiles through the flexible loop of domain V, resulting in formation of large aggregates where both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are involved </plain></SENT>
