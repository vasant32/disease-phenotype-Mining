<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In early infancy, virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children initiate transient immune response to non-pathogenic nutritional antigens, which fails to terminate in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the possibility that a prolonged immune response to beta(2)GPI could also spread to the human protein, antibodies against human beta(2)GPI (anti-beta(2)GPI) were determined in 93 randomly selected children with different allergic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high frequency (42%) of IgG anti-beta(2)GPI was found in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> (AD), but not in those with other allergic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD were exclusively of the IgG1 subclass and bound to bovine beta(2)GPI as well, but not to either beta(2)GPI combined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were identified in domain V of beta(2)GPI and the antibody binding was abolished upon the specific proteolytic cleavage of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding C-terminal loop in domain V of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD most likely resided in close vicinity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The epitopic difference from anti-beta(2)GPI in APS may explain presumed non-thrombogenicity of anti-beta(2)GPI in children with AD </plain></SENT>
