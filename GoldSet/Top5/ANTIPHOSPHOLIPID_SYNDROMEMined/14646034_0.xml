<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of false positive results in the anticardiolipin (aCL) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) hampers its application in identifying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), a condition characterized by a myriad of clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study highlights some of the pitfalls in the use of assays for antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aCL ELISA, commercially prepared anti-beta2-gylcoprotein 1 (beta2-GP1) and antiphospholipid (APhL) assays were evaluated in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in 94 pregnant women who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and a group of 177 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serological tests were used to rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> as the cause of false positive results in the aCL ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of positive aCL ELISA results (29/94, 31% v 26/177, 14%; p = 0.001) and aCL antibodies of the IgM isotype (19/94, 20% v 6/177, 3%; $p = 0.001$) were significantly higher in aborters compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the sera which were positive in the aCL ELISA were shown to be false positives as 93% (27/29) of aCL positive aborters and 67% (8/24) of aCL positive healthy subjects were negative in the anti-beta2-GP1 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the sensitivity of the APhL ELISA was low and only 1% (1/94) of the sera of aborters and 6% (11/177) of healthy subjects were positive in this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of anticardiolipin antibodies of the authentic non-autoimmune variety and the low sensitivity of the other more specific aPL assays make the positive aCL ELISA difficult to interpret </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the diagnosis APS be made with strict adherence to the preliminary criteria for classification of APS </plain></SENT>
