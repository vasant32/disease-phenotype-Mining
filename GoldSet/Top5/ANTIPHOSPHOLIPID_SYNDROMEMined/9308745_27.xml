<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) includes antibodies primarily directed against various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins, mainly beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies suggest that there is an association between the presence of anti beta2GPI antibodies (alphabeta2GPI) of IgG isotype and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aPL defined according to the plasma protein to which they are directed appear to be more appropriate for the evaluation of their clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using home-made ELISAs we evaluated the presence of alphabeta2GPI and antiprothrombin antibodies (anti-II) of both isotypes (IgG and IgM) in a group of 233 patients with LA and/or aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four women had a history of pregnancy loss, 45 patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) and 32 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients from the autoimmune group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) had a higher prevalence of alphabeta2GPI and/or anti-II than those from the miscellaneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, a significant association was shown between the presence of alphabeta2GPI-IgG (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and previous VT, but not AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-II were related to VT but the multivariate analysis showed that alphabeta2GPI-IgG are the only independent risk factor for VT (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.3-6.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of alphabeta2GPI-IgM correlates well with a history of pregnancy loss (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The coagulation tests profile showed that the clotting assays were more prolonged in patients having aCL, alphabeta2GPI or anti-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But a higher prevalence of abnormal results was only found for the dilute Russell viper venom time in patients with VT, as compared to those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (94.4% vs. 58.7%, p &lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The measurement of alphabeta2GPI of both isotypes could help to identify aPL-positive patients with a higher risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy loss, although this association should be confirmed by prospective studies </plain></SENT>
