<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine SLE patients (12 SLE-aPLS) and 23 control subjects were studied using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>N-Acetylaspartate/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>/Cre (Cho/Cre) were measured in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and elevated IgG-aPL were more common in SLE-aPLS patients than in SLE patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre was lower (P&lt;0.05) and Cho/Cre higher (P&lt;0.001) in SLE-aPLS patients than in SLE patients without aPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression models showed <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre was most related to injury seen by imaging (P&lt;0.01), disease duration (P&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>05), and prior neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre was more closely related to IgG-aPL (P&lt;0.01) than the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or aPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> factors, Cho/Cre was most associated with the presence of aPLS (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SLE and SLE-aPLS are actually a clinical continuum describing brain injury in SLE, with SLE-aPLS being characterized by increased aPL, NPSLE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and disturbed neurochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An elevated IgG-aPL level is a potent risk factor for brain injury as measured by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cre in SLE that is independent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and aPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, thrombotic phenomena and the presence of aPL (aPLS) are most closely associated with increased Cho/Cre in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aPLs exacerbate SLE, resulting in increased thrombotic and nonthrombotic brain injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spectroscopy detects brain injury in SLE and may permit better understanding of the neurological consequences of SLE and SLE-aPLS </plain></SENT>
