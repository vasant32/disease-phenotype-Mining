<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To define the specificity and positive predictive value of anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-beta(2)GP1) antibodies for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the presence of anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-beta(2)GP1) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM in 191 consecutive sera from 191 patients and reviewed clinical data separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL IgG and IgM were detected separately using commercial ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies were detected with an in-house ELISA using beta(2)GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients were diagnosed as having APS and 184 as having other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients were aCL-positive and 12 were anti-beta(2)GP1-positive, seven of these 12 were APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificity for anti-beta(2)GP1 in our population was 97%, with a positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the aCL-positive patients, specificity was 90% and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 70-87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies have a higher specificity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> than aCL for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of anti-beta(2)GP1 was greater in aCL-positive than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that screening for anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies in aCL-positive patients increases the specificity and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of aCL testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that there is no need to screen for anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies in the absence of aCL antibodies and in the absence of strong clinical suspicion of APS </plain></SENT>
