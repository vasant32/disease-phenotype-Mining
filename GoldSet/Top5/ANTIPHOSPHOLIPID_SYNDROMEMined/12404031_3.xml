<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2000 cells at serum dilution of 1:40 was used to examine 26 sera which had previously showed a "mitotic spindle" fluoroscopic pattern type during laboratory routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21 sera (80,7%) were identified with NuMA and 5 (19,3%) with HsEg5 patterns alone or associated with other ANA patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However only patients with isolated positivity and that is 15 with NuMA and 4 with HsEg5 stainings were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the NuMA positive patients 5 were affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo> associated to different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>, 2 with seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086981" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sicca syndrome</z:e>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e>, 1 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and 1 with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the HsEg5 positive patients 3 were affected with SLE and 1 with seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NuMA does not prevail in any defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, while HsEg5 staining were more frequent (75%) in patients affected with SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom showing high antibody titres </plain></SENT>
