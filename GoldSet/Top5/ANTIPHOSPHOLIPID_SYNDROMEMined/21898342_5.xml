<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The presence of autoantibodies against a cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> in domain I of β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2)GPI) is strongly associated with thrombotic events in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a conformational change could be a trigger for the formation of antibodies against domain I of β(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether immune responses against β(2)GPI are related to its conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conformational changes in β(2)GPI were studied using various techniques, either upon binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or after disruption of the internal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunogenicity of β(2)GPI in different conformations as well as the individual domains of β(2)GPI were studied in vivo by monitoring the generation of antibodies after intravenous administration of β(2)GPI to mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, plasma samples from these mice were assessed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed that the interaction of β(2)GPI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> induced a conformational change in β(2)GPI: electron microscopy revealed that β(2)GPI assembled into polymeric meshworks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We next investigated the immunogenicity of both human and murine β(2)GPI in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both human and murine β(2)GPI combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and misfolded β(2)GPI triggered antibody formation against the native protein as well as against domain I of β(2)GPI, while native β(2)GPI was not immunogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that anti-domain I antibodies developed in mice injected with domain I of β(2)GPI, and that antibodies did not develop in mice injected with domains II-V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The induced anti-domain I antibodies prolonged the dilute Russell's viper venom plasma clotting time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma of mice with anti-domain I antibodies had increased levels of circulating thrombin-antithrombin complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our studies indicate that the exposure of cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> due to conformational changes in β(2)GPI can induce autoantibody formation </plain></SENT>
