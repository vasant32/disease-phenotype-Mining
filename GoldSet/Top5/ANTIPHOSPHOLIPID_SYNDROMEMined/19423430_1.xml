<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have applied a novel statistical technique for gene selection based on machine learning approaches to analyze microarray expression data gathered from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> of unknown genetic origin that share many common features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The methodology included a combination of three data discretization policies, a consensus gene selection method, and a multivariate correlation measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A set of 150 genes was found to discriminate SLE and PAPS patients from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical validations demonstrate the relevance of this gene set from an univariate and multivariate perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, functional characterization of these genes identified an interferon-regulated gene signature, consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also revealed the existence of other regulatory pathways, including those regulated by PTEN, TNF, and BCL-2, which are altered in SLE and PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, a significant number of these genes carry E2F binding motifs in their promoters, projecting a role for E2F in the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
