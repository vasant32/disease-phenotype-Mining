<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether active immunisation of mice with pathogenic anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM), derived from the serum of a patient with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, could dysregulate the idiotypic cascade and induce the production of anti-anti-anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (Ab3) with anticardiolipin activity by the mice with the association of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anticardiolipin antibodies were purified from the serum of a patient with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purified anticardiolipin antibodies were used to immunise mice at the footpads and the mice were then followed up for serological and clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IgG anticardiolipin antibody was found to be monospecific and to bind <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> with high affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunisation of naive BALB/c mice with the purified IgG anticardiolipin antibody was followed by production in the mice of sustained high titres of IgG anticardiolipin antibody, associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (64.5 (9.7) v 30.1 (1.7) seconds in control mice) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (0.4 (0.06) x 10(9) v 1.0 (0.09) x 10(9)/l platelets in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The titres of other autoantibodies (for example, antibodies to DNA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>), though high after the immunisation, decreased rapidly and were almost undetected one month after the boost injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mice immunised with the IgG anticardiolipin antibody showed low fecundity (36% of mice became pregnant v 62% in the group immunised with control IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pregnant mice had an increased resorption rate (the equivalent of fetal loss in the human) of 61 (9)% v 5 (4)% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) embryo and placental weights in mice with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were significantly lower than in the mice injected with control IgG (641 (210) and 103 (14) mg v 1303 (105) and 145 (8) mg respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IgM anticardiolipin antibodies purified from the same patient were found to be polyspecific, binding with low affinity to anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi>, and carried the anti-DNA idiotype 16/6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice immunised with the purified IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, though showing reduced fecundity (30%), had only a slightly increased resorption rate (12 (9) v 3 (5)% in controls) and only a slight and statistically non-significant decrease in mean (SD) embryo and placental weights (1134 (188) and 136 (11) mg respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the induction of pathogenic anticardiolipin antibodies by immunisation with serum anticardiolipin, dysregulating the idiotypic network, and point to the higher pathogenic potential of serum IgG v IgM anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
