<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with primary APS and refractory recurrent episodes of DAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted 15 times due to recurrent episodes of DAH in a period of 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple immunosuppressive drugs did not improve his condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two years after his presentation, he was treated with rituximab (two doses of 1 g, 2 weeks apart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months later, the attacks of DAH have gradually disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up of more than 2 years after he received rituximab, the patient has had no further admissions due to DAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were measured during follow-up of 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG titer decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 6 months after therapy but anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody titer increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that rituximab caused a dramatic clinical response in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-β2 glycoprotein IgG correlated better with the clinical response in this patient than aCL </plain></SENT>
