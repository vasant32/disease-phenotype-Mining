<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-APS thrombotic patients (n = 100; 47 female, 53 male; mean age, 40 +/- 10 years) and healthy subjects (n = 100; 46 female, 54 male; mean age, 56 +/- 16 years) served as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (HC) (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aPL patients and in 51 subjects from the healthy control group (mean age, 38 +/- 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous prothrombin PT G20210A was more frequent in the thrombotic group without APS (18%) than in the control (4%), APS (12%) or aPL (11%) groups, whereas homozygous MTHFR C677 &lt;-- T was equally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After genotype sub-grouping, plasma HC was higher in APS patients with homozygous MTHFR C677 &lt;-- T compared with non-homozygous APS patients (22 +/- 5.4 versus 11 +/- 1.3 micromol/l; P &lt; 0.01) and with homozygous MTHFR C677 &lt;-- T controls (22 +/- 5.4 versus 15 +/- 2.0 micromol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the APS group, mean age at first event was lower in homozygous MTHFR C677 &lt;-- T patients than in non-homozygous patients (26 +/- 7.5 versus 36 +/- 13 years; P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same group, homozygous MTHFR C677 &lt;-- T patients suffered an increased average number of events per person than non-homozygous patients (1.9 versus 1.3; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous PT G20210A contributes little to the thrombotic tendency of primary APS whereas plasma HC may influence age at first event and number of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of plasma HC in aPL subjects may identify patients at increased thrombotic risk requiring HC lowering </plain></SENT>
