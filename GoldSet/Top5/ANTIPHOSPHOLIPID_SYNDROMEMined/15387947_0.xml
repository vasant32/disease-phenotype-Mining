<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 61 patients with defined APS admitted from Jan 1986 to Dec 2002 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 10 patients with primary APS and 51 patients with secondary APS were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women were affected 3.1 times as that of men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>48 of the 51 (94.1%) patients with secondary APS were complicated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, including 33 cases (64.7%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was presented in around 80.3% of the patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> frequently involved the gastrointestinal system (21 cases, 22.6%), pulmonary system (19 cases, 20.4%), the cerebral vascular system (17 cases, 18.3%), lower limb deep venous system (16 cases, 17.2%), and infrequently coronary arteries or adrenal glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0009661'>abnormal pregnancy</z:mp> rate in the 37 married women was 45.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anticardiolipin antibody (ACL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) was 77.0% and 62.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LA was associated with ACL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS occurs most commonly among young women, is a disorder characterized by recurrent venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or fetal losses associated with positive ACL or LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> frequently occurs in gastrointestinal system, pulmonary system, cerebral vascular system and deep venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association between clinical features of APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> is significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LA is a stronger risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009661'>abnormal pregnancy</z:mp> than ACL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet with low-dosage aspirin and long-term anticoagulation are main therapeutics </plain></SENT>
