<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) commonly affects the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system through mechanisms that may include small vessel pathology and activation of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) activate endothelial cells but the specific activation of brain vascular endothelial cells (BVEC) and the receptors and signaling pathways involved have not been fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether aPL, the inflammatory stimulant lipopolysacharide (LPS) and thrombin activate BVECs through a Ras-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rat BVEC (G8) were grown to confluence on 24-well plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG was purified from 8 APS patients on a protein G column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of ERK in the BVEC was measured by immunoblot utilizing a specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant phosphorylation of ERK was measured following exposure of the cells to LPS and thrombin and this was blocked by the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylate (FTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>aPL IgG (1:100 relative to serum) from 7/8 patients also induced phosphorylation of ERK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the Ras-ERK pathway is an effect of both APS IgG and thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pathway is potentially amenable to drugs such as FTS and may serve as a therapeutic target in APS </plain></SENT>
