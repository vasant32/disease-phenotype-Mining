<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic clinical complications and recurrent fetal loss associated with autoimmune antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are thought to be related to their binding to Beta(2)GPI-PL complex and interference with the physiological function of Beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of aPL on beta(2)GPI-PL interaction, we studied the binding of biotinylated Beta(2)GPI to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the presence and absence of purified aPL immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adding five different aPL IgG antibodies with different levels of aPL activity isolated from the sera of five patients with aPL-associated recurrent fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> greatly increased the binding of biotinylated beta(2)GPI to CL-coated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optical densities (ODs) were 0.635, 0.890, and 1.265 in the presence of three aPL IgG antibodies, compared to 0.425 in the absence of aPL IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human IgG had no enhancing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OD was 0.480 and 0.425, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of beta(2)GPI binding to CL by aPL IgG correlated with the titers of aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of phosphate-buffered saline with increasing salt concentrations as a washing buffer for the ELISA resulted in more stable binding of beta(2)GPI to PL in the presence of aPL IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the binding of autoimmune aPL antibodies to beta(2)GPI-PL complex results in abnormally tighter interaction between beta(2)GPI and PLs, which may lead to physiological dysfunction of beta(2)GPI as a regulator of coagulation </plain></SENT>
