<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of 92 consecutive unselected patients with SLE were prospectively studied over two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL, aPA, aPI and aPS were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aCL were detected in 34 (37%) patients, aPA in 26 (28%), aPI in 22 (24%), and aPS in 29 (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between the appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the presence of IgG aCL (p &lt; 0.001) and IgG aPS (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association was also found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and the presence of IgG aCL (p &lt; 0.001), IgG aPA (p &lt; 0.01), IgG aPI (p &lt; 0.05), and IgG aPS (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> was associated with the detection of IgM aCL (p &lt; 0.001), IgM aPA (p &lt; 0.05), IgM aPI (p &lt; 0.001), and IgM aPS (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found a relatively high prevalence of aCL, aPA, aPI and aPS in our SLE population and confirmed the presence of a correlation between the IgG isotype of these antibodies and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and also between the IgM isotype and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> that can be detected in SLE patients, as well as their association with the clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
