<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is now clear that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependence of some LA is related to the presence of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma protein beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI) and that autoantibodies to beta 2-GPI might represent a specific category of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To verify this hypothesis we have purified IgG autoantibodies to beta 2-GPI from plasma of 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, by means of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi>-immobilized human beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 preparations tested positive in anti-beta 2-GPI IgG antibody ELISA and showed a marked LA activity by prolonging dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT) from a minimum of 5.3 s in patient # 1 to a maximum of 41.1 s in patient # 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These IgG preparations behaved as typical LA, with this activity tending to disappear in the presence of increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the LA activity of the IgG preparations was not detectable in the absence of PL, in which case the ratio between dRVVT obtained in the presence and absence of IgG autoantibodies to beta 2-GPI was close to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pattern was confirmed by using plasma from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome testing positive for anti-beta 2-GPI IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that dRVVT performed both in the presence and absence of PL might constitute a sensitive screening test to detect specific antibodies with LA activity </plain></SENT>
