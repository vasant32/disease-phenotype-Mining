<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The SA1 and 16/6 idiotypes can be found in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of these idiotypes in a large cohort of SLE patients, and to determine whether their presence is correlated with the anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-dsDNA antibodies or with the clinical manifestations of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 492 SLE patients were evaluated for clinical manifestations of SLE and were assigned a disease severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ds-DNA autoantibodies, aCL autoantibodies of the IgM, IgG and IgA isotypes, and SA1 and 16/6 idiotypes were also determined in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of the SA1 and 16/6 idiotypes in the 492 SLE patients was found to be 11% and 5.1%, respectively, and these idiotypes were significantly more prevalent in the patients who had aCL antibodies of either the IgG, IgM or IgA isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, while the 16/6 idiotype was not associated with the clinical manifestation of either SLE or APS, the SA1 idiotype was found significantly more frequently in patients who had vascular events <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.016, 0.01, 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SLE patients with the SA1 idiotype may run a higher risk of developing vascular events, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These clinical manifestations can be attributed to both SLE and secondary APS when aCL autoantibodies are also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the possible pathogenicity of certain idiotypes in SLE cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
