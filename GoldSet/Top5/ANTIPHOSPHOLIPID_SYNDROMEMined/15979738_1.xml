<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of anticardiolipin antibodies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 patients, who were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">American Trypanosomiasis</z:e>) antibodies and had elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, were investigated in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the patients were male and 21 female with ages ranging from 60 to 81 years and with a mean age of 68.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three female and 11 male individuals from a senior citizen support group who were apparently healthy formed a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their ages varied from 62 to 80 years with a mean of 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies was performed by means of enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) for quantitative measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipins</z:chebi> in serum and evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> was confirmed by the Machado Guerreiro test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was made using Fisher's exact test with a confidence interval of 95% and a p-value &lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 48.8% of the patients and in 26.4% of the control group giving a p-value &lt;0.038 using the Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e> antibodies and anticardiolipin antibodies was evidenced in this series of patients </plain></SENT>
