<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: both groups were similar in age (mean 41 vs. 50 years), NYHA class at diagnosis (81 vs. 100% in III-IV) and the presence of previous or coexistent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in other territories (31 vs. 27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty three percent of patients in group A and 55% of patients in group B underwent thromboendarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed during an average of 45 months (0.5-144) </plain></SENT>
