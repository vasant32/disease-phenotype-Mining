<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detected anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 42 FDRs, aged 12.4 +/- 4.2 years and in 52 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL (IgG and IgM) were measured by ELISA and their results expressed in arbitrary units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FDRs underwent islet cell antibodies (ICA) measurement, intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA typing and HLA-DQ molecular analysis were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive levels of aCL-IgG were observed in 8/42 FDRs and no control subject (p = 0.04); aCL-IgM values were similar in FDRs and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between aCL levels and chronologic age or HbA1c levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between aCL frequency and immunologic (ICA), metabolic or genetic (HLA) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No FDR showed any feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aCL-IgG presence in FDRs is suggestive of a need to carry out a follow-up study to establish the significance of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
