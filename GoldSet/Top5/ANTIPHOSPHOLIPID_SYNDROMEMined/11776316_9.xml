<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are routinely performed on microtitre plates coated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that contact between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and NUNC-Immuno plates leads to extensive oxidation, generating a series of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29369">peroxy</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipins</z:chebi> which were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the impact of oxidation on the antibody assay. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was resolved into 12 molecular species, including oxidized species and non-oxidized species with different degrees of unsaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 species reacted under anaerobic conditions with serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immune reactivity was similar for tetralinoleoyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, trilinoleoyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, and peroxycardiolipins, but somewhat lower for tristearoyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25667">oleoyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oxidative treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> with air, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, or Cu2+/tert-butylhydroperoxide, either before or during the assay, did not enhance immune reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained with a monoclonal IgM from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-prone mice, that binds <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the absence of protein cofactors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the solid-phase assay for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can be supported by various oxidized and non-oxididized molecular species of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
