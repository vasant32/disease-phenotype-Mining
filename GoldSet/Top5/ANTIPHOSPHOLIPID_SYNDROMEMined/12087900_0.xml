<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum levels of sP-selectine, sE-selectine, sVCAM-1 were determined with enzyme immunoassay (R&amp;D, USA) in 23 SLE with APS, 15 SLE patients free of APS and 19 patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean levels of sE-selectine and sVCAM-1 in SLE patients with APS, PAPS and SLE was higher than in donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated mean levels of sP-selectine were observed only in SLE patients free of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients also showed a correlation between sVCAM-1 level and the disease activity (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of immunopathological process in APS is associated with increased concentration of sCMA </plain></SENT>
