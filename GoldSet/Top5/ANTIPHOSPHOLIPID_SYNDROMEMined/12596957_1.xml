<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detection of anticardiolipin antibodies in a group of 26 patients defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual aborters</z:e> (at least three consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>), and in a control group of 26 patients each of whom had had at least one live birth without pregnancy wastage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high level of anticardiolipin antibody activity was detected among 19.23% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual aborters</z:e> but in none of the controls, indicating an association between anticardiolipin antibody level and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
