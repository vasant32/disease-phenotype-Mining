<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently an experimental model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) was established in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this model, mice are immunized passively or actively with anticardiolipin antibodies and acquire the syndrome, which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (APTT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, low fecundity rate, and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> process of pregnancy, lymphokines affect fetal implantation and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokines from the colony stimulating factor family, like GM-CSF and IL-3, were shown to be positive signals for implantation and to promote placental development and fetal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given our preliminary findings of low IL-3 in mice with APLS and the efficacy of IL-3 in preventing fetal loss in a strain of mice prone to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e>, our aim in the present study was to examine the effect of murine recombinant IL-3 (mrIL-3) on pregnant mice induced with experimental APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice were passively transfused to the tail vein, 24 h following mating, with anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mice were divided into two groups: one group was injected intraperitoneally with mrIL-3 on days 6.5, 8.5, and 10.5 after mating, while the control group was injected with PBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the mice were killed on day 15 of pregnancy a 32% +/- 4.2 resorption rate was observed in the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-immunized group, which was reduced to 4% +/- 0.3 following treatment with mrIL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with the experimental APLS was also corrected following lymphokine administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-3 may be effective in prevention of recurrent fetal loss in APLS </plain></SENT>
