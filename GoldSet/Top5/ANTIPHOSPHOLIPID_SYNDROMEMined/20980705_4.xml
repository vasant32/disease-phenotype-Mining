<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> characterised by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, obstetric complications and the presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies such as anti-β2GPI-Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies may set off the coagulation cascade via several mechanisms, including the induction of tissue factor (TF) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> has recently emerged as an immunomodulator that might exert an anti-thrombotic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels in a cohort of APS patients, as well as the effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> in an in vitro model of APS-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were measured in 179 European APS patients and 141 healthy controls using the LIAISON chemiluminescent immunoassay, and the levels were evaluated in conjunction with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an vitro model, anti-β2GPI antibodies were purified from four patients with APS to evaluate the expression of TF in activated starved human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 10 nm) on anti-β2GPI-Abs mediated TF expression was analysed by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>Vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> (serum level ≤15 ng/ml) was documented in 49.5% of our APS patients versus 30% of controls (p&lt;0.001) and was significantly correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (58% vs 42%; p&lt;0.05), neurological and ophthalmic manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001209'>skin ulcerations</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> inhibited the expression of TF induced by anti-β2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>Vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> is common among APS patients and is associated with clinically defined thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> inhibits anti-β2GPI-mediated TF expression in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> might be associated with decreased inhibition of TF expression and increased coagulation in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> status and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation in APS patients should be considered </plain></SENT>
