<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the β(2)GPI Val/Leu(247) polymorphism and susceptibility to APS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and positivity for anti-β(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1507 patients with APS and 1450 controls in 12 comparative studies were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the β(2)GPI Val/Leu(247) polymorphism showed significant associations between the β(2)GPI Val allele and APS, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and anti-β(2)GPI positivity (odds ratio (OR) 1.316, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.068-1.621, p = 0.010; OR 1.908, 95% CI 1.195-3.046, p = 0.007; OR 1.630, 95% CI 1.018-2.609, p = 0.042, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A direct comparison between anti-β(2)GPI-positive and -negative patients revealed that the frequency of the Val allele was significantly higher in anti-β(2)GPI-positive patents (OR 1.514, 95% CI 1.017-1.253, p = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a direct comparison between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-positive and -negative patients also indicated that the Val/Val + Val/Leu and the Val/Val vs. Leu/Leu genotypes of the β(2)GPI polymorphism were significantly elevated in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR 2.817, 95% CI 1.200-6.610, p = 0.017; OR 3.312, 95% CI 1.338-8.200, p = 0.010, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that the β(2)GPI Val/Leu(247) polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to APS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and with anti-β(2)GPI positivity </plain></SENT>
