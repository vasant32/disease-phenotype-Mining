<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent features of APS were <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (51%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (46.8%), and neuropsychiatric disorders (40.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features were predominantly associated with elevated concentrations of IgG aCL isotype or with the presence of both IgG and IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders included mainly cerebrovascular ischemic disease (63%), but also some other, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and, rarely, atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events in APS are the most significant for therapeutic and prognostic considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment of basic disease (SLE) and conventional management of thromboembolic manifestation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and/or dicoumarol (or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) prevented neither the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in 9 patients (37.5%), nor the fatal outcome in 6 patients (12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigations and perhaps more aggressive approach to APS treatment are needed for better clinical care of these patients </plain></SENT>
