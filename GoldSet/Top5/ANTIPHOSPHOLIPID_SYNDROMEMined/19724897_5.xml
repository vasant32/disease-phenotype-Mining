<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggests that autoantibodies directly contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One proposed mechanism is the antibody-induced expression of tissue factor (TF) by blood monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annexin A2 (ANX2), a mediator of cell surface-specific plasmin generation, was identified to mediate endothelial cell activation by anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta 2 GPI) antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our previous study suggested that ANX2 was also involved in anti-beta 2 GPI/beta 2 GPI-induced TF expression on monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study, it was further demonstrated that beta 2 GPI interacts with ANX2 not only in a cell-dependent form but also in a cell-free system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further confirm the effects of ANX2 on anti-beta 2 GPI/beta 2 GPI-induced TF expression, an ANX2 cDNA-containing vector was transfected into HEK 293T cells which had originally little ANX2, then cells were treated by anti-beta 2 GPI/beta 2 GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that transfected HEK 293T cells could express more TF both at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels than that of no-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the TF expression was dramatically decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells in which the ANX2 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results indicate that ANX2 on cell surface functions as a mediator boosting TF expression on monocytes induced by anti-beta 2 GPI/beta 2 GPI complex, which is contributed to the thrombotic events in APS </plain></SENT>
