<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the effect of human monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) on platelet interaction with the subendothelium under flow conditions is dependent on beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three monoclonal IgM aCL with anti-beta(2)GPI activity (TM1B3, GR1D5, and EY2C9) obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, a monoclonal aCL with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity but without anti-beta(2)GPI activity (FRO) obtained from a patient with a splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and a control monoclonal IgM without aCL activity were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TM1B3, GR1D5, EY2C9, FRO, and control IgM (30 microg/ml) were added to reconstituted blood containing gel-filtered platelets (200 x 10(9)/liter), factor VIII (100 units/dl), and fibrinogen (1.5 gm/liter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were perfused (wall-shear rate 800 seconds(-1)), with and without the addition of purified beta(2)GPI (20 microg/ml), through annular chambers containing collagen-rich denuded vascular segments, and the percentages of surface covered by platelets and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in the percentages of surface covered by platelets and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed among samples with TM1B3, GR1D5, EY2C9, FRO, and control IgM added when reconstituted blood samples without beta(2)GPI were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a significant increase in the percentage of surface covered by platelets was observed in the presence of TM1B3, GR1D5, and EY2C9 but not in the presence of FRO when samples containing beta(2)GPI were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> formation was induced by TM1B3 and GR1D5 but not by EY2C9 or FRO in samples with added beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monoclonal aCL require anti-beta(2)GPI activity to promote platelet interaction with the subendothelium under flow conditions </plain></SENT>
