<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to neoepitopes of plasminogen and its activator (tissue-type plasminogen activator, t-PA) was explored in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA, n = 30), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (n = 20), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS, n = 23), and idiopathic arterial (n = 33) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera diluted 1/50 were incubated with either plasminogen or t-PA bound to their natural receptors (immobilized fibrin or monocytic cells), and bound immunoglobulins were detected using a sheep peroxidase labeled anti-human Fab IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls included plates coated with fibrin or cells alone or plasminogen passively adsorbed to the plastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera were considered positive when the absorbance at 405/490 nm was above the mean + 2 SD of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reactivity of sera against plasminogen bound to cells (28%) or to fibrin (22%) was a predominant feature in patients with RA compared with other patient groups and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, some patients with primary APS had reactivity against cell and fibrin bound plasminogen (9 and 13%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies against fibrin bound t-PA were detected in only 8% of patients with arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conformational changes induced by molecular assembly of plasminogen on cell or fibrin surfaces result in the expression of neoepitopes recognized by autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These autoantibodies could be markers of the proteolytic events associated with plasminogen activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
