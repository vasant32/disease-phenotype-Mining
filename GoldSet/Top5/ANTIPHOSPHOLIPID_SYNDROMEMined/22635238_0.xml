<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to evaluate the reference range upper limits (99th percentile) used for aCL and a-β2GPI in the northwest of Italy and to investigate the analytical performances of these assays with the newly obtained reference ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assayed aCL and a-β2GPI in 104 serum samples from patients without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pregnancy morbidity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (30 males and 74 non-pregnant females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the commercial assays available in our regions (i.e. Orgentec Diagnostika, Aesku Diagnostics and Inova Diagnostics ELISA; CliA Zenit-RA and EliA Phadia Laboratory Systems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A further 30 serum samples, including 10 from healthy subjects, 10 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients and 10 from septic patients were assessed to investigate the analytical performance of the obtained cut-off limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reference range upper limits obtained with the commercial kits differ among assays and from the values reported by the manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference ranges calculated for IgG and IgM aCL differed from the arbitrary selected laboratory classification values suggested in the guidelines of 40 GPL and MPL </plain></SENT>
