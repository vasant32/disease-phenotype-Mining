<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association between immunoglobulin A <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and pregnancy loss is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined whether immunoglobulin A <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, specifically anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and anticardiolipin, are associated with the obstetric features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Sera from 4 groups of women were studied: (1) 133 women who experienced unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo>, (2) 48 women who experienced unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, (3) 145 healthy fertile control subjects, and (4) 67 women with well-characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and anticardiolipin antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Groups of women who experienced unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> had a higher proportion of women who had positive test results for immunoglobulin A anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies than fertile control subjects (P &lt; .01, chi-square test); these subjects also had higher levels of autoantibody (P = .001, Kruskal-Wallis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women who experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> had a higher proportion of women with positive test results for immunoglobulin A anticardiolipin antibodies compared to fertile control subjects (P &lt; .05, chi-square test); this group also had higher levels of autoantibody (P = .0065, Kruskal-Wallis test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analysis showed significant correlation between anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I immunoglobulin A and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I immunoglobulin G (R = .609; P =.0001) and less correlation between anticardiolipin immunoglobulin A and anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G (R = .093; P = .065) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immunoglobulin A anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies are more common in women who experience unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> whose initial test results are negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies compared to fertile control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these antibodies may identify additional women with clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> who are not identified through traditional testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether these antibodies are directly pathogenic, a result of the pregnancy losses, or markers for an underlying, yet uncharacterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
