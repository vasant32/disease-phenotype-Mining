<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that a large proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> have low free protein S levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that protein S (PS) activity levels, as well as PS antigen (Ag), were significantly lower in 35 HIV-1 infected patients than in the control population (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When we divided HIV infected patients into three groups according to their CD4+ counts, we found that PS levels were significantly lower in patients with &lt; 100 CD4+ cells/ul </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the possible role of (auto)immune response in the pathogenesis of PS deficiency, the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or of the specific antibodies to protein S was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence (77.1%) of aCL in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The screening for specific anti-PS antibodies, performed by immunoblotting, showed an overall positivity of 28.6% in anti-HIV+ patients, with a higher prevalence in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the prevalence of the positivity for anti-PS antibodies was found to be higher in anti-HIV+ patients with PS levels &lt; 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken collectively, our findings suggest that at least one of the mechanisms through which PS levels are decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, is due to the presence of specific autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
