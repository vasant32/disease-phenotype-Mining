<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The issue of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as evaluated by measuring carotid intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), associated with aPL, has been limitedly explored in PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In an age- and sex-matched case-double-control study, intima media thickeness of carotid arteries was measured using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound in 49 thrombotic PAPS patients (18 M, 31 F, mean age 37+/-11), in 49 patients who suffered <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and 49 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was always greater in PAPS than control patients (common carotid P=0.004, bifurcation P=0.013, internal carotid P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By dividing participants into age tertiles most of the difference was explained by greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of PAPS patients in the second (common carotid P=0.003, bifurcation P=0.023, internal carotid P=0.003) and third tertiles (common carotid P=0.03, bifurcation P=0.004, internal carotid P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004416'>Premature atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a clinical feature of our thrombotic PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
