<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We assessed whether antibodies against platelet activating factor (PAF) are related to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) clinical manifestations, in particular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-PAF, anticardiolipin (aCL), antibeta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (antibeta2GPI) and antiphosphatidylcholine (anti-PC) antibodies were determined in 52 patients with APS, 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) aCL but without APS, 30 patients with SLE without aCL, and 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for determining anti-PAF antibodies in a bovine serum-free fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ELISA showed high specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homologous inhibition experiments showed 60-70% inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-PAF antibodies were found in 18/52 APS patients, 10/29 SLE/aCL+ patients, 9/30 SLE/aCL- patients and 3/30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-PAF antibodies were significantly associated with anti-PC antibodies (odds ratio [OR] 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>7, P &lt; 0.01), and there was a modest association with immunoglobulin G (IgG) aCL (OR 3.1, P &gt; 0.10), but not with IgM aCL or antibeta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three SLE/aCL+ patients and five SLE/aCL- patients had clinical manifestations characteristic of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients had anti-PAF antibodies, while none had high titres of aCL or antibeta2GPI antibodies and only one had anti-PC antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the combined APS and SLE groups, the presence of anti-PAF antibodies was significantly associated with clinical manifestations which are characteristic of APS (OR 2.6, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect was independent of IgG aCL and antibeta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PAF antibodies are common in APS and SLE and comprise an independent factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Several patients experiencing thromboses have anti-PAF antibodies without other antiphospholipid specificities </plain></SENT>
