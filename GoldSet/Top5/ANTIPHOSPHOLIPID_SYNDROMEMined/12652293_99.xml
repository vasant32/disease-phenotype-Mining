<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Tissue factor (TF) is an essential enzyme activator that forms a catalytic complex with FVII(a) and initiates coagulation by activating FIX and FX, ultimately resulting in thrombin formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TF is found in adventitia of blood vessels and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In unstable coronary syndromes, plaque rupture initiates coagulation by exposing TF to blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biologically active TF has been detected in vessel walls and circulating blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated intravascular TF has been reported in diverse pro-thrombotic syndromes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle-cell disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how TF circulates, although it may be present in pro-coagulant microparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now report identification of a form of human TF generated by alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that alternatively spliced human tissue factor (asHTF) contains most of the extracellular domain of TF but lacks a transmembrane domain and terminates with a unique <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>asHTF is soluble, circulates in blood, exhibits pro-coagulant activity when exposed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, and is incorporated into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that binding of asHTF to the edge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> growth by creating a surface that both initiates and propagates coagulation </plain></SENT>
