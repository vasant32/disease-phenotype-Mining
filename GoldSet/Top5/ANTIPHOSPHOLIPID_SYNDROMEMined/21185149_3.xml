<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent pregnancy loss and a history of thrombotic events have often been noted to have autoantibodies directed at annexin A5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of these autoantibodies to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> is still unknown, although it has been proposed that they have a direct effect on the function of annexin A5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annexin A5 may be a significant immunological target with pathologic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Essentially, annexin A5 is an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein that crystallizes over negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces and thereby blocks them from availability for coagulation reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we have taken advantage of our expertise with atomic force microscopy and studied anti-annexin A5 autoantibodies isolated from patients and focused on the ability of these antibodies to influence annexin A5 crystallization on planar mica-supported <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report herein that such antibodies from patients, but not controls, produced a significant disruption of incomplete annexin A5 crystalline shield on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IgG fraction isolated from such patients significantly decreased the velocity of annexin A5 crystallization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atomic force microscopy is a powerful tool to study the pathologic mechanisms of autoantibodies and the data herein reflect the potential of anti-annexin A5 antibodies that produce pathology in a number of varied but overlapping clinical conditions, including autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
