<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the association of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLa) and TAO has been previously recognized, the prevalence and the clinical impact of this association remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCLa were measured by double ELISA in patients with TAO (n = 47), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004416'>premature atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (pASO) (n=48) and otherwise healthy individuals (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody status was then compared to clinical presentation and outcomes in patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for TAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aCLa was significantly higher in patients with TAO (36%) compared to either pASO (8%; p = 0.01) or healthy individuals (2%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with TAO and a high antibody titer tended to be younger and suffer a significantly higher rate of major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> compared to those without the antibody (100% versus 17%; p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of TAO not significantly altered by the presence of aCLa included upper limb involvement, digital <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TAO is associated with an increased prevalence of aCLa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of a high antibody titer in these patients is associated with increased morbidity, including major limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for TAO, screening for aCLa should be considered </plain></SENT>
