<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mitral valve is most commonly affected, followed by the aortic valve, whereas tricuspid and pulmonary valves are seldom involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Libman-Sacks vegetations can be found in approximately 1 of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> by transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE), and they are variably associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> duration, disease activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The capability to perform real-time 3D (RT3D) imaging in the evaluation of Libman-Sacks vegetation size may strengthen the already established role of transthoracic echocardiogram and TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exact estimation of vegetation size may influence therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we are trying to highlight the role of RT3D echocardiography in assessing vegetation size in a patient with Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
