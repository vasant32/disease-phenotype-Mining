<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further examine antigen recognition profiles and T-cell helper activity in beta2GPI-reactive T cells, 14 CD4(+) T-cell clones specific to beta2GPI were generated from 3 patients with APS by repeated stimulation of peripheral blood T cells with recombinant beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At least 4 distinct T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were identified, but the majority of the beta2GPI-specific T-cell clones responded to a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> encompassing amino acid residues 276 to 290 of beta2GPI (KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY; single-letter amino acid codes) that contains the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site in the context of the DRB4*0103 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 beta2GPI-specific T-cell clones were able to stimulate autologous peripheral blood B cells to promote anti-beta2GPI antibody production in the presence of recombinant beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T-cell helper activity was exclusively found in T-cell clones capable of producing interleukin 6 (IL-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro anti-beta2GPI antibody production induced by T-cell clones was inhibited by anti-IL-6 or anti-CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, exogenous IL-6 augmented anti-beta2GPI antibody production in cultures of the T-cell clone lacking IL-6 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that beta2GPI-specific CD4(+) T cells in patients with APS preferentially recognize the antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site and have the capacity to stimulate B cells to produce anti-beta2GPI antibodies through IL-6 expression and CD40-CD40 ligand engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are potentially useful for clarifying the pathogenesis of APS and for developing therapeutic strategies that suppress pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production in these patients </plain></SENT>
