<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rarely, this disorder requires treatment and, due to the shared characteristics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), similar rules are followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in patients who required splenectomy after being refractory to steroids and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five APS patients with a platelet count of &lt; 100 x 10(9)/l at least twice were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic response or remission was considered when the platelet count was &gt; 100 x 10(9)/l after 1 month and with no relapse on stopping or tapering the steroid dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No response or refractory disease was defined as an absence of increase in platelet count, a total count that never exceeded 50 x 10(9)/l during treatment or when the dose requirements were such that the patient developed serious side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients were classified as having secondary APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and five were identified as primary APS (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was performed in 11 cases (20%), two PAPS and nine SLE-APS, with an average time of 28 +/- 9 months after the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were initially characterized as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (six SLE-APS, two PAPS) with an average time of 4.4 +/- 1.1 yr until the APS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two were responsive to splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Splenectomy was required in 11 (20%) of the patients with APS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a high rate of good and long-term response </plain></SENT>
