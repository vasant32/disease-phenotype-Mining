<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical course of 50 adults (30 men, 20 women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> diagnosed in our department from 1979 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 90+/-78 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided into two groups: group 1 included those without underlying disease and group 2 included those with severe underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At presentation, the median age was 54 years, and 33 patients were hypertensive, 31 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268732" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nephritic syndrome</z:e>, eight had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and 11 had non-nephrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 were significantly older and had a significantly higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> than patients of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 21 patients in group 2, nine had liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, five <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002110'>bronchiectasis</z:hpo>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassaemia intermedia</z:e>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> and one had anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up, five patients had died, 21 patients were in complete remission, ten had partial remission, ten had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and three were on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that an underlying disease (P=0.04) and interstitial infiltration at biopsy (P=0.036) were predictors of incomplete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A correlation analysis between the year of diagnosis and the clinical/ histological characteristics at presentation showed that age (P=0.05), atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (P=0.01), underlying disease (P=0.01) and interstitial infiltration at biopsy (P=0.02) increased over time, while the number of patients with complete remission significantly decreased (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> may progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> in a consistent number of adult hospitalized patients, particularly in those with an underlying disease and when associated with interstitial infiltration at biopsy </plain></SENT>
