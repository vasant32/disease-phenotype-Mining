<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and one with a '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>' had occlusive ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> affecting a variety of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gives a prevalence of occlusive ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> of 8% in this subgroup of patients, significantly higher than the 0.5-2.0% previously reported in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients also suffered from cerebrovascular disease, supporting the previously documented association between occlusive ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease in SLE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that patients with SLE and raised anticardiolipin antibodies have a higher risk of developing occlusive ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> than has been previously reported </plain></SENT>
