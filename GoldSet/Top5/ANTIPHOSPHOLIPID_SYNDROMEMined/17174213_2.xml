<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial assessment allowed the diagnosis of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and an intracardiac mass suggestive of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">heart tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type II <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> (HIT) was diagnosed on the 18th day of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence it was decided to remove the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumour</z:e> surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed using danaparoid in a state of deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, in accordance with the well-established protocol in use in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the CPB and surgical procedure came to an end a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> began forming in the circuit, requiring immediate displacement of the CPB cannulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anti-Xa activity level obtained had been considered effective at an estimated 1.20 IU/ml, although, the level recommended by Magnani is between 1.50 and 2.0 IU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no clinical consequence and postoperative recovery was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between the satisfactory level of anti-Xa activity and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the CPB circuit raises the issue of the diversity of published anticoagulation protocols, the difficulty to extrapolate within a surgical team, the need for intensive laboratory monitoring within a narrow therapeutic range, as well as the patient profiles variability with concurrent disorders complicating their clinical management </plain></SENT>
