<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the term proposed for these cases was seronegative APS (SN-APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clinical usefulness of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining in detecting serum aPL in patients presenting clinical features of SN-APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from 36 patients with SN-APS, 19 patients with APS, 18 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 20 anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV)-positive subjects and 32 healthy controls were examined for aPL using TLC immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-β(2) -<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I, anti-annexin II, anti-annexin V and anti-prothrombin antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eahy926, a human-derived endothelial cell line, was incubated with immunoglobulin (Ig)G fraction from SN-APS patients and analysis of phospho-interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and phospho-nuclear factor (NF)-κB was performed by Western blot, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression by cytofluorimetric analysis and supernatants tissue factor (TF) levels by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TLC immunostaining showed aPL in 58·3% of SN-APS patients: anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in 47·2%, anti-lyso(bis)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> in 41·7% and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> in 30·5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 36 patients showed anti-annexin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incubation of Eahy926 cells with IgG from SN-APS induced IRAK phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, VCAM-1 surface expression and TF cell release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLC immunostaining could identify the presence of aPL in patients with SN-APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the results suggest the proinflammatory and procoagulant effects in vitro of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
