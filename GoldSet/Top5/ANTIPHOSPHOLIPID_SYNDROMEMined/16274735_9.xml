<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Flow mediated (FMD) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate (GTN) induced dilation of the right brachial artery were studied in 25 patients with PAPS and 25 controls matched by age, sex and conventional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen, D-dimer, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigens and activities were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (SD) FMD was significantly lower in PAPS than in controls (8+/-5% vs. 15+/-6%, P&lt;0.001); GTN-induced dilation did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the baseline diameter of the brachial artery and duration of the disease (-0.56, P&lt;0.05) and between GTN induced dilation and duration of the disease (0.51, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (P&lt;0.001), intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (P&lt;0.001) and fibrinogen (P&lt;0.05) were higher in patients than in controls but no differences were observed for D-dimer, t-PA and PAI-1 antigens and activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was correlation between concentration of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and FMD (-0.35, P&lt;0.05) and between intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 and FMD (-0.41, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that endothelial function is impaired in patients with primary APS, possibly contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and thromboembolic complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
