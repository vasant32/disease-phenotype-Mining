<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), which is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, has been noted in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and aPL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thrombocytopenic episodes were searched for in a random sample of 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stored sera obtained during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, which was defined as platelet count below 130 x 10(9)/L, were examined by 2 different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and for IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was performed by use of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with the prevalence of aPL in 20 consecutive nonthrombocytopenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six cases with thrombocytopenic episodes were found in the group of 83 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased IgG and IgM aCL were detected in 1 patient, who also had elevated IgG aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive test result solely for IgM aCL was found in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent in both ELISA for aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients were being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the group of nonthrombocytopenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, elevated IgG aCL and IgG aPS were consistently detected in 1 patient in both ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three other patients had positive results in single tests, which were not confirmed by the second assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, aPTT was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is a rare finding in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A similar prevalence of aPL in thrombocytopenic and nonthrombocytopenic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> provides no evidence that aPL play a major role in the pathogenesis of these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> is more likely caused by the myelotoxic effect of preceding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We found a frequency of aPL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> that exceeds frequencies seen in the general population but does not approximate those detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and closely related disorders </plain></SENT>
