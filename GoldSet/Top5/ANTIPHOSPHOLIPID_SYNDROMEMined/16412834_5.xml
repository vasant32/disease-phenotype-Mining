<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of thrombotic and non-thrombotic manifestations may accompany the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of aPL in a cohort of over 350 unselected patients from a neurological clinic and studied the neurological manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that within this cohort the prevalence of aPL was about 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with aPL suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died from spinal infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-thrombotic manifestations also occurred in 40% of these patients, such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations of the titres or different types of aPL and the type of the neurological symptoms could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to age and sex matched patients of the cohort where the presence of aPL could be excluded, the occurrence of non-thrombotic manifestations was significantly more frequent and varied in the group of patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the non-APS group could be explained by the significantly higher presence of other laboratory risk factors, mainly hypercholesterinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This investigation indicates that aPL may play an important role in the etiology of various neurological syndromes </plain></SENT>
