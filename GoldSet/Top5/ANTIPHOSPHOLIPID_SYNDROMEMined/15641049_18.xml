<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the consequences of the valine/leucine polymorphism at position 247 of the beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) gene in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), by investigating the correlation between genotypes and the presence of anti-beta(2)GPI antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies was characterized using recombinant Val(247) and Leu(247) beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five Japanese patients with APS and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> who were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and 61 controls were analyzed for the presence of the Val/Leu(247) polymorphism of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism assignment was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recombinant Val(247) and Leu(247) beta(2)GPI were established to compare the reactivity of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies to beta(2)GPI between these variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variants were prepared on polyoxygenated plates or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-coated plates, and the reactivity of a series of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies (immunized anti-human beta(2)GPI monoclonal antibodies [Cof-19-21] and autoimmune anti-beta(2)GPI monoclonal antibodies [EY1C8, EY2C9, and TM1G2]) and IgGs purified from patient sera was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive correlation between the Val(247) allele and the presence of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies was observed in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human monoclonal/polyclonal anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies showed higher binding to recombinant Val(247) beta(2)GPI than to Leu(247) beta(2)GPI, although no difference in the reactivity of the immunized anti-beta(2)GPI between these variants was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conformational optimization showed that the replacement of Leu(247) by Val(247) led to a significant alteration in the tertiary structure of domain V and/or the domain IV-V interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Val(247) beta(2)GPI allele was associated with both a high frequency of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies and stronger reactivity with anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies compared with the Leu(247) beta(2)GPI allele, suggesting that the Val(247) beta(2)GPI allele may be one of the genetic risk factors for development of APS </plain></SENT>
