<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These Abs are primarily directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins, particularly β(2)GPI, and activate endothelial cells (ECs) in a β(2)GPI-dependent manner after binding of β(2)GPI to EC annexin A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because annexin A2 is not a transmembrane protein, the mechanisms of APLA/anti-β(2)GPI Ab-mediated EC activation are uncertain, although a role for a TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent pathway leading to activation of NF-κB has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we confirm a critical role for TLR4 in anti-β(2)GPI Ab-mediated EC activation and demonstrate that signaling through TLR4 is mediated through the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex on the EC surface that includes annexin A2, TLR4, calreticulin, and nucleolin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An essential role for each of these proteins in cell activation is suggested by the fact that inhibiting the expression of each using specific siRNAs blocked EC activation mediated by APLAs/anti-β(2)GPI Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide new evidence for novel protein-protein interactions on ECs that may contribute to EC activation and the pathogenesis of APLA/anti-β(2)GPI-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and suggest potential new targets for therapeutic intervention in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
