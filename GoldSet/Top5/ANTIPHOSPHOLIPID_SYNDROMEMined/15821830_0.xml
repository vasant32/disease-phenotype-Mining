<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients (60%) had clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (42.2%) had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and eight (17.7%) had a history of recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aBeta(2)-GP1 was (IgG) was positive in 23 (51.1%), aCL in 13 (28.8%), and LAC in four (8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 14 (73.6%) were positive for abeta(2)-GP1, eight (42.1%) for aCL, and none of them was positive for LAC </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that presence of abeta(2)-GP1 increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and therefore should be looked for in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of SLE to consider prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
