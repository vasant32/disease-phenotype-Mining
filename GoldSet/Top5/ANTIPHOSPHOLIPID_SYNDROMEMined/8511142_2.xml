<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> due to bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal haemorrhage</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 1st patient had repeated episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on a background of altered general condition; he was examined by computed tomography (CT) which showed enlarged and presumably tumoral adrenal glands; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> was present and improved under hormone replacement therapy; the thrombotic episodes were attributed to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>; after a 5-year follow-up the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> remained alone, and further examinations showed progressive adrenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 2nd patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> CT was performed, showing bilateral adrenal enlargement; treatment with intravenous pulses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and high-dose immunoglobulins combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> failed, and splenectomy was performed disclosing an old adrenal haematoma which was evacuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3rd patient had bilateral and asymmetrical adrenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> at CT; subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was diagnosed with anti-prothrombinase and anticardiolipin accounting for the initial findings; follow-up examinations showed the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_468'>pseudocysts</z:mpath> in the adrenals; following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> the patient died of cerebral haemorrhage, and autopsy confirmed the presence of old, bilateral adrenal haematomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4th patient had recurrent vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, which prompted CT in search of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>; this examination revealed 2 large adrenal haematomas while anticardiolipin antibodies were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> any functional or morphological abnormality of the adrenals should prompt a search for bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal haemorrhage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> a search for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> should be part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aetiological investigations, and this search should be carried out prior to withdrawing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
