<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that binding of beta2GPI to AnPLs was enhanced by biotinylation of its glycan chains with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35362">hydrazide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated why this chemical modification of beta2GPI increased both its affinity for AnPLs and its recognition by anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophoretic analysis showed that: (i) high molecular mass beta2GPI (dimers and other oligomers) covalently coupled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24783">imine</z:chebi> bonds, were present in variable amounts in oxidized beta2GPI and in beta2GPI-bh (beta2GPI-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35362">hydrazide</z:chebi>), but were absent in native beta2GPI; (ii) binding of beta2GPI-bh to phosphatidylserine-coated microtitre plates generated high molecular mass polymers in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Native beta2GPI did not polymerize in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These polymers did not bind more strongly to AnPLs than the monomer beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in solution at 1 microM beta2GPI-bh essentially appeared as a dimer as revealed by light-scattering analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPR (surface plasmon resonance) analysis showed that the increased affinity of beta2GPI-bh for AnPL monolayers was due to a lower dissociation rate constant compared with native beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the monoclonal human aCL (auto-immune anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody) EY2C9 bound to beta2GPI-bh but did not bind to monomeric native and oxidized beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the dimeric quaternary structure of beta2GPI-bh is in fact responsible for the appearance of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> targeted by the EY2C9 antibody </plain></SENT>
