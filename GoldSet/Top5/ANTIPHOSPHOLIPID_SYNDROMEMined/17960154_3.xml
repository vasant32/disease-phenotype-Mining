<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the pathogenesis of PAPS, we have investigated the gene expression profiles that characterize peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that the transcriptional activity of genes involved in innate immune responses, such as toll-like receptor 8 and CD14, as well as downstream genes of this pathway, such as STAT1, OAS2, TNFSF13 and PLSCR1 are significantly increased in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of monocyte-specific cytokines is also elevated in PAPS mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results reveal a 'response to pathogen' signature in PAPS, which could reflect an altered monocyte activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, microarray analyses also revealed a reduced expression of genes coding for proteins involved in transcriptional control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a significant proportion of them exhibit E2F-binding sites in their promoter, suggesting that a deregulated RB/E2F activity could play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
