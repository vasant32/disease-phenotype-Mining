<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with multisystem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> refractory to conventional immunosuppressive medications, each with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement, were treated with four weekly infusions of rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical and laboratory responses were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each of the patients had improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with autoimmune cytopenias and autoimmune <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disease had resolution of the cytopenias and marked improvement in neurologic symptoms; he currently receives no immunosuppressive medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two half-siblings with lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, pulmonary nodules, and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease had improvement of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fourth patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> secondary to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome had improvement in fine and gross motor function and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The biologic response modifier rituximab, designed to eliminate B lymphocytes, was safe and effective in four pediatric patients with multisystem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It appears to be beneficial in autoimmune conditions presumably mediated by a variety of B-cell-related mechanisms, and may decrease or eliminate the need for other immunosuppressive medications </plain></SENT>
