<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies directed at β(2)GPI are accepted as a classification criterion for APS, while the presence of antiprothrombin antibodies is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present article, we investigated the possible role of antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT) as marker of APS on a cohort of 295 individuals with APS (95 primary APS and 45 secondary APS) and APS-related diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found aPS/PT to be highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (immunoglobulin G [IgG] aPS/PT odds ratio [OR], 7.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.97-13.92 and IgM aPS/PT OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.35-4.77) and obstetric abnormalities (IgG aPS/PT OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.04-5.43), but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A very high degree of concordance between the concentration of aPS/PT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we support the inclusion of aPS/PT determination as second-level assay to confirm APS classification </plain></SENT>
