<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains of beta(2)GPI-reactive T cells were examined in 8 beta(2)GPI-responders, including 5 patients with APS and 3 healthy subjects, using polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis combined with in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells with recombinant beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TCR Vbeta segments that expanded oligoclonally after stimulation with beta(2)GPI varied among responders, but the Vbeta7 and Vbeta8 segments were commonly detected in 6 and 4 beta(2)GPI-responders, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the complementarity-determining region 3 sequence of beta(2)GPI-reactive T cells revealed limited diversity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Vbeta7(+) TCRs had an amino acid motif of TGxxN/Q or minor variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Vbeta8(+) TCRs had another motif, PxAxxD/E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, an identical Vbeta7(+) TCRbeta chain was used by beta(2)GPI-reactive T cells in 3 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent difference in the TCRbeta usage between APS patients and healthy responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some of the Vbeta7(+) TCRs with the TGxxN/Q motif detected by PCR-SSCP analysis were also used by beta(2)GPI-specific CD4(+) T-cell clones responsive to an immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> containing the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of Vbeta7(+) or Vbeta8(+) T cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures significantly inhibited in vitro anti-beta(2)GPI antibody production in response to beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate preferential usage of TCRbeta chains by beta(2)GPI-reactive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These TCRbeta chains can be reasonable targets for TCR-based immunotherapy for patients with APS </plain></SENT>
