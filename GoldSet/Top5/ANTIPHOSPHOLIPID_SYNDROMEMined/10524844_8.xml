<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Of the 32 patients who were confirmed to have PAPS among 751 patients with elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> during a 2 year period, we retrospectively reviewed the 14 patients who underwent abdominal CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical indications for abdominal CT included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo>, or lower leg swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT findings were analyzed with regard to the abdominal vascular system and abdominal organ involvement patterns as well as ancillary findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 patients with PAPS, 10 had involvement of the venous system (72%), 2 of the arterial system (14%), and 2 of both systems (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients who had venous system involvement, 4 had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the inferior vena cava (IVC), 2 in both the IVC and the hepatic vein, 1 in the IVC and splenic and portal veins, 1 in the IVC and hepatic and adrenal veins, 1 in the hepatic, portal, and renal veins, and 3 in the portal and superior mesenteric veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> developed in five of the nine patients who had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the IVC or hepatic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was noted in four patients, hepatic artery in two, aorta in one, renal artery in one, pancreatic arcade in one, and splenic artery in one, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of multiple organs including the liver, jejunum, colon, kidney, and adrenal gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 14 patients (50%) manifested <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of multiple extra-abdominal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PAPS should be included in the differential diagnosis when CT demonstrates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in multiple organs or patients have recurrent episodes of venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
