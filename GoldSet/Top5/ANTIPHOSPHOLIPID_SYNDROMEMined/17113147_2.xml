<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to establish the placental localisation of ABCA1 and to investigate whether ABCA1 expression is altered in placentas from pregnancies complicated by pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein localisation studies were carried out using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein was localised to the apical syncytium of placental villi and endothelia of fetal blood vessels within the villi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was reduced in placentas from women with APS when compared to controls (p&lt;0.001), and this was paralleled by reductions in ABCA1 protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in ABCA1 expression between placentas from pre-eclamptic pregnancies and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The localisation of ABCA1 in human placenta is consistent with a role in cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ABCA1 protein in APS may reflect reduced cholesterol transport to the fetus affecting the formation of cell membranes and decreasing the level of substrate available for steroidogenesis </plain></SENT>
