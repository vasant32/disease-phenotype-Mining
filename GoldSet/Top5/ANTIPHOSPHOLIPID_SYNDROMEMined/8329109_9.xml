<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has not been fully explored what kind of specificities are most relevant to recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the effects of specific APLs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent aborters</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: IgG and IgM antibodies against PE (treated with 1% <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>) and five negatively-charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were measured by ELISA among 334 recurrent aborters without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationships between APL specificities and subsequent pregnancy outcome were prospectively investigated in 38 recurrent aborters with positive APL who did not receive treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels exceeding the 99th percentile of 280 healthy women were considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive IgG and/or IgM APLs were detected in 14%, IgG APLs in 12%, and IgG antibodies against PA, PG, PI, PS, CL and PE, respectively, in 9%, 7%, 7%, 7%, 8%, and 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study of the 38 untreated patients, fetal loss recurred in 82% of the 33 IgG APL-positive patients, but in 40% of the five patients positive for only IgM APLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of fetal loss in the next pregnancy of patients with IgG specific APL-positive against PE, PI, PS, or Cl was even higher at 90% and over, and fetal loss recurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 21 patients with two or more IgG APL-positive against PE, PI, PS, or CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest the possibility that two or more IgG APL-positive value against treated PE, PI, PS, or CL, may be more accurate as a predictive variable than that of only one IgG APL-positive in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
