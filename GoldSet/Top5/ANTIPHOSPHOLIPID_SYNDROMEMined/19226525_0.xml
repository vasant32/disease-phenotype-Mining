<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels of these patients are higher than in general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because AFP is involved in the calculation of the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (T21), we studied the effect of AFP variations in the presence of aPL during T21 screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group (aPL group) was comprised of 64 pregnancies in women with aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group was comprised of 21 655 pregnancies included in the national program for routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (DS) screening by maternal serum markers [human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and AFP] between 14 + 0 and 18 + 6 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AFP values, converted in logarithm of multiples of the median (MoM), were significantly higher in the aPL group (0.03 vs 0.10; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a matricial transformation of AFP MoM and hCG MoM in the aPL group, new T21 risks presented a median of one in 1665 versus one in 2574 (p &lt; 0.0001 with a rank-sign test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the fact that in the presence of aPL antibodies, the calculated risk of T21 is underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clinicians should interpret the screening borderline results in aPL patients with caution </plain></SENT>
