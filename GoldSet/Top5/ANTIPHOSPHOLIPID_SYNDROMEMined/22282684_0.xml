<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available about the relationship between this kind of interference and the daily clinical management of oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of two different thromboplastins-RecombiPlasTin 2G and HepatoComplex-in the determination of INR values of several patients' ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> for a previous thrombotic disorder with and without positivity to LAC, and to evaluate possible interferences in the daily therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 16 patients (13 females and 3 males, mean age 59 ± 16 years) with LAC positivity ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and 11 control subjects (7 females and 4 males, mean age 58 ± 14.5 years) with similar characteristics (ie, ethnic background and weight) with LAC negativity ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>165 assays for INR determination were analyzed from both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P values were considered significant if &lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean values of INR for patients with LAC positivity were 3.79 ± 1.63 when tested with RecombiPlasTin 2G vs 3.18 ± 1.15 when tested with HepatoComplex (P &lt; 0.001, s); while mean values of INR for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) with LAC negativity were 3.54 ± 1.39 when tested with RecombiPlasTin 2G vs 3.23 ± 1.14 when tested with HepatoComplex (P &lt; 0.002, s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An INR value &gt; than 4.5 was found in 31/165 samples in 9 subjects, 8 patients with LAC positivity, and 1 control group subject with LAC negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a great difference in INR values in these subjects if we use the common thromboplastin (ie, RecombiPlasTin 2G) with a INR range varying from 5.14 ± 0.35 vs 3.79 ± 0.38 if we use another thromboplastin (ie, HepatoComplex) (P &lt; 0.001, s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A change in the therapeutic approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> is possible in these cases because different INR values were obtained using different thromboplastins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our data confirm that INR evaluation does not reveal significant changes also if tested with two different thromboplastins, for patients ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> with and without LAC positivity, when the INR value is &lt; than 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over this INR value there is a significant difference in patients with LAC positivity if we use a different thromboplastin for the INR determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this reason values obtained by RecombiPlasTin 2G need to be confirmed and matched with another thromboplastin (ie, HepatoComplex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This approach may be useful in order to have a good INR testing for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> long-term treatment with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> in particular in patients with LAC positivity </plain></SENT>
