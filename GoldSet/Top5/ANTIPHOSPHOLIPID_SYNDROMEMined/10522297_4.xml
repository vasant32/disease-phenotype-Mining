<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Annexin V, a protein with potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity has a calcium-dependent binding affinity for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Annexin V is distributed in many organs, especially in the placenta and endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various studies have shown that placental annexin V is decreased in women with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that annexin V might be a target of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies and that the subsequent decrease in annexin V might be associated with obstetrical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the presence of anti-annexin V antibodies in the plasma of women with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and obstetrical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were present in 87% and 30% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A group of 40 healthy women were included in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-annexin V IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The IgG mean OD was 0.07 +/- 0.013 in patients and 0.042 +/- 0.06 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only two out of the 23 patients and two out of the 40 healthy women were positive for IgG (OD &gt; 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the assay was poor (8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even when the threshold was adjusted according to the mean OD in control subjects +2 SD, the sensitivity was still poor, reaching only 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anti-annexin V was low in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and repetitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Anti-annexin V assay does not appear to be sensitive enough for the identification of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies that might be involved in the decrease in annexin V leading subsequently to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
