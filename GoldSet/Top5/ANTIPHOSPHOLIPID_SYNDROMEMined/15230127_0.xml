<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 98 patients with different forms of SV were examined: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonspecific aortoarteritis</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>, n = 18), nodular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264992" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis</z:e> (NP, n = 18), Wegener <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, n = 20), obliterating thrombangiitis (OT, n = 21), and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (HV, n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and 20 donors comprised a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPR-3 and aMPO were detected by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay using kits ORGenTec Diagnostica GmbH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aPR-3 were detected in 1 (5.6%) patient with NP and in 3 (14.3%) patients with HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aPR-3 were detected in 13 (65%) of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> being significantly more frequent not only vs controls (0%) but in some forms of SV and PAPS (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean aPR-3 level in 13 WG patients was significantly higher than in 4 patients (1 with NP and 3 with HV) the sera of whom also contained aPR-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>84.6% patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> had higher concentrations of aPR-3, this is significantly more frequently than in the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In NP and HV these autoantibodies were encountered in the serum only in moderate or low concentrations in patients with high clinicolaboratory activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> patients there was no correlation between aPR-3 presence, form of the disease and basic clinical manifestations, but mean values of index of clinical activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were significantly higher in patients with aPR-3 than in those free of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concentration of aPR-3 in an active phase of the disease was significantly higher than in patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aPR-3 were detected in 83.3% cases in active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and in 37.5% patients without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Detection of aPR-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> group was associated with mean sensitivity and good specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In examination of the patients in an active phase specificity rose but sensitivity fell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Optimal results were obtained in estimation of aPR-3 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, in moderate or high concentration, aPR-3 have good sensitivity and high specificity for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, in a high titer (&gt; 15 U/ml) they are highly sensitive and specific for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>aMPO were detected in 1 of 18 patients with NP, in 1 of 21--with OT, in 3 of 21--with HV and in 2 of 21--with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>None patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> or PAPS had aMPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>aMPO were detected in NP and HV in high activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Part of the patients had affected kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> is characterized by the presence and high concentration of aPR-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the latter case aPR-3 have high (100%) sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Detection of aPR-3 can be used as an additional laboratory test for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and estimation of its activity </plain></SENT>
