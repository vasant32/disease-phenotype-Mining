<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Authors report on the case of a 4-year-old boy, admitted to the pediatric department for left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan of the brain was negative on the day of admission but, on the following day, showed 3 small hypodense focal lesions in the posterior branch of the internal capsule, in the knee of the internal capsule and in the posterior parietal region of the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase almost completely resolved in 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty days after presentation, cerebral angiography showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of an anterior, right perforating vessel, together with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the horizontal portion of the cerebral anterior artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The determination of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, even though performed far from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the disease, showed a low IgG positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> the neurological symptoms completely resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, narrowing and other lesions of cerebral vessel, it is possible to hypotesize that the occurrence of thrombotic fenomen, ascribable to anti-phaspholipid antibodies, is responsible for the neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies suggest that the assessment of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies should be routinely performed in the presence of thrombotic phenomena </plain></SENT>
