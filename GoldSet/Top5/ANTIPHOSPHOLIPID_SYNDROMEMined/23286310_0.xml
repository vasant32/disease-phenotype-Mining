<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present grave outcome due to lack of anticoagulation in a patient with artificial mitral valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old male known to have an artificial valve was hospitalized in another hospital due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-coagulation therapy was not provided during that hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was transferred to our hospital due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0007340'>lower limb weakness</z:hpo> and diagnosed by us as having extensive emboli disease with complete occlusion of the distal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in the abdominal organs and leg muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He suffered from multiple organ failure and eventually died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neglecting the common practice of anticoagulation to a patient with a mechanical heart valve may, in rare cases, lead to immediate catastrophic event caused by shower thrombemboli with disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> from the left atrium to the abdominal aorta causing complete occlusion, spleen, kidney and muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
