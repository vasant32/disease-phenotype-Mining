<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty two non pregnant women attending our recurrent spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> clinic were recruited for this prospective study and subsequently divided to group A ( n=35) involving recurrent spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anticardiolipin antibodies values and group B ( n=27) for those with abnormal anticardiolipin antibodies values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were measured in the blood using the standardized enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-mode, pulsed, color and power Doppler transvaginal ultrasonography was used to estimate the uterine artery pulsatility index, spiral artery resistance index, intraovarian arterial resistance index and endometrial thickness on the 21st day of a regular 28-day unstimulated menstrual cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS 9.0 Windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;/=0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in values of Doppler indices characterizing uterine and intraovarian arterial flows in women having a history of recurrent spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (RSM) with presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were a significantly higher number of women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anticardiolipin antibodies above 30 years having a history of six or more RSM [7 (31.8)] compared to RSM women with abnormal anticardiolipin antibodies [0 (0)] ( p&lt;0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher incidence of the primary RSM was found in group A [16 (64.0)] compared to group B [9 (36.0)] ( p&lt;/=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A consistently similar difference pattern was observed between the mean intraovarian arterial resistance index value in group A primary RSM [0.54 (0.40-0.63)] compared to a more favorable mean intraovarian arterial resistance index value in group B secondary RSM [0.46 (0.43-0.58)] ( p&lt;/=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study did not confirm any statistically significant difference in values of Doppler indices characterizing uterine and intraovarian arterial flows of RSM women with presence or absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in the midluteal phase of unstimulated menstrual cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that a mild form of APS will not result in any significant impairment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> occurring at time of implantation of fertilized ovum </plain></SENT>
