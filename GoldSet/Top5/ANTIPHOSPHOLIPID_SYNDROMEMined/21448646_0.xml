<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are some reports due to a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in HIV-infected women compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was demonstrating the impact of gender on serum concentration of antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 58 HIV-infected patients and 58 age, sex-matched healthy adults were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured platelets count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, partial thromboplastin time (PTT); prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), antiphospholipid IgG/IgM and anticardiolipin IgG/IgM serotypes in our studied population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, male-to-female ratio, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, PT, INR, antiphospholipid IgM isotype, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG isotypes levels were not significantly different between HIV-infected patients and healthy individuals, when CD4+ T-cell count, CD8+ T-cell count, platelet count, and PTT were significantly lower, and antiphospholipid IgG isotype levels was significantly higher in HIV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid IgG isotypes (3.2 [2.8-4.2] vs. 2.5 [2.3-3.1]; P &lt; 0.001) and anticardiolipin IgG isotypes (2.2 [1.9-2.7] vs. 1.4 [1.4-1.9]; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in HIV-infected women than in HIV-infected men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid IgG/IgM and anticardiolipin IgG/IgM were significantly correlated in HIV-infected men and women when they did not had any correlation in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> accelerate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in women more profoundly than in men, as a result of differences in disease progression and response to therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
