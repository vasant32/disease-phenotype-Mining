<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical presentations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, focal neurologic deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and decreased level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors identified were pregnancy/ puerperium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, oral contraceptive pills, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple sinuses were affected in 51 patients (45.9%) </plain></SENT>
