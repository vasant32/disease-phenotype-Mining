<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the stability of maternal autoantibody levels during pregnancy, we followed Ro52, Ro60 and La autoantibody IgG level variation and Ro52 subclass profiles longitudinally in selected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>congenital heart block</z:hpo> risk pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were obtained from 12 Ro/La positive women diagnosed with a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> and followed on average 60 months (range two to 84) which included 13 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven children were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal lupus</z:e>, whereof four developed complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>congenital heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum was also collected from the babies at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ro52, Ro60 and La IgG as well as subclass antibodies were analysed by ELISA using recombinant antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six Ro/La negative rheumatic patients were included as controls for antibody levels during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ro52, Ro60 and La IgG levels decreased progressively from early to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e>, significantly for Ro52 and Ro60 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No peaks or persistent elevation of antibody levels were noted in any of the CHB risk pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ro52 IgG1 antibody levels were significantly higher than IgG2 (P &lt; 0.01), IgG3 (P &lt; 0.01) and IgG4 (P &lt; 0.05) levels in the mothers during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ro52 IgG1 and IgG4 levels decreased significantly from early to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> (P = 0.02), while levels of IgG2 and IgG3 were low and the decrease was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IgG subclasses were transferred to the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that maternal levels of Ro52, Ro60 and La autoantibodies tended rather to decrease than to increase during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
