<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fibrillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> is a rare cause of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, often leading to the need for dialysis within a few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of immunosuppressive treatment is still uncertain although this has been tried with variable success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year old woman with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (IgM anticardiolipin antibodies) was seen in the nephrology clinic with haematuria, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and worsening renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A renal biopsy demonstrated a mesangial proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> on light microscopy and smaller fibrils (10.6-13.8 nm in diameter) than is usual for fibrillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> (typically 18-22 nm) on electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> was excluded following detailed evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On account of rapidly worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> she was started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> which led to the partial recovery and stabilization of her renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case highlights the need for routine electron microscopy in native renal biopsies, where the differential diagnosis is wide and varied and the light and immunofluorescence microscopic findings may be non specific </plain></SENT>
