<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rare cases of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="45927">TEP</z:chebi> occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients, but the physiopathology of this condition remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case-control study, we examined whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the beta2GPI gene contributed to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> and APS co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNPs Ser88Asn, Leu247Val, Cys306Gly and Trp316Ser were identified in 113 Brazilian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, anti-beta2GPI antibodies and plasma concentrations of beta2GPI were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ser88Asn, Cys306Gly and Trp316Ser SNPs were not risk factors for APS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of Val/Val homozygosity was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients compared to controls (36 vs. 5%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of MB and 17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562908" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paucibacillary leprosy</z:e> patients were positive for anti-beta2GPI IgM (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between SNP Ser88Asn or Cys306Gly and anti-beta2GPI antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MB patients with positive anti-beta2GPI IgM, the frequency of Val/Val homozygosity was higher than in controls (32 vs. 15%; P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the mutant allele Ser316 was higher in MB patients with positive rather than negative anti-beta2GPI IgM levels (6 vs. 0%; P = 0.040) and was greater than in the control group (6 vs. 1%; P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The studied polymorphisms did not influence the plasma concentrations of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Leu247Val and Trp316Ser SNPs may represent genetic risk factors for anti-beta2GPI antibody production in MB patients </plain></SENT>
