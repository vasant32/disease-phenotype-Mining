<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), activated protein C resistance (APCR) and antiphospholipid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (APL-T) syndrome and further investigate the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APL-T syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ELISA, PTT-LA and APTT +/- APC methods were used to detect anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) and APC R in 20 APL-T syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were diagnosed as APL-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACA-IgG, M and LA are strongly associated with APL-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of APCR in APL-T (75%) was significantly higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was high prevalence of APCR in APL-T, which was strongly associated with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that acquired APCR induced by <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> is a key to understanding <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in Chinese APL-T patients </plain></SENT>
