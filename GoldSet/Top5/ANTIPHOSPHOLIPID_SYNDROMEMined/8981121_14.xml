<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently developed an experimental mouse model of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, in which immunization of female mice with a monoclonal anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody resulted in substantial failure of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that pre-implantation embryos derived from ACA-injected mothers exhibited morphological abnormalities and failed to implant in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we designed embryo transfer experiments to determine whether defective embryonic development originated as a maternal defect, an embryonic defect or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embryos (3.5 day old), taken from ACA- and control-immunized mothers were transferred into either an ACA- or a control-treated uterine environment (day 2.5 pseudopregnant females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 14 of gestation the incidence of pregnancy, the average number of fetuses per female and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ACA-treated uterine environment was found to be non-supportive for the development and implantation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, embryos derived from ACA-immunized mothers, even after their removal from the ACA-environment and transfer to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uterus, remained deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that both the maternal and the embryonic compartments were defective, as a result of previous exposure to the ACA </plain></SENT>
