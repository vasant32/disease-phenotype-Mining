<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors, and incubated with aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to a 48â€‘h incubation, PBMCs were collected and detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that aPLs at higher concentrations may induce a significant increase in Th2 and Th17 frequencies, as opposed to a significant decrease in Th1 and Treg frequencies and the Th1/Th2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that there is a Th1/Th2 imbalance, a Th17 upregulation and a Treg downregulation present in APS, and that these factors are positively correlated with aPL titers, suggesting a potential role of Th cells in the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
