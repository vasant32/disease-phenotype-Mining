<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antibodies to prothrombin (APTs) and to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I are the major autoantibodies responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APTs comprise antibodies against prothrombin alone as well as antibodies against phosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex (anti-PS/PT), the latter being highly associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-PS/PT on thrombin generation has not been elucidated, and the paradoxical effect of LAC (an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in vitro, but a procoagulant in vivo) remains an enigma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of anti-PS/PT on thrombin generation and to examine the LAC paradox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 36 anti-PS/PT-positive APS patients and 127 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers of in vivo thrombin/fibrin generation, including prothrombin fragment F1+2, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, soluble fibrin monomer, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse monoclonal anti-PS/PT antibody 231D was established, and its effects on in vitro thrombin generation were investigated by chromogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly elevated levels of markers of thrombin/fibrin generation were observed in anti-PS/PT-positive patients, regardless of the presence or absence of anticardiolipin antibodies, as compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of low concentrations of human activated factor V (FVa), monoclonal antibody 231D increased thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when high concentrations of FVa were added, monoclonal antibody 231D decreased thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under a constant concentration of FVa, a high concentration of human FXa enhanced the effect of 231D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-PS/PT greatly correlated with increased thrombin generation in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The in vitro effects of monoclonal antibody 231D on thrombin generation are "biaxial" according to the FVa/FXa balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data may serve as a clue to understanding the LAC paradox and the thrombogenic properties of anti-PS/PT </plain></SENT>
