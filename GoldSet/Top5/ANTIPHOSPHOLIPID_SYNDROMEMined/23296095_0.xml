<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal removal of drugs during therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) can lead to decreased efficacy, as shown in several reports discussing altered pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antibiotics during TPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, drugs with a low volume of distribution or a high protein binding are susceptible to extracorporeal removal, as these drugs remain substantially within the intravascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No information is known about <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drug</z:chebi> removal during TPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the PKs of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patient undergoing TPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 61-year-old man, presenting with catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> for which TPE was started, developed probable pulmonary invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken under steady state conditions to calculate PK parameters of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi>, both with and without TPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PK parameters (area under the curve, Cl, Vd, and t1/2) were equivalent on both days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> has a distribution volume of 4.5 L/kg and a protein binding of 58%, suggesting that drug removal during TPE would not be clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support this assumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, it seems that TPE does not alter the PK behavior of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">Voriconazole</z:chebi> dosages should not be adjusted during TPE </plain></SENT>
