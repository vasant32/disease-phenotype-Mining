<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The systemic features of the syndrome are characterized by large variability depending on the affected organ(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, neurological and behavioural disturbances, dermatological features as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and renal, ocular, liver or valvular heart manifestations have been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, studies on the frequency and clinical presentation of the ocular manifestations as the prevailing (first) sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in patients suffering from "unexplained" ocular disease are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present three cases suffering from unexplained ocular disease as first manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the three patients were referred to our department because of unexplained ocular features from the anterior or posterior segment and unexplained neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first patient had bilateral <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> occlusive disease, the second and the third patient had unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007634'>nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</z:hpo> with macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate to high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them at baseline as well as 6 to 12 weeks after initial testing confirming the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">acenocoumarol</z:chebi> was instituted resulting in stabilization and/or improvement of ocular signs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the important diagnostic and therapeutic implications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, the possibility of ocular features as the first clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> should be kept in mind of the physicians particularly in patients with no evident risk factors for ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, prompt <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment and close follow-up seem to be essential for vision salvation and stabilization </plain></SENT>
