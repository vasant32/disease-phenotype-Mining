<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms underlying the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the pathogenesis and the prothrombotic or proinflammatory status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in the proatherothrombotic status of APS patients induced by IgG-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and the beneficial effects of supplementing cells with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> Q(10) (CoQ(10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in relevant prothrombotic and inflammatory parameters in 43 APS patients was found compared with 38 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> production, nuclear abundance of Nrf2, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymatic activity, decreased intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential were found in monocytes and neutrophils from APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>Accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in APS patients was found associated with their inflammatory or oxidative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CoQ(10) preincubation of healthy monocytes before IgG-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> treatment decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, the percentage of cells with altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, and the induced expression of tissue factor, VEGF, and Flt1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, CoQ(10) significantly improved the ultrastructural preservation of mitochondria and prevented IgG-APS-induced fission mediated by Drp-1 and Fis-1 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the oxidative perturbation in APS patient leukocytes, which is directly related to an inflammatory and pro-atherothrombotic status, relies on alterations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dynamics and metabolism that may be prevented, reverted, or both by treatment with CoQ(10) </plain></SENT>
