<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some reports have found increased serum levels in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">pre-eclamptic toxaemia</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, maternal serum inhibin A was retrospectively measured in a series of 32 serum samples from pregnant women previously diagnosed as having either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> medians were calculated from 57 unaffected control pregnancies together with a total of 854 samples tested at 13-19 weeks of gestation as part of the routine antenatal DS screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were expressed in multiples of the gestation specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> medians (MoM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cubic regression formula was fitted, weighting for the number of women tested at each gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median MoM value in the 16 cases of SLE and the 16 cases of primary APS is 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.40-0.91) and 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.66-1.17), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For primary APS this was not statistically significant, whereas the SLE patients had a highly statistically significant reduction of serum inhibin A (p&lt;0.002, Wilcoxon Rank sum Test, 2 tailed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six pregnancies in the SLE group had a complicated obstetric outcome, i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">missed abortion</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>, exacerbation of the underlying disease which necessitated delivery, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 85% of this subgroup, serum inhibin A levels were below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 10th centile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current data suggest that serum inhibin A is decreased on average in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Those preliminary results might have various obstetric implications such as antenatal DS screening of SLE patients, identification of pregnant women at risk of developing SLE, who have presented for routine DS screening and for monitoring SLE patients throughout their pregnancy </plain></SENT>
