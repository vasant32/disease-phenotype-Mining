<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Primary cytotrophoblast cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the Catholic University, Rome, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(s): Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women underwent uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(s): Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies were isolated from the plasma of two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects with the use of protein-G <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotrophoblast cells were dispersed in Ringer's bicarbonate buffer containing trypsin and DNAseI, filtered, and layered over a Percoll gradient in Hank's balanced salt solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(s): We investigated the effects of IL-3 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on trophoblast cell invasiveness, differentiation, and hormone secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT(s): IgG obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> bound to trophoblast cells, with inhibitory effects on the cells' invasiveness, differentiation, and hCG secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-3 was able to restore in vitro placental functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(s): These results imply that IL-3 favorably affects human trophoblast implantation and development </plain></SENT>
