<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distinguishing feature of CAPS is microvascular thromboses in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular mimicry between beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and infectious agents, endothelial cell activation and reduced fibrinolysis are the most frequently described pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk factors have also been implicated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CAPS, although these have not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There have been no randomized, controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of any medication on CAPS; however, when CAPS is suspected, aggressive multimodal treatment is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who receive a combination of anticoagulation therapy, glucocorticosteroids and plasma exchange with or without intravenous immunoglobulin show the best survival rates </plain></SENT>
