<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Case report of a young female patient presenting with bilateral sequential central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), which rapidly improved with systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A complete ophthalmologic examination and hematological evaluation were performed on an 18-year-old female patient presenting with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> in the left eye, secondary to a central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three years later, she experienced a central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic evaluation revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One month after the diagnosis and treatment of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion in the left eye, the patient discontinued <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, unfortunately resulting in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three years later, upon recurrence in the fellow eye, systemic anticoagulation was reinstituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over 12 months follow-up, upon complete ophthalmologic examination, the patient showed normalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the case of young patients with bilateral central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusions, hematologic evaluation should be performed so as to detect APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prompt, effective treatment is necessary to prevent further <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent thrombotic events may jeopardize anatomic and functional prognosis </plain></SENT>
