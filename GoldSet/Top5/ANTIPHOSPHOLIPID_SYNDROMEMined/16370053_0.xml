<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impairment of microvascular endothelial function has been suggested to be a mechanism of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was undertaken to assess some of the characteristics of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (pAPS) and CSX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 36 patients with CSX, 14 patients having pAPS and 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients evaluation included: clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, effort treadmill test (protocol Bruce modified), determination of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, cholesterol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were determined as markers of the inflammatory state: serum phospholipase (PL-A2) and peripheral neutrophils activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with pAPS presented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of serum cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PL-A2 activity, moderate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without APLA presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, increased PL-A2 activity, increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period we found a correlation between P1-A2 activity and ischemic episodes, but only in patients with CSX and pAPS there were registered cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with SCX and pAPS represent a distinct clinical subset, being characterized by minimal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, absence of usual risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, more severe prognosis related to recurrent thromboses and the need for early <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
