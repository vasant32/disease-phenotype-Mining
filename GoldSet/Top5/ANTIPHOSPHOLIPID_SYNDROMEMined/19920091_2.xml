<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that some autoantibodies possess the enzymatic activity, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that some aPT antibodies in APS may display prothrombinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six APS patient-derived PT-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were analysed for prothrombinase activity on PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One mAb with prothrombinase activity was examined for its proteolytic activity on PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, IgG was purified from plasma samples positive with IgG aPT antibodies, and their prothrombinase activity analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial analysis of six mAbs revealed that, upon incubation with PT, IS6 mAb displayed prothrombinase activity and catalysed the proteolysis of PT to fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of plasma samples revealed that 9/21 (42.8%) APS patients had IgG antibodies against PT, based on a cut-off value equal to mean + 3 S.D. of the level in 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, of those samples positive for IgG aPT antibodies, two polyclonal IgG (P1 and P2) also displayed prothrombinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we showed that some aPT antibodies displayed prothrombinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such catalytic aPT antibodies may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
