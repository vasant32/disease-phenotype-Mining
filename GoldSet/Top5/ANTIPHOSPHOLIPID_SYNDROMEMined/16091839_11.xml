<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also assessed the operative characteristics of IgA aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied 130 patients with SLE and 35 patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients we measured IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 and recorded any of the clinical manifestations of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL were positive in 8.5% of patients with SLE and in 40% of patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive IgA abeta(2)-GP1 were found in 17.7% of patients with SLE and in 25.7% of patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL were associated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we could not establish significant associations between IgA abeta(2)-GP1 and any of the clinical manifestations of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of the IgA in addition to IgG and IgM aCL hardly changed the operative characteristics of aCL testing, while measurement of the IgA in addition to IgG and IgM abeta(2)-GP1 increased sensitivity but with a greater loss in specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL is significantly associated with more than one of the clinical manifestations of the APS in contrast to the IgA abeta(2)-GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine measurement of the IgA isotype of both aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 does not improve the operative characteristics of aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 and therefore is not recommended at present </plain></SENT>
