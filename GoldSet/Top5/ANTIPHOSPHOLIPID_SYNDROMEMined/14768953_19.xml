<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>42 (2001), 697; 43 (2002), 1486; 44 (2003), 716] that [beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) forms complexes with oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLDL) and autoantibodies against these complexes are present in patients with SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship of beta2GPI/oxLDL complexes and IgG autoantibodies against beta2GPI complexed with oxLig-1 (an oxLDL-derived ligand) with clinical manifestations of APS was studied in 150 APS and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beta2GPI/oxLDL levels of APS patients were similar to those of SLE patients without APS, but they were significantly higher than healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the complex levels among the patients with arterial, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, or pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI/oxLig-1 levels of APS were significantly higher than those of SLE without APS and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, antibody levels of APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> were significantly higher than those patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, oxidation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> leads the complex formation with beta2GPI in SLE and APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-beta2GPI/oxLig-1 autoantibodies were generated only in APS and were strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that autoantibodies against beta2GPI/oxLDL complexes are etiologically important in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in APS </plain></SENT>
