<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective observational study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with a diagnosis of any systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> admitted to the medical ICU in a tertiary hospital between 1999 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with reduced survival were identified by means of log rank test and backward stepwise Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (26 females) were included with median age being 44.3 years (interquartilic range [IQR]: 31.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (43.2%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 9 (24.3%) had systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, 4 (10.8%) had systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and 4 (10.8%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main reason for ICU admission was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> flare-up in 20 (54.0%) patients, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 12 (32.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median APACHE II at admission was 17 (IQR 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, 15 (40.5%) patients died, 10 (27%) during hospitalisation (7 in the ICU) and 5 after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with reduced long-term survival were: APACHE II score â‰¥18 (HR 6.02, 95% CI 1.76-20.62), age &lt;45 years (HR 6.54, 95% CI 1.84-23.29), presence of any previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease (HR 18.20, 95% CI 3.72-88.96), and increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy during ICU stay (HR 22.87, 95% CI 4.31-121.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term survival of patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> admitted to the ICU was related with age, higher APACHE II score, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, and an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> dose when comparing with previous ICU admissions </plain></SENT>
