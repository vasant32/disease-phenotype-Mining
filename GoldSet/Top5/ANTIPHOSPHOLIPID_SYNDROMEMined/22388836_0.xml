<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Along with the clinical symptoms and signs, serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have to be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APS can be primary, i.e., without any concomitant disorders, or secondary to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria for the diagnosis of APS have been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperacute APS (or catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>), often with a poor prognosis, must meet four criteria: involvement of three or more organs, rapid evolution of clinical manifestations, microangiopathic occlusion of small blood vessels at biopsy, and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rationale for apheresis treatment is the removal of pathogenetic antibodies involved in the development of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our experience includes 23 patients, in particular 15 women treated for 19 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the National Guidelines Program, the effectiveness of apheresis in catastrophic syndrome has a level of evidence of V/VI, with a strength of recommendation A; in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">highrisk pregnancy</z:e> it has a level of evidence of V with a strength of recommendation B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It will be necessary to better define the prognosis of various categories of pregnant patients with APS, as well as useful laboratory parameters to monitor its clinical course and anticipate any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
