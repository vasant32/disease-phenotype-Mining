<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study has evaluated its frequency in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency of FM in PAPS patients compared with healthy controls, to determine the possible associations between FM and PAPS features, and also to evaluate quality of life and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case-control study included 30 PAPS patients (by the Sapporo criteria) and 40 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data, drug use, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FM was diagnosed based on international criteria (ACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires on quality of life, including the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fibromyalgia</z:e> Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), were also applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAPS patients and controls were similar in mean age as well as in distributions of gender and Caucasian race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean disease duration was 5.4 ± 4.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> was made in five (16.7%) PAPS patients and no controls (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAPS patients had more diffuse pain (53% vs. 0%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001), ≥11 tender points (23% vs. 5%, respectively, p = 0.032), and a greater total number (175 vs. 57, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) as well as median number of tender points per patient than controls (5 [0-18] vs. 0 [0-11], respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PAPS patients had lower values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions of the SF-36, as well as higher FIQ scores, higher BDI scores, more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> diagnoses according to BDI results, and increased VAS in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of PAPS patients with FM compared with those subjects without FM revealed no significant differences regarding demographic features or thrombotic or clinical events; however, PAPS patients who also had FM had lower values in SF-36 dimensions as well as higher FIQ (82.6 ± 9.6 vs. 33.6 ± 29.8, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) and VAS scores (6.6 ± 2.97 vs. 3.25 ± 3.11, respectively, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BDI scores, in contrast, were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, one-fifth of PAPS patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> and a low quality of life when compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
