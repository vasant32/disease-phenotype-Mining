<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antibody-mediated disruption of the annexin A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> shield has been posited to be a thrombogenic mechanism in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38068">antimalarial</z:chebi> drug, hydroxychloroquine, dissociates antiphospholipid immune complexes and restores annexin A5 binding to planar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative immunoassays, we demonstrated similar effects on BeWo trophoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore, investigated the effects of the drug on localization of annexin A5 in primary cultures of human placental syncytiotrophoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Laser confocal microscopy with computer-based morphometric analysis was used to localize annexin A5 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on syncytiotrophoblasts exposed to polyclonal and monoclonal antiphospholipid and control immunoglobulin-Gs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine reversed the effects of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on the syncytiotrophoblasts by markedly reducing immunoglobulin-G binding and restoring annexin A5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results provide the first morphologic evidence for this effect of hydroxychloroquine on human placental syncytiotrophoblasts and support the possibility of novel treatments that target <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> binding </plain></SENT>
