<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To delineate the features and prevalence of the systemic and ophthalmic involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During an 18-month period, the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> who attended a clinic for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and hemostasis were reviewed on arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were then referred to a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> clinic and examined prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first 20 consecutive patients underwent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fluoroangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of the various organs affected by the disease was noted in the group, as well as the prevalence and type of ophthalmic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common forms of systemic involvement were fetal loss in 11 female patients (46%), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in 17 patients (44%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 16 patients (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic findings were as follows: 13 patients (33%) were symptomatic, and 12 of them complained of visual disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 10 (83%) of these 12 patients, the visual symptoms were transient, and 7 of them were nonocular in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pathologic signs on ophthalmic examination were found in 5 of the 39 patients (13%), two of whom had intraocular pathologic findings related to <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>, and these were in the form of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 patients who were either asymptomatic or had transient visual disturbances, pathologic ocular findings were detected in only 2 (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Routine <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fluoroangiography did not reveal any additional information that could not otherwise have been detected by funduscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement in <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Transient visual disturbances are common, although most of them are related to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system rather than ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pathologic ophthalmic findings are unlikely to be found in asymptomatic patients or in patients with transient visual disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Routine <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fluoroangiography performed on patients with <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> is unproductive </plain></SENT>
