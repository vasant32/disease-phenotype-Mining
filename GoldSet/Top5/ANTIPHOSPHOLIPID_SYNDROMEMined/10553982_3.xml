<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of the 5th International Congress of SLE that took place in Cancun, Mexico, on April 20-25, 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main topics presented at the conference are summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include new findings about the genetics of SLE due to fine mapping of the patients' genes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> mouse models, the nucleosome as a major autoantigen in SLE, serving as an immunogen for pathogenic T helper and B cells and contributing to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, abnormalities of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as a cause of SLE, and apoptotic mechanisms as a cause of autoimmunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other topics included the pathophysiologic role of anti-endothelial cell antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, the thrombotic diathesis associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, induction of endothelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and its regulation by the idiotypic network, the penetration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> to the cytoplasm and nucleus and the subsequent interaction with cellular organelles, and new aspects in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, including animal models of the disease and the importance of antibodies to beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advances in the clinical aspects of SLE included clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pregnancy and neonatal SLE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, hormones, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>Additionally, four "Lectures of A Lifetime," entitled (1) What causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) From natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>; (3) The idiotypic network and SLE; and (4) Late-stage morbidity and mortality in SLE-the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SLE, as well as hope for novel therapeutic modalities and diagnostic measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These offer the possibility of improving life quality and decreasing mortality from the disease and its complications </plain></SENT>
