<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to evaluate hematological findings in patients with SLE at the time of referral and their relationship with disease activity and organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was carried consecutive 115 patients, including 20 males and 85 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> at the time of presentation due to various etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease was seen in 46% and it was the most common encountered picture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> was 28%, and Coombs' positivity rate was 22% among our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> ( &lt; 4.0 x 10(9)/l), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> ( &lt; 1.8 x 10(9)/l), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> ( &lt; 1.5 x 10(9)/l) rates were 57, 20, and 82%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was seen in 40% for &lt; 150 x 10(9)/l, 26% for &lt; 100 x 10(9)/l, and 8% for &lt; 50 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased fibrinogen levels were observed in 35% without relating to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rates of C3 and C4 hypocomplementemia were 86 and 64%, respectively, and both are closely correlated with the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, C3 hypocomplementemia was more prominent in cases with renal or serosal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> were more common in patients with skin/mucosal involvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>C3 hypocomplementemia, APS and elevated IgG levels were more common in our patients with renal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SLE should be kept in mind while evaluating patients with mentioned hematological findings, especially in those with accompanying organ involvements </plain></SENT>
