<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the physiological function of beta2-GPI and its potential role in the pathophysiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, the binding of beta2-GPI to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes was characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction of beta2-GPI with unilamellar vesicles containing varying amounts of acidic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) was measured at equilibrium via relative light scattering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of binding isotherms gave apparent Kd values ranging from approximately 5.0 to 0.5 microM over a range of 5-20 mol % anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of binding by increasing ionic strength and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> ions suggests that binding is primarily electrostatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that beta2-GPI binding to membranes with physiological anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content is relatively weak in comparison to plasma coagulation proteins, suggesting that beta2-GPI does not function as a physiological <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> based on its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding properties </plain></SENT>
