<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we found IgG anti-thrombin Ab in some APS patients that could interfere with inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that activated coagulation factor X (FXa) is homologous to thrombin in the catalytic domains and is also regulated primarily by AT, we hypothesized that some thrombin-reactive Ab may bind to FXa and interfere with AT inactivation of FXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test these hypotheses, we studied reactivity of eight patient-derived monoclonal IgG antiphospholipid Ab with FXa and the presence of IgG anti-FXa Ab in APS patients and investigated the effects of FXa-reactive mAb on AT inactivation of FXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that six of six thrombin-reactive IgG mAb bound to FXa and that the levels of plasma IgG anti-FXa Ab in 38 APS patients were significantly higher than those in 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the mean plus 3 SDs of the 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was used as the cutoff, 5 of 38 APS patients (13.2%) had IgG anti-FXa Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, three of six FXa-reactive mAb significantly inhibited AT inactivation of FXa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined, these results indicate that anti-FXa Ab may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by interfering with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> function of AT on FXa in some APS patients </plain></SENT>
