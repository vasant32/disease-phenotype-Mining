<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients having had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, deficiencies of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> may occur frequently in patients with SLE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
