<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight women with primary APS and 30 age-and-sex-matched controls were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients presented higher-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> levels and lower-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels than controls </plain></SENT>
