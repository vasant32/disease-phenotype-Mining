<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis is controversial with some authors favoring an artifactual theory while others consider a reactive phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, only 41 cases of MICE have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe an additional case of MICE in a 24-year-old female with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mobile hyperechogenic mass attached to the left ventricular surface of the aortic valve was documented by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient did have cardiac catheterization one month before the cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination showed a lesion composed of histiocytes and mesothelial cells together with fibrin and scattered inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case of MICE detected in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
