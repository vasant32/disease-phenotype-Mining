<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether there is a relationship between low antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody levels and the obstetrical complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to analyze the impact of conventional APS treatment in patients with low aPL levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, we retrospectively reviewed the files of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients referred to our unit (2003-2010) for unexplained pregnancy morbidity, with an aPL test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared patients with APS confirmed by Sapporo criteria (Group 1) with patients with APS-like obstetrical complications with an aPL titer below the intermediate titer (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 57 patients were included (25 in Group 1; 32 in Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Obstetrical events were recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> &lt;10th week of gestation (n=9 patients in Group 1; n=13 patients in Group 2), fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n=11 and 16, respectively), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (n=5 in Group 1; n=6 in Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of obstetrical events per patient was very similar before APS treatment (3 [1-8] in Group 1; 3 [1-6] in Group 2) and decreased significantly after APS treatment to 0 [0-2] and 0 [0-2], respectively (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature births</z:hpo> and the characteristics of neonates were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, treatment of patients with low aPL levels and APS-like obstetrical events was associated with outcomes similar to those found in otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> or other adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, properly designed treatment trials would be required to prove the benefit of such treatments </plain></SENT>
