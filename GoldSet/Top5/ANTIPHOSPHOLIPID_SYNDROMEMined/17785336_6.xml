<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether beta2-GPI and similar proteins exist in rat and human brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No expression was found on Northern blot analysis of human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a standard procedure for the isolation of serum beta2-GPI we purified a 100 kD human brain protein, which was found by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> sequencing to have full homology with the serum protein, histidine-rich <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (HRGP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of HRGP in rat and human brain was established by RT-PCR studies and a partial sequence of rat brain HRGP was obtained showing 68% homology with the human protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG from most APS patients bound to HRGP, which shares distinct biochemical properties with beta2-GPI, is present in the brain and may be an important autoantigen </plain></SENT>
