<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incorrect diagnosis of APS may result in unnecessary long-term anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and serological characteristics of patients being treated for APS and concordance with published criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study identified APS patients who were being treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> at one of three university-based anticoagulation clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of anticardiolipin antibody were classified as low-positive if abnormal but &lt; 40 GPL/MPL units and medium/high-positive if &gt; or = 40 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strength of meeting Sapporo criteria was graded as definite, possible, and not meeting criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 103 cases, 97 had clinical and laboratory data available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 10 cases (10%, 95% Confidence Interval 5 - 19) met criteria for definite APS, 16 (16%, 10 - 26) had a possible diagnosis, and 71 (73%, 63 - 81) did not meet criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 70 cases that had abnormal anticardiolipin antibody results, only 32 (46%, 34 - 58) had medium/high-positive levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeat laboratory testing was performed in only 49 cases (51%, 40 - 61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that few patients treated forAPS met Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormal levels of anticardiolipin antibody were frequently in the low-positive range, and repeat testing was often absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A quality improvement program that includes review of cases referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> anticoagulation care is recommended to ensure appropriate testing and treatment of patients with suspected APS </plain></SENT>
