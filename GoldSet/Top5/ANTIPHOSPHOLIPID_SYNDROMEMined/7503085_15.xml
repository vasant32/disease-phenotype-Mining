<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the link between anticardiolipin antibodies and the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study conducted in a single center, 390 SLE patients were followed up between June 1991 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At each assessment, a complete history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation (including measurement of anticardiolipin antibodies) were performed according to a standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of the patients had an elevated level of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the univariate analysis, elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels were found to correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.006), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (aPTT) (P = 0.003), and positive direct and indirect Coombs' test result's (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was identified with any of the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, anticardiolipin antibodies remained highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 4.05, P = 0.02), positive direct Coombs' test (OR 2.31, P &lt; 0.001), and prolonged aPTT (OR 1.73, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate model using venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> as the outcome variable, only prolonged aPTT was associated with venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 7.9, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the laboratory variables were found to correlate with fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with SLE is associated with prolonged aPTT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and positive Coombs' test result, but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonged aPTT is strongly associated with venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
