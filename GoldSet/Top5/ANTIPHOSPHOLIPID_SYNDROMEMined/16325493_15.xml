<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated possible associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and various APS-related manifestations in a large group of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seven APS patients were retrospectively evaluated, 259 women and 48 men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had primary APS (PAPS) (n=173, 56.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APS was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in 104 patients (33.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent detailed medical interview and routine physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further data were obtained from patients' medical files regarding the expression of various clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 90 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (29.3%), the rate was significantly higher in SLE compared to PAPS patients (41.9% vs. 23.1%, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were found in male (29.2%) and female (29.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant associations were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and cardiac valves thickening and dysfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001209'>skin ulcerations</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rates of thrombotic episodes as well as obstetric complications were similar in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> may be a risk factor for cardiac, neurological, articular and cutaneous complications in APS </plain></SENT>
