<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated interactions between genetically and autoimmune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> by inducing experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (eAPS) in mice carrying the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: eAPS was induced in heterozygous and homozygous FVL transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) by immunization with β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody levels were measured at 1 and 5 months post-immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were tested at 4 months post-immunization for behavior and cognitive function in the staircase, elevated plus-maze, and swim T-maze tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains were removed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for inflammatory markers and neurodegenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single immunization with β2-GPI induced significantly higher and longer-lasting immune responses, and this was dependent on the number of FVL alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 5 months post-immunization, levels of antibodies rose from 1.17 ± 0.07 to 1.62 ± 0.17 (optical density units; ODU) in homozygous FVL mice, compared with stable levels of 0.59 ± 0.17 and 0.48 ± 0.16 ODU in heterozygous FVL mice and a drop from 1.62 ± 0.21 to 0.61 ± 0.13 ODU in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioral and cognitive clinical features of eAPS were also correlated with FVL allele load, as assessed by the elevated plus-maze (altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>), staircase (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and higher exploration), and swim T-maze (impaired learning) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological studies identified significant neurodegenerative changes in both grey and white matter in the eAPS-FVL brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In spite of the potential interaction of two prothrombotic <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, there were no ischemic lesions seen in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that genetically mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> increase the risk of developing coagulation-targeted <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp>, and suggest the importance of antibody-mediated neurodegenerative processes in the brain in APS </plain></SENT>
