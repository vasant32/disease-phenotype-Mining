<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate sexual function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients using the Brazilian version of the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven APS male patients (Sapporo criteria) were age and race-matched with 22 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data, drug use and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IIEF was also self-applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age (p = 0.114), frequency of Caucasian race (p = 1.00) and married status (p = 0.438) were similar in APS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean disease duration was 8.8 Â± 4.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>Erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> (ED) was frequently observed in APS versus controls (45.5 vs. 4.5%, p = 0.0096), especially moderate/severe ED (p = 0.0081) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total IIEF score (49.6 vs. 67.1, p = 0.019), erectile function (19.6 vs. 28.1, p = 0.005) and intercourse satisfaction (7.8 vs. 11.9, p = 0.009) were lower in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in orgasmic function (p = 0.114), sexual desire (p = 0.123) or overall satisfaction (p = 0.097) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison between APS patients with ED (n = 5) and without ED (n = 6) revealed more arterial events in APS with ED (100 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.0152), and also longer disease duration (12 [7-16] vs. 5.5 [2-13] years, p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A trend towards lower venous events (20 vs. 83.3%, p = 0.0801) and higher renal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (60% vs. 0, p = 0.0606) was observed in APS patients with ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical manifestations, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies positivity</z:hpo> were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this was the first study that demonstrated moderate/severe ED in almost 50% of cases of a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This alteration was linked to arterial events and longer disease duration </plain></SENT>
