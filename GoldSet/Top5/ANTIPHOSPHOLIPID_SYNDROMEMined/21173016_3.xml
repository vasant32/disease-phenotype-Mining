<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the thrombotic/proinflammatory tendency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic monocyte activation by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> involves numerous proteins and intracellular pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and immunoregulatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> have been aimed as a therapeutic tool in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study delineates the global effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> on the prothrombotic tendency of monocytes from APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 35 healthy donors were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS patients received 20 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> for 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained before the start, at the end and 2 months after the end of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 month of treatment, monocytes showed a significant inhibition of tissue factor, protein activator receptors 1 and 2, vascular endothelial growth factor and Flt1 expression that was related to the inhibition of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B/Rel DNA-binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteomic analysis showed proteins involved in thrombotic development (annexin II, RhoA and protein disulphide isomerase) with altered expression after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-vitro studies indicated that the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> reductase by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> might inhibit protein prenylation and MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data from this study support the belief that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> has multiple profound effects in monocyte activity, which might contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prevention in APS patients </plain></SENT>
