<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe monozygotic twins with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> with a dissimilar clinical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient was diagnosed to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> at 63 years old and was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She presented ulterior exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> requiring intravenous immunoglobulin and subsequent treatment with rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She ultimately had a favorable response without thrombotic events during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient who had a history of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> and endometrial <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> in complete remission was evaluated for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was diagnosed at the age of 63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was treated with steroids and had a favorable response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After few months she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> requiring anticoagulation therapy without hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and HLA DR4 (DRB1*04) and HLA DR5 (DRB1*12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of those two entities in monozygotic twins could support the presence of common predisposing genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, with both patients being genotipically identical, the clinical expression was different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those cases highlight the possibility that environmental factors may affect the expression of those disorders </plain></SENT>
