<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our cohort of positive LA patients was first identified in our outpatients population by the following sensitive LA-detecting tests: Rosner index, diluted prothrombin time (dPT) and Rosove index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the 227 consecutive LA-positive patients were tested for dRVVT with the same blood sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta(2)GPI) autoantibodies assays were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APS using Sapporo clinical criteria revised at Sydney, was found in 116 of these 227 consecutive LA-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of the different tests were analysed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using univariate analysis, dRVVT, dPT, IgG aCL and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies were significantly associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating-characteristics (ROC) curve defined the best cut-off value for dRVVT ratio at 1.61 with a good specificity (78%) and a lower sensitivity (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis using a binary logistic procedure, retained the dRVVT ratio (&gt; or = 1.61) and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies (&gt; 15 USG) as being associated with APS (p = 0.018; odds ratio [OR] 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.7, and p = 0.0001; OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.5-6.5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To conclude, these results agree with the need for LA criteria favouring specificity over sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of a threshold around 1.6 for dRVVT ratio should help discriminate APS from non-APS patients </plain></SENT>
