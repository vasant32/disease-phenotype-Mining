<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As concerns the relationship between anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>), it was investigated in only one coronary primary prevention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of anti-beta2-GPI in a well characterized group of patients with different clinical manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from 37 patients (mean age 62.7 +/- 9.9) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> (20 with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>-UA and 17 with effort <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>-EA) and from 40 healthy subjects, matched for age and sex, were tested for the presence of IgG and IgM anti-beta2-GPI using an ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven/37 patients (29.7%) resulted positive for anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positivity for IgG anti-beta2-GPI was found in 10 patients, 1 patient was positive for IgM and 1 for both isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-beta2-GPI in the control group resulted significantly lower (2.5%; p &lt; 0.005) than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positivity for anti-beta2-GPI was found in 9/20 (45%) patients with UA and only in 2/17 patients (11.8%) with EA (p = 0.0365) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2-GPI levels (median 7.7U/ml, range 2.6-24.1) were significantly higher in patients with UA compared to patients with EA (median 4.6 U/ml, range 2.3-11.5; p = 0.02) and controls (median 3.15 U/ml, range 2.3-9.0; p &lt; 0.0001); also IgM levels resulted higher in patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positivity for anti-beta2-GPI was observed in 4/13 patients (30.8%) with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and in 7/24 (29.2%) patients without a previous MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that anti-beta2-GPI could represent an expression of the T-cell activation detectable in patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lack of a significant difference in the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with or without a previous MI suggests that anti-beta2-GPI are not induced by tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
