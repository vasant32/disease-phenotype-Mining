<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> (and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>) may promote the formation of these complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes with autoantibodies to these complexes suggests an active pro-atherogenic role in vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies have been regarded as pro-atherogenic, whereas IgM antibodies are thought to be anti-atherogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this study, oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes, IgG, and IgM anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements were taken in two patient groups: (1) those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA); and (2) those with primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes, SLE and SSc patients had the highest mean optical densities (ODs) (P &lt;.001), followed by RA (P = .139) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibody distribution followed the same pattern observed with oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes, SLE and SSc (P &lt;.001), RA (P = .08), and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgM antibodies showed a reverse pattern, with the highest mean OD in RA (P &lt;.001), followed by SSc (P = .007) and SLE (P = 143) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies were significantly higher in secondary APS patients compared with SLE controls without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the highest mean OD and prevalence of IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies were observed in APS patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may reflect the widespread vascular involvement seen in SLE and SSc, in contrast to the relatively low vascular involvement in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In SLE and SSc, high serum levels and prevalence of circulating oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes and IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI antibodies indicate significant vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> as well as a possible pathogenic role in autoimmune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
