<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present herein a case of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> of a free rectus abdominal musculocutaneous flap used for reconstructive surgery of gingival <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> that could not be rescued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 54-year-old woman underwent the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had experienced two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> in her 20s, but medical history was otherwise uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively, the anastomosed artery often showed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and the flaps had become necrotic after bilateral flaps were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings, 7 days postoperatively, showed high levels of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This value normalized by 2 months postoperatively after using chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case does not match the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, but some English-language reports have shown rising <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> levels, particularly anticardiolipin antibodies, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those cases, levels have normalized after successful therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> levels should be examined before surgery to identify risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
