<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed mice with induced experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) for neurological and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After immunization with monoclonal human anticardiolipin antibody (H-3), female BALB/c mice developed elevated levels of circulating anti-negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (aPL), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI), and anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA), along with clinical manifestations of APS like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and fetus resorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS mice were impaired neurologically and performed several reflexes less accurately compared to the controls, including placing reflex (P &lt; 0.05), postural reflex (P &lt; 0.05), and grip test (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APS mice also exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactive behavior</z:hpo> in an open field, which tests spatial behavior (P &lt; 0.03), and displayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001405'>impaired motor coordination</z:mp> on a rotating bar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aPL in combination with abeta2GPI and AECA is probably involved in the neurological and behavioral defects shown in mice with experimental APS </plain></SENT>
