<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency, clinical, and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) or MS-like illnesses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSL</z:e>) among a large, prospectively followed cohort of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody (aPL)-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995 patients referred to a university-affiliated rheumatology clinic were prospectively evaluated for aPL based on questionnaires designed to detect aPL-related symptoms and/or a family history of aPL-related illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed when significant neurological features were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with MS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSL</z:e> was identified and their clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 322 patients evaluated for aPL-related symptoms or events, 189 (59%) were positive for at least one class of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 322 patients (8%) carried a diagnosis of MS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSL</z:e>, either at the initial evaluation or during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the 26 individuals (88%) tested positive for aPL, while the remaining 3 (11%) tested repeatedly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 23 patients (78%) had either more than one class of aPL or had multiple positive titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgM aCL was noted in 18 of the 23 patients (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonal bands were noted in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA) and low complement levels were frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blinded MRI readings showed lesions consistent with MS in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 7 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e> (TM), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (ON) was present in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients had either occult symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> or contributory family histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None had a defined underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective-tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A substantial number of aPL-positive patients have a concurrent diagnosis of MS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSL</z:e>, frequently presenting with elevated IgM aCL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) should be strongly considered as an alternative diagnosis to MS in these patients </plain></SENT>
