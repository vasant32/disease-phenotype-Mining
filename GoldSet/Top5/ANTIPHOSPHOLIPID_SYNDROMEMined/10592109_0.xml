<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of the autoepitope(s) of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I to be exposed by binding a short-chain (6-carbon), anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe our studies of the hololipoprotein generated by reacting beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I with dicaproyl phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The formation of the complex is accompanied by inhibition of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-coated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> surfaces, with 50% reduction in binding occurring at about 10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At concentrations &gt;10 mM, dicaproyl phosphatidylserine also displaces beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I bound to anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physicochemical studies suggest that at DCPS concentrations &gt;6 mM, the solutions are colloidal and that beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I forms a supramolecular complex with organized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a standard human autoimmune anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I plasma, as well as a series of six additional sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, the complex did not generate a detectable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> binding, per se, is not sufficient for the presentation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I or its recognition by autoantibodies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
