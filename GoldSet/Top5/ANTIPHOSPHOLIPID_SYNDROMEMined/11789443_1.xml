<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed increased signal intensities in T2- and diffusion-weighted images, especially in the temporal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with reversible symmetrical signal abnormalities of the insular cortex after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frontal paramedian cortex and the central region were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, suggesting an intact blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon follow-up examination 12 days later, the signal abnormalities resolved completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reversible hyperintensities on T2-weighted images are due to different causes leading to increased water content, such as demyelinisation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to published data, cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> caused by excessive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration and other noxious substances is assumed to be the most probable cause for these findings </plain></SENT>
