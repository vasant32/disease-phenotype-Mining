<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure the accuracy of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in identifying a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with SLE or PAPS who attended our rheumatology clinic between April 1992 and March 1994 were included in a retrospective analysis of the relationship between thrombotic events and aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aCL measurements were performed in the same laboratory by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, blinded as to the presence or absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL was quantified by means of the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) for each isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratum-specific likelihood ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to define strata with optimal discriminant power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the period of study, aCL was measured in 117 patients (113 SLE and 4 PAPS), of whom 24 (20.5%) had experienced thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROC AUC +/- the standard error for IgG aCL was 0.81 +/- 0.05, signifying an 81% accuracy in the identification of a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the accuracy of the IgM and IgA aCL was significantly lower (0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.54 +/- 0.07, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using stratum-specific likelihood ratios, we defined three strata in the IgG aCL scale that discriminate between patients with low, indeterminate, and high probabilities of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For IgG aCL levels below 21.4 IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (GPL) U/mL, the posttest probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 0.07, whereas for IgG aCL levels &gt; or = 65.1 GPL U/mL, the posttest probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 0.75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For IgG aCL values between 21.4 and 65.0 GPL U/mL, the probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 0.20, equivalent to the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IgG aCL determinations perform well in the identification of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE or PAPS, while the IgM and IgA aCL have poor diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for management of these patients </plain></SENT>
