<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PVT has been related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, hemodynamic factors, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PVT has been reported in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> without liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to find the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi>) and coagulation inhibitors in PVT in patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a case-controlled study, matched by age, liver function, and etiology, to discover the role of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein activity in PVT in cirrhotic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied 30 cirrhotic patients: 6 of 10 (60%) patients with PVT were <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-positive, whereas only 2 of 20 (10%) in the cirrhotic control group were <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-positive (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low serum levels of protein C, protein S antithrombin III, and plasminogen were found in cirrhotic patients; and, no differences were found between patients with and without PVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower protein S and antithrombin III levels were found in patients with Child-Pugh class C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> were related to PVT in cirrhotic patients; but, a lower concentration of coagulation inhibitors was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
