<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the etiology of recurrent cerebrovascular events (CVE) in <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected information on recurrent CVE in 308 patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and sought to determine concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causes that had emerged or been newly detected since the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-eight patients received aspirin (48%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (2%), or oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (50%; medical group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty patients underwent percutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure (closure group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at index event was 50 years (SD 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 33% of patients, the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was preceded by at least 1 CVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 8.7Â±4.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 32 recurrent CVE (13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) occurred in the medical and 16 recurrent CVE (8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) in the closure group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concurrent etiologies were identified for 12 recurrent CVE in the medical group (38%): large artery disease (9%), small artery disease (6%), cardioembolism (13%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005318'>cerebral vasculitis</z:hpo> (3%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo>-syndrome (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the closure group, 7 recurrent CVE had a concurrent etiology (44%): large artery disease (6%), small artery disease (19%), cardioembolism (13%), and thrombophilic disorder (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of concurrent etiologies did not differ between patients with recurrent CVE under medical treatment and those undergoing <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure (P=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent etiologies are identified for more than one third of recurrent ischemic events in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, casting doubt on the sole causal role of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
