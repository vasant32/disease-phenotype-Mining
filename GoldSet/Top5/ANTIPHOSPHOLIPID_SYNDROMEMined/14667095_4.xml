<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 71 consecutive SLE patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, history, clinical and laboratory evaluations, as well as trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the original population, so patients were followed up for a mean time of 5.80 +/- 1.53 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a mean period of 5.39 +/- 1.42 years; 40 patients underwent a repeat TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous ICVA history was present at baseline in 16 patients (22.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 13 (81.2%) had evidence of LHVAs on TTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous ICVAs were significantly associated to diagnosis of secondary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (SAPS), positivity for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCl), and LHVAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed the correlation between previous ICVAs and LHVAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LHVAs were not more commonly observed in patients with SAPS compared to patients without SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, irrespective of any differences in antithrombotic treatment, ICVAs had occurred in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, ICVAs had recurred in seven patients, while a first event <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> occurred in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between ICVAs and LHVAs, and a trend towards a positive correlation of the former with SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that LHVAs represent a compelling risk factor for the development of ICVAs in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conversely, SAPS and aCl positivity, although associated with ICVAs, did not clearly correlate with LHVAs in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results provide insight on the pathogenesis of ICVAs and may give clues on the potential efficacy of preventive/therapeutic strategies in different SLE subpopulations </plain></SENT>
