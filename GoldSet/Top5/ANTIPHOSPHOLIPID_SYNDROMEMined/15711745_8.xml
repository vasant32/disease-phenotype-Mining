<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical significance of aPT and aPS-PT by testing for the presence of these antibodies in 212 SLE patients and in 100 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results show that anti-prothrombin antibodies were found in 47% of the patients (aPT in 31% and aPS-PT in 31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their presence did not correlate with that of aCL, anti-beta2GPI, LA and/or anti-protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG but not IgM aPT were more frequently found in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM aPS-PT were also more frequent in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (venous and/or arterial) than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgG aPT and IgG and IgM aPS-PT were higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although aPT and aPS-PT were more frequently found in women with adverse obstetric history than in those without, the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More significantly, 48% of the patients with aPL-related clinical features who were negative for standard tests had antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that aPT and aPS-PT are frequently found in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their presence is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, making these antibodies potential markers for the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing for these antibodies could be of clinical benefit in patients who are negative for the routinely used tests </plain></SENT>
