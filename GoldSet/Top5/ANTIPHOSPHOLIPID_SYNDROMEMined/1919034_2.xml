<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many laboratories have established ELISAs for the the routine detection of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies had indicated that assay incubation at 37 degrees C may interfere with the antigen binding capacity of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reexamined this phenomenon by comparing ACA titers obtained when incubations are performed at either 37 degrees C or at room temperature (RT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of coating antigen in aqueous or organic solution was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sera tested included a set of recognized ACA standards and samples from 19 patients with SLE, two with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, 71 patients with a variety of autoimmune and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and 210 blood bank controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that while some sera do perform better under either incubation temperature there was no correlation between ACA titers and incubation temperature on a population basis either for IgG or IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was seen both for positive standards and patient sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For IgG ACA a similar phenomenon was seen if the microplates were coated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> either in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="29377">sodium carbonate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For IgM ACA there was a significant increase in ACA titers at RT when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was coated in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that for most sera neither the antigen coating medium nor the assay incubation temperature are important variables in the determination of IgG ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors contributing to the influence of either variable in individual sera could not be identified </plain></SENT>
