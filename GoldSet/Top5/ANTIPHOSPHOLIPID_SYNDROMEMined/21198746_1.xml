<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> (TAI) is associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> in euthyroid women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An electronic search was conducted using the databases Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library, from inception to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of the studies on the association between TAI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The odd ratios of case-control studies and relative risks of cohort studies were pooled respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The software Review Manager (version 4.3.1) was applied for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search strategy identified 53 potentially relevant publications, 22 of which were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A clear association between thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> was observed with a pooled odds ratio of 2·55 (95% CI 1·42-4·57, P=0·002) in eight case-control studies and a pooled relative risk of 2·31 (95% CI 1·90-2·82, P&lt;0·000 01) in 14 cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women with TAI were found to have slightly higher age [age difference, 1·29 years] (95% CI 0·43-2·16, P=0·003) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [TSH difference, 0·61 mIU/l] (95% CI 0·51-0·71, P&lt;0·000 01) compared with those without TAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the currently available evidence, it appears that the presence of thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> in euthyroid women </plain></SENT>
