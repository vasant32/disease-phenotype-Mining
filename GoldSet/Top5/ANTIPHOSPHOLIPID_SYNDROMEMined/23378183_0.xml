<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated relationships between aPLs and THE in 458 patients suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>THEs were observed in 232 of 458 patients, including 148 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 59 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, 18 of microthrombosis, and 20 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of aPL is an indicator for high risk of THE in patients in whom THE was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of THE in aPL-positive patients varied among patients with different underlying diseases </plain></SENT>
