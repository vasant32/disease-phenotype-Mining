<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with periodontopathic bacteria may enhance <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> through molecular mimicry with TLRVYK <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on beta-2 glycoprotein I, a target molecule in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> on TPL and PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-five pregnant women (47 TPL and 48 healthy subjects) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Periodontal clinical parameters and periodontopathic bacteria were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular mimicry between TLRVYK <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and homologous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on the periodontopathic bacteria was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the respective <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (SIRVYK on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, TLRIYT on Porphyromonus gingivalis, and TLALYK on Treponema denticola) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, anti-TLRVYK and anti-SIRVYK IgG antibodies were measured using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the rabbit antibodies specific for the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> homologous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, only anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody reacted with TLRVYK <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody was significantly associated with diagnosis of TPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 95 births, 14 (14.7 %) delivered preterm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preterm birth rate was higher in the anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody &gt;median group than in the ≤median group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 47 TPL subjects 13 had PB, and ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that past smoking, presence of P. gingivalis and anti-SIRVYK IgG antibody were significantly correlated with PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> with P. gingivalis and the antibody response to SIRVYK might be associated with TPL and PB </plain></SENT>
