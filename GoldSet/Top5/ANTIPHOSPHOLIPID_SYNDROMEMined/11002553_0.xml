<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to some reports, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly improves live birth rates in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the work is an evaluation of the results of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in pregnant women with elevated titres of ACA and/or <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> in blood and bad obstetric anamnesis, or after <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our material consisted of three groups: the first one was composed of 25 ACA- and/or <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>-seropositive pregnant women 30.0 +/- 4.1 years old with 1-5 early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> in past, the second one of six seropositive patients 31.3 +/- 2.8 years old, actually pregnant after the treatment of unexplained <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> (two of them after assisted reproduction) and, finally, in the third group were placed five pregnant ACA- and <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>-seronegative pregnant women 30.8 +/- 2.2 years old with 2-4 abortions of unexplained etiology in past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ACA IgA, IgM and IgG and <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> IgG levels in blood sera were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a positive titre ACA in the class IgA was considered &gt; 7 APL/ml, in the class IgM &gt; 4 MPL/ml, IgG &gt; 7 GPL/ml and in case of <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> IgG &gt; 25 GPL/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 7500-30,000 units daily during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the pregnancy under the control of kaolin-kephalin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first group, where 53 pregnancies from 56 were miscarried (94.6%), after the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in 10 women 9 pregnancies of 11 (81.8%) were terminated by live birth (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the patients died three days after cesarean section because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, probably due to sudden stopping of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second group three women after <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment delivered live babies, but three untreated aborted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the last group only two women treated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> delivered live babies and three, despite treatment, miscarried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It should be concluded, that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in ACA- and/or <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>-positive pregnant women might be a recommended therapeutic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> a special precaution should be undertaken, when stopping the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It seems, that double assay of ACA and <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> in patients with conception troubles might be usefull </plain></SENT>
