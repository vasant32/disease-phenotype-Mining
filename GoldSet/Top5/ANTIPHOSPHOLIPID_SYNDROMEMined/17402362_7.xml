<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven percent of patients were positive for HPIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma from 40 of the 72 patients (seven positive and 33 negative), was also tested with the other available HPIA ELISA (GTI) kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were positive with both ELISA kits, two were highly positive only with Asserachrom HPIA and four only with GTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the positive patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients have never received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between HPIA presence and patients' age, sex, aPL levels or presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in HPIA presence was observed in patients with primary APS, secondary APS or aPL without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a poor correlation between the two commercial ELISA showing that, on the same blood sample, a patient could be highly positive with one technique and negative with the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-dependant enzyme-linked immunoassay, which is often the first test used for the diagnosis of HIT, should be interpreted cautiously in patients with aPL since there is a danger of overdiagnosis and overtreatment </plain></SENT>
