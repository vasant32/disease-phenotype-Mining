<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the indications, methods, and outcomes of tertiary surgery in patients with a failed autologous breast reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent breast reconstruction with autologous tissue performed by the senior author (M.H.) between 2002 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis was made to evaluate the first reconstruction performed, causes of failure, indications for tertiary reconstruction, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A preoperative hematologic workout was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients who were classified within the highest group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, specific prophylactic measurements were taken for the tertiary surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 688 patients who underwent autologous breast reconstruction, a total of 14 patients required tertiary breast reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> was found in three patients resulting from disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positivity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (43 percent) underwent a combination of local skin flaps and/or implant reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (57 percent) underwent nine microvascular breast reconstructions: five superior gluteal artery perforator flaps, three transverse myocutaneous gracilis flaps, and one deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of nine flaps (22 percent) required quaternary reconstructions because of a failure of the second free flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional corrections such as revision lipofilling, scar revision, contralateral breast shaping, implant change, and capsulotomies were performed in 92.7 percent of the patients, with a mean follow-up of 37 months (range, 6 months to 7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tertiary surgery after autologous breast reconstruction failure has limited options and further reoperations are often needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Careful patient history and selective blood tests may reveal hidden <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When a second free flap is planned, primary and secondary antithrombotic therapy should be considered </plain></SENT>
