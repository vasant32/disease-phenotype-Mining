<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the neurodegenerative pathological processes underlying APS by inducing APS in a transgenic animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female C57B6/SJL mice carrying the APP(695)SWE mutation (Tg2576) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) controls were immunized with β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (APS mice) or adjuvant alone (controls) at 4 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 8 months the APP-APS mice developed high levels of aPL associated with motor <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> in a staircase test (p&lt;0.03 by t-test) and impaired performance in the cognitive T-maze (p&lt;0.02 for main effect of treatment by repeated measures ANOVA) relative to APP-CFA mice and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>wt-APS and wt-control did not differ significantly in their behavior or cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological studies revealed mature plaques only in the APP-APS group which also had higher amyloid load and number of activated microglia compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate a significant interaction between APP genotype and the induction of APS on a female background </plain></SENT>
