<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, analytic, and descriptive case of study is presented about of the obstetrics outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and pregnancy attended in Hospital General de Mexico Obstetrics and Gynecology Service from June, 2000 to February, 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent maternal complications were the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disorders</z:e> in association with pregnancy (27.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HELLP">HELLP syndrome</z:e> I and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, she died in puerperium period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main resolution of pregnancy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks (range of 24-40 weeks), and the mean birth weight was 2,389 g, median Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes of life respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 19 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> at birth and 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The maternal-fetal morbid-mortality rates decrease when no lupic disease activity is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the pregnancy stage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> grow in number as observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pregnancies should still be considered high risk and be managed with a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Co-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is the poorer prognosis for pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
