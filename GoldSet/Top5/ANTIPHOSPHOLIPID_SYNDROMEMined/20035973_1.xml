<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may exert direct effects on the placental trophoblast, independently of its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prevents complement activation in vivo and protects mice from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibition of the classical complement activation pathway by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was analyzed by means of in vitro assays and in pregnant women receiving prophylaxis with therapeutic doses (40 mg/day) of subcutaneous low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> by haemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (CH(50) assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The specific interaction between low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and the C1q subunit of the C1 complex of the complement cascade allowed the isolation of a small subpopulation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> ( 8.03+/-1.20 microg %), with an anti-activated factor X activity more than four times greater than the starting material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This subpopulation could be responsible for the in vitro inhibition of the classical complement activation pathway evaluated by the total haemolysis of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 60 microg/ml of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was needed to achieve 50% of haemolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of the classical complement pathway inhibition in pregnant women treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> required a first activation with aggregated human IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the interaction between low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and C1q could be relevant not only in the complement-dependent, but also in the complement-independent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> mechanisms responsible for the prevention of pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
