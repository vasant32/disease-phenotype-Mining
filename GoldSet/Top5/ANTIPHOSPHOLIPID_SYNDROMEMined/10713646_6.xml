<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with either PM (polymytosis) or DM (dermatomytosis) who were treated in the Rheumatology Unit, Sheba Medical Center, were followed-up in the past 8 years for the appearance of a clinical manifestation of the APS, and conversely, patients with APS treated by us were clinically assessed for the presence of signs and symptoms of PM and DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both conditions were diagnosed according to accepted diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients were found to have both APS and PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A patient with PM had transverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, a patient with DM had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, and a patient with PM had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients with PM had also SLE (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic lupus erythematosis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APS can be associated with a wide range of diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future data would reveal which therapy is the best for the association of PM/DM with APS, and determine the pathogenesis and prognosis in patients with this association </plain></SENT>
