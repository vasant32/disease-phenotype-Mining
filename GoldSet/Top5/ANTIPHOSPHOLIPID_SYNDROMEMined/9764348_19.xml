<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: A case-control study was conducted in three phases, spanning a 4-year period, in a multicenter clinical research environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six hundred eighty-seven <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>+ women, who were younger than 40 years and who each, completed up to three consecutive IVF/embryo transfer cycles within a 12-month period, were given either H/A alone or H/A in combination with IVIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Birthrates relative to the type of immunotherapy (i.e., H/A alone and H/A with IVIg) and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> profile were the main outcome measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In phase I, 687 women who tested <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>+ to one or more PL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> underwent two or fewer IVF attempts for a total of 1050 IVF cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four hundred seventy-seven (46%) births occurred in 923 IVF cycles in which H/A alone was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (17%) births occurred after 127 IVF cycles in which H/A was not administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In phase II, 322 of 687 women tested positive for a single <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These subjects underwent up to two consecutive IVF attempts for a total of 521 IVF cycles while receiving H/A alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The birthrate was significantly lower for women whose <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> were directed toward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE) or phosphatidylserine (PS) involving IgG or IgM isotypes than for women who had any other <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> (17% vs. 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In phase III, 121 women who did not achieve live births after two consecutive IVF attempts in which H/A alone was administered received IVIg in combination with H/A during their third consecutive IVF cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The birth rate was 41% after these IVF cycles when anti-PS or anti-PE involving IgG or IgM isotypes were present, as compared with 17% when H/A alone was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The IVF outcome did not improve when IVIg was administered in association with any other single <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>+ women with H/A alone improves IVF birthrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This benefit is selective in that it does not apply in cases in which IgG- or IgM-related <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> are directed against PE or PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In such cases, the addition of IVIg significantly improves the outcome </plain></SENT>
