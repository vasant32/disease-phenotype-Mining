<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize these antibodies, we attempted to isolate human monoclonal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B-cells of patients with at least one positive test for antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine, beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant were immortalized by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus and screened for production of specific IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive pools were fused with a heteromyeloma cell line and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-secreting clones were isolated by standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B from a 51-year-old man with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and recurrent cerebral microinfarctions, and RR-7F from a 48-year-old women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> but no evidence for thrombotic events were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B is of the IgG2 subtype with lambda light chains, while RR-7F is IgG2 with kappa light chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both monoclonals show reactivity against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine but lack reactivity against beta2-GPI or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To yield the same OD in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine ELISAs RR-7F must be used in an approximately 10-fold higher concentration than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B, indicating a lower affinity towards these antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both mAPA can bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the absence of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They do not cross-react with dsDNA but show reactivity against oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the heavy chain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B and RR-7F showed that both are members of the VH3 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B shows extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the CDR1 and 2 regions, indicating that it was derived by a T cell-dependent antigen driven process, RR-7F is apparently germline encoded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The two monoclonal <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> can be used as tools in further structural and functional analyses </plain></SENT>
