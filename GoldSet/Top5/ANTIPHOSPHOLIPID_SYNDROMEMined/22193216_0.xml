<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>What is the exact predictive value of these two antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>Is it really necessary to apply the criteria of APS to each patient just for the purpose of prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study is to reevaluate the predictive value of different combination of ACL and anti-β2GP1 antibody for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> formation in Chinese patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients fulfilling the 1997 ACR classification criteria for SLE were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was confirmed by ultrasound, cerebral MRI, computed tomography pulmonary angiogram and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both IgG and IgM isotype of ACL and anti-β2GP1 antibody were detected with ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ROC curves and other parameters of diagnostic test for different combination of ACL and anti-β2GP1 were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>175 patients were recruited and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 95.9% had been treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> before detection of the two antibodies, 44.9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 53.1% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ACL was positive in 28 patients (16%), and anti-β2GP1 antibody was positive in 21 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of a low or higher titer of either ACL (&gt;12 RU/ml) or anti-β2GP1 antibody (&gt;20 RU/ml) once has the highest predictive accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, the specificity, the Youden's index and the area under ROC curve are 61.11%, 81.11%, 0.4222 and 0.711 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A transient low or higher titer of ACL or anti-β2GP1 antibody had a good predictive value for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with SLE, especially in those with other traditional risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and those treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
