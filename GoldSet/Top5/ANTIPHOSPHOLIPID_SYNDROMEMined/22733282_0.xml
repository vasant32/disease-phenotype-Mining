<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present successful management of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS), using CT coronary angiography (CTCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> may be changed for APS if ACS was thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As coronary angiography is thought to be very dangerous for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, noninvasive CTCA was desirable for our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since no occlusion or narrowing was observed in CTCA, she has been safely treated as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> throughout the course without antiplatelet or antithrombin therapy </plain></SENT>
