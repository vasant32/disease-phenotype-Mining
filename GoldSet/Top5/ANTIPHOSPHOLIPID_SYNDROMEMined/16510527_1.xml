<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 353 individuals who had been tested for aCL on at least two occasions were tested for abeta2GPI and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups were defined: aCL-persistent, who tested aCL-positive on at least two occasions, and aCL non-persistent, who tested aCL-positive on fewer than two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions were performed using LA/abeta2GPI, LA and abeta2GPI as outcome variables and the percentage of aCL-positive tests as the predictor variable, adjusted for age, gender, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), smoking and number of venous (VT) and arterial thromboses (AT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight (19%) individuals were aCL persistent and 285 (81%) were aCL non-persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA/abeta2GPI was found in 36 (53%) of the aCL persistent group and 38 (13%) of the aCL non-persistent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups were similar for age, gender and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, SLE, VT and AT were more frequent in the aCL persistent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses revealed that odds ratios for LA/abeta2GPI, LA and abeta2GPI were 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-1.47], 1.36 (95% CI = 1.24-1.50) and 1.47 (95% CI = 1.31-1.65) respectively for each 10% increase in aCL-positive tests vs 0% positive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Persistence of aCL positivity is associated with an increased risk of LA/abeta2GPI </plain></SENT>
