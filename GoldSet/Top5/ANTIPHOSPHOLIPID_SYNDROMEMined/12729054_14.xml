<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed the data of 1519 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (APLA) positive patients between 1986 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them 637 were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) based on the 1999 preliminary classification criteria, while 704 patients had no clinical signs of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the autoantibody profile and clinical characteristics of primary and secondary APS, moreover to evaluate the associations between different APLA and specific symptoms attributable to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our results, the APLA profiles for primary and SLE-associated secondary APS were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the evaluated clinical symptoms, cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found to be more frequent in the SLE-associated, than in the primary APS group (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified important differences in the clinical profile of patient populations with various types of APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in subjects withlupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), than in those with IgG or IgM type ACLA (P &lt; 0.0001), while coronary, carotid and peripheral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred more often in subjects with IgG or IgM ACLA (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may support the role of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or its cofactor, beta2glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) in the initiation and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was detected in larger proportion of LA or IgG ACLA-positive patients compared with to IgM ACLA-positive subjects, while the occurrence of foetal loss was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
