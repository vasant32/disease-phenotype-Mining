<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies was examined by using the respective ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LA was positive in 38.6% of patients with DVT/PE, suggesting that LA is one of the most important risk factors in DVT/PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of anti-beta(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) IgG was in CT and SLE, followed by DVT, and none in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and healthy volunteers (control, n = 40), suggesting that it is related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of anti-prothrombin (aPT) IgG antibody was in DVT, followed by CT and SLE, and none in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and the control, suggesting that it is related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) IgG was in DVT, CT, and SLE, but 0% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, aPL IgM, anti-annexin V IgG, and anti-annexin V IgM were positive in patients both with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, suggesting that they are not related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that among the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, LA is the most sensitive marker for APS while anti-beta(2)GPI IgG, aPT IgG, and aPL IgG are risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, aPT IgG is a significant marker for DVT/PE </plain></SENT>
