<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 10 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and 3 monoclonal anti-beta2-GPI antibodies established from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, were assayed for binding to solid phase beta2-GPI on 20 commercially available plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several commercially available EIA plates were found to be of potential value for the measurement of anti-beta2-GPI autoantibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some plates were unsuitable for anti-beta2-GPI detection, possibly due to less beta2-GPI on the plates, or to differences in the nature of conformational changes of beta2-GPI induced by the plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differences among EIA plates need to be considered when measuring beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
