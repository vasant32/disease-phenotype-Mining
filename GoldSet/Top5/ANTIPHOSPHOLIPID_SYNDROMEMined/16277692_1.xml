<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We showed previously that nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar phosphoprotein, is recognized by sera from (NZW x BXSB)F1 (WB) mice, a model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we analysed the prevalence and kinetics of anti-NPM autoantibodies in WB mice by a solid-phase ELISA with recombinant human (rh) NPM as the antigen and showed that most male WB mouse sera had anti-NPM antibodies that were responsible for their indirect immunofluorescence staining pattern on Hep-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-NPM antibodies were significantly associated with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This antibody profile mirrored that observed in certain human SLE sera because anti-NPM antibodies were detected in 28% of the sera from patients with SLE and were similarly associated with aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that rhNPM bound to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) in vitro and increased the CL-binding activity of a WB-derived aCL monoclonal antibody indicates that NPM can interact with CL to form SLE-related immunogenic particles that might be responsible for the concomitant production of anti-NPM and aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
