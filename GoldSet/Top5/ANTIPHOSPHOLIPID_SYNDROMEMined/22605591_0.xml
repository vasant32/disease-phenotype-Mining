<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The international therapeutic guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> indefinitely after the first thrombotic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, therapeutic guidelines lack for a minority group of patients - the patients appropriately anticoagulated with recurrent thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors present a clinical report that reveals the therapeutic and diagnostic complexity of this specific group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding recent studies, APS has been revealed as a complex syndrome with multiple pathophysiological mechanisms previously unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this context, new therapeutic approaches have been defended and empirically experienced, with potentially promising results </plain></SENT>
