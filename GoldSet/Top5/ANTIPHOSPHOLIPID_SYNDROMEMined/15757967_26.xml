<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of preclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and associated risk factors in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We consecutively studied 70 SLE patients and 25 primary APS patients without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group included 40 healthy women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid ultrasound was performed and the intima-media wall thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and presence of plaque was investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Traditional vascular risk factors and SLE-disease and treatment related factors were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SLE patients had a higher prevalence of traditional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.005) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) and higher levels of total cholesterol (P = 0.03), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P = 0.004) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of carotid plaque was higher and appeared earlier in SLE patients than in the primary APS patients or controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was similar in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with secondary APS had a higher prevalence of carotid plaque than patients with primary APS (37.5% vs 8%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of plaque in SLE patients was associated with a higher SLICC score (2.40 +/- 1.78 vs 1.02 +/- 1.18, P = 0.002), higher ECLAM score (3.10 +/- 2.32 vs 1.84 +/- 1.59, P = 0.02) and older age (47.3 +/- 8.44 vs 37.38 +/- 11.28, P = 0.003) at the time of carotid ultrasound study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plaque prevalence in patients with primary APS is similar to that of controls and inferior to that of SLE patients with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SLE patients have a high prevalence of early carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> that is associated with cumulative disease damage and disease activity </plain></SENT>
