<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other IgC aCL from PAPS depend on beta 2GP-I for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied heat-unmasked aCL from 22 PAPS sera and from eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL were detected in standard (using new born calf serum [NBCS] that contains beta 2GP-I as blocking agent and to dilute samples) and in a modified ELISA (using beta 2GP-I-free-bovine serum albumin instead of NBCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overt and heat-unmasked IgC aCL were purified from CL micelles alone or mixed with purified beta 2GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NHS had no overt IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, aCL titers increased almost ten-fold after heat-inactivation of NHS, a result which was equally detectable in both assay conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, PAPS patients had one population of overt beta 2GP-I-dependent IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After heat-treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PAPS sera, we detected IgG aCL in both standard and modified aCL ELISA with an approximately three-fold increase in IgG aCL titers when tested in the standard assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two PAPS patients also had a second population of beta 2GP-I-independent overt IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Purified IgG from these PAPS sera retained both reactivities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
