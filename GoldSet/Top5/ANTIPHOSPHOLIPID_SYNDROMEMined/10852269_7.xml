<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We serially tested for aCL in a standardized fashion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> who were outpatients and gave consent to enter this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six had diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and 27 had limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three (4.8%) were positive for aCL, of whom 2 had limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only one patient aCL may have been clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This woman had limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> for years and had medium vessel occlusive disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> eventually requiring midfoot <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She did not have features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or other overlap conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 2 patients had no manifestations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: aCL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> rarely manifest clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The range of frequency of positive aCL in the literature is from 0 to 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From our study and the literature, we cannot ascertain if the prevalence is different in limited and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
