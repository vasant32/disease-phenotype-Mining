<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) is essential to diagnose the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three assays are available to detect the presence of these autoantibodies, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three assays suffer from several important drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, the assays lack standardization because the results of the assay partially depend on the laboratory that performs the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, we do not know whether the assays detect the autoantibody population responsible for the clinical manifestations that characterize the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the assays do not predict the risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is an absolute need for novel assays that generate prognostic information that can be used for a more tailored treatment of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2011, important information became available on the protein against which the autoantibodies are directed, β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the progress we have made in our understanding of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of β2GPI, it should be possible to design assays that can better predict the consequences of the presence of aPL in the circulation </plain></SENT>
