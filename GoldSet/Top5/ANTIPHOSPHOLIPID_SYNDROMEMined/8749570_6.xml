<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 140 patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera were examined for IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies were detected in 21 of 140 patients (15%) and remained positive from 4 to 98 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher incidences of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, intrauterine fetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), prolonged APTT, BFP-STS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> were found in SLE patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significantly lower incidences of malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> and serositis were found in SLE patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies, and the majority of these patients satisfied four or five of the revised criteria items of the American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatism</z:e> Association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were not observed when we compared clinical manifestations in anticardiolipin antibody-positive patients with those in antibody-negative patients by conventional ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that SLE patients with IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies show an unique form of SLE </plain></SENT>
