<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on eicosanoid production by human decidual cells and the in vitro interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and secretory phospholipase A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cultures of human decidual cells from early pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> decidual specimens were obtained from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of the Catholic University, Rome, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Patients were undergoing operative laparoscopy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032987" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extrauterine pregnancy</z:e>, with a period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000141'>amenorrhea</z:hpo> ranging from 6 to 9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Decidual samples were collected at laparoscopy by routine uterine curettage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Decidual cells were incubated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> [PG] E2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15553">PGF2alpha</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi>) were assayed by RIA after 24 hours of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro interactions between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and secretory phospholipase A2 were investigated with use of a modified ELISA for phospholipase A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> reduced eicosanoid release from decidual cells in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro assays showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> bound secretory phospholipase A2 and that a competition occurred between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and secretory phospholipase A2 for the common substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): In light of the critical role played by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23899">eicosanoids</z:chebi> in decidual function, we suggest that an interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and secretory phospholipase A2 occurring in vivo might impair important cellular communications at the decidual level in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
