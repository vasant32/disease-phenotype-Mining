<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, anticardiolipin antibodies have been described in the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected patients were studied to assess the influence of risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> and of the stage of HIV-1 infection on the prevalence of IgG-ACA in HIV-seropositive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided in two groups, one composed of 38 asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals and the other of 46 AIDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A control group of 42 healthy HIV-negative blood donors was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects of the control group were IgG-ACA-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 84 HIV-positive patients, 50 were IgG-ACA positive (59.5%) and 34 IgG-ACA negative (40.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the HIV-positive patients presented any thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found with respect to sex, risk factors and stage of disease when the presence of IgG-ACA in HIV-positive patients was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACA does not appear to be a pronostic marker in HIV-1-infected subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of IgG-ACA is probably related to HIV-1-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> itself, and is indicative of impaired humoral immunity in these patients </plain></SENT>
