<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methodology applied was the following: retrospective analysis of 30 patient files (20 female, 10 male) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four types of therapy were evaluated for their efficacy to prevent thrombotic recurrences, aspirin 100 mg daily plus low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 10-15 mg daily, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (with international normalized ratio 2 to 2.6), immunotherapy alone and no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients was followed-up during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free survival was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier method, while the statistical significance was tested by the log rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 21 patients with primary APS and 9 with secondary, 8 of whom had SLE and one patient who had primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the disease duration did not differ between men and women, while patients with secondary APS had a longer disease duration than patients with primary APS, a finding indicating that SLE patients develop, for unknown reasons, APS a long time after the initiation of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients experienced recurrent thrombotic events (a total of 46 recurrences) of which 43 (93%) were identical to the first event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the majority of the cases arterial were followed by arterial and venous by venous thrombotic events: a finding suggesting a tissue-related factor for initiation of thromboses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
