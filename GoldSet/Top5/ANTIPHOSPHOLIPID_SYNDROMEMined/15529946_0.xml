<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 41-year-old woman, affected by Vaquez syndrome, admitted to our hospital for a severe pain in the right hypochondrium, suddenly followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory data were suggestive of hepatic insufficiency and abdominal ultrasonography, integrated by color Doppler and computed tomography, revealed an interrupted hepatic venous outflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition a spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> was present and the patient was found to be positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transient clinical improvement, with a partial reperfusion of suprahepatic veins, was achieved with medical treatment by using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and paracentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the patient showed a subsequence of suprahepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, although two transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts with stent placement and local thrombolysis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera is a disease mainly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> but, in our patient, the thrombotic event occurred in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of hematocrit and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Certainly in this case the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positivity represents an additional thrombogenic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nowadays the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is a recognized and not unusual cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> but, to our knowledge, this is the first case characterized by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome to be reported </plain></SENT>
