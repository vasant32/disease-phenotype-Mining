<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes have a dual role in blood coagulation: they are essential for the initiation and propagation as well as for the limitation and termination of the blood coagulation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) carrying antibodies against complexes of anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and plasma proteins, show in vitro inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependent coagulation reactions, whereas in vivo the presence of these antibodies is associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we focussed on the effects of these anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies on the regulation of TF-mediated factor Xa (FXa) generation in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies interfere with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent inhibition by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) of TF-induced coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, total-IgG, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-IgG (aCL) and anti-beta2GPI-IgG, isolated from patient plasmas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimulated TF-induced FXa generation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This enhanced FXa generation was not observed when the patient's IgG was depleted of anti-beta2GPI-IgG or when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma was depleted of beta2PGPI or TFPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that antibodies to beta2GPI, circulating in patients with APS, suppress TFPI-dependent inhibition of TF-induced coagulation, which results in an increased FXa generation </plain></SENT>
