<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 14 patients with primary APS (PAPS) and 32 with secondary APS based on SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies were examined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidences of malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disorder</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, immunological disorder, and hypocomplementemia were significantly less frequent in patients with PAPS than in those with secondary APS based on SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, sustained positive reactions of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were found in 86% of patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequency of IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies was significantly higher in patients with PAPS (100%) than in those with secondary APS (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, titer of IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies was significantly higher in patients with PAPS than in those with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies are useful for identifying a subset in patients with APS as well as for studying the mechanism of thrombotic events in these patients </plain></SENT>
