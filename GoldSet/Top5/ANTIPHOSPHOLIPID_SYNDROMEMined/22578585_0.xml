<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Clinical data were collected and analyzed for consecutive children diagnosed with thrombotic storm, aged 6 months to 21 years inclusive, in the context of a single-institution prospective inception cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic storm was defined as newly diagnosed multisite venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> progression despite conventional or higher than conventional dosing of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluations and therapies were ordered by the treating physicians in the context of clinical decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of the 178 children with VTE enrolled in the cohort between March 2006 and November 2009 were diagnosed with thrombotic storm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were acutely positive in 6 children, of whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was confirmed by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> release assay in 2 and atypical in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One child died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five children received a direct thrombin inhibitor, titrated to achieve normalization of markedly elevated D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were transitioned to fondaparinux or enoxaparin before receiving extended anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunomodulatory therapy was instituted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median duration, 3 years; range, 2-6 years), 3 of the 7 surviving children experienced recurrent VTE, and 4 children had clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postthrombotic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thrombotic storm is an infrequent but potentially fatal presentation of VTE in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Administration of direct thrombin inhibitors and immune modulation can achieve quiescence, although long-term adverse outcomes are common </plain></SENT>
