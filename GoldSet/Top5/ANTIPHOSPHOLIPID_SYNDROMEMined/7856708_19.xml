<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Pregnancy outcomes were evaluated in five patients with 17 unsuccessful previous pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 400 mg/kg immunoglobulin for 5 days monthly beginning in the first or early second trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were treated with concomitant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients received 81 mg of aspirin daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Short- and long-term decreases of anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G were noted in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients were delivered of healthy infants at term, one at 32 weeks' gestation with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> nor fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin therapy was not associated with major side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant placental histologic anomalies were not identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggest that immunoglobulin therapy may improve pregnancy outcomes beyond that observed with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A prospective trial is encouraged </plain></SENT>
