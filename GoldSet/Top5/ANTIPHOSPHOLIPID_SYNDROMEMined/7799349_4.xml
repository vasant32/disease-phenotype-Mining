<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if antimitochondrial type 5 antibodies (AMA5) might be included among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective study, blood variables of 48 patients with AMA5 were analyzed in relationship with clinical and biological markers of APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a high prevalence of false biological test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (95%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) (71%), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) of IgG (71%) and IgM (75%) isotype, positive direct Coombs' test (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (52%), anti-B2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (61%) had at least one clinical manifestation of APS; 42% had recurrent arterial and/or venous deep <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 21% had recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But, for 2 patients, AMA5 were the sole detected immunological marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SLE was observed in 35% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were different from 100 control patients with SLE with the respect to skin involvement and dsDNA antibodies which were less frequent (p &lt; 0.01) and aCL, LAC, false biological test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), positive direct Coombs' test and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) which were more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggests (1) AMA5 is another marker of the APS (2) in patients with SLE, AMA5 seems to be a marker of a subset of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This appears to justify the routine detection of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
