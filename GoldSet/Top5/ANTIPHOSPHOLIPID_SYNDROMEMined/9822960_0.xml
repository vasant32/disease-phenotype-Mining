<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ocular fundus of (NZWXBXSB) F1 mice, which are considered to be a good model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormal fundus findings were documented by fundus photography, and the chorioretinal lesions were studied histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ocular fundus abnormalities and systemic signs in these F1 mice was significantly higher in males than in females, as with the systemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This indicated an influence of the Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions in the fundus appeared as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">white spots</z:e>, which increased in number during the course of the disease and developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in some animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This developmental course resembled the course of patients with multifocal posterior pigment epitheliopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of the veins and narrowing of arteries were marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings included: (1) destruction of the photoreceptor cell layer, (2) degeneration and loss of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium, (3) thickening of the wall of the choroidal arterioles, and (4) narrowing and occlusion of the choriocapillaris associated with hyaline degeneration and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of the SLE mouse model should contribute to the understanding of the abnormalities in the fundus associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
