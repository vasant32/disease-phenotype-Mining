<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a minimally invasive vascular and interventional radiological procedure indicated in the management of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional TIPS requires the presence of a patent hepatic vein and reasonable accessibility to the portal vein, and in patients with totally occluded hepatic veins, this procedure is technically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) or so called "percutaneous TIPS" involves ultrasound-guided percutaneous simultaneous puncture of the portal vein and inferior vena cava followed by introduction of a guidewire through the portal vein into the inferior vena cava, as a deviation from conventional TIPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Described here is our experience with DIPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients with BCS who had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> but were unsuitable for conventional TIPS due to occlusion of the hepatic veins were chosen to undergo the DIPS procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our technical success was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The shunts placed in two patients remain patent to date, while the shunt in a third patient with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was occluded a month after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percutaneous TIPS procedure seems to be technically feasible and effective in the management of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> as a result of BCS, particularly in the setting of occluded hepatic veins </plain></SENT>
