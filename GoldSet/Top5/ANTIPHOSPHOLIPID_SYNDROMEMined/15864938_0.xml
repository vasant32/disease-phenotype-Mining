<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study included 30 patients who were alternately assigned to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient had had at least two consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on two occasions, and a complete evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients treated with low-dose aspirin, 12 out of the 15 (80%) pregnancies ended in live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the fish oil derivate group 11 out of the 15 (73.3%) ended in live births (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the low-dose aspirin and the fish oil derivates groups with respect to gestational age at delivery (39.9 +/- 0.4 vs 39 +/- 1.5 weeks), fetal birth weight (3290 +/- 200g vs 3560 +/- 100 g), number of cesarean sections (25% vs 18%), or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in terms of pregnancy outcome between women with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome treated with low-dose aspirin or fish oil derivates </plain></SENT>
