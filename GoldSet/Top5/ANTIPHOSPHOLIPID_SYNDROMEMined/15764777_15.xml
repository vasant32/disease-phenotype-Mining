<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of perioperative anticoagulation therapy for patients having a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> who are receiving long-term oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalent approach is to discontinue oral anticoagulation therapy and initiate <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another potential strategy is to continue oral anticoagulation therapy with a temporary adjustment of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> intensity to a preoperative international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 to 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such moderate-dose anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> has been shown to be hemostatically safe yet effective in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after hip or knee replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over an 11-year period (ie, 1993 to 2003), our hemostatic consultative service prospectively identified 100 consecutive patients for whom we continued <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy at adjusted doses during the perioperative period, targeting a goal for the INR of 1.5 to 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned a score for venous thromboembolic risk as well as overall surgical risk using published instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Score assignment was based on what was deemed to be extremely high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients who were receiving long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the patients were accrued prospectively, the final retrospective analysis was made after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common indication (62%) for high-risk assignment was a thromboembolic event within the past 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second most prevalent reason was prior postoperative venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) [11%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indications for long-term anticoagulation therapy were recent VTE (62%), inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (13%), mechanical heart valves (18%), and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> probably has been grossly underestimated, as neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> nor prothrombin 20210 mutation had been described during the bulk of the accrual time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most surgical procedures (58%) were significantly invasive (Johns Hopkins category 3 to 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean INR values were 2.1 on the day prior to surgery (SD, 0.9594; range, 1.2 to 6.5; n = 65), 1.8 on the day of surgery (SD, 0.4899; range, 1.2 to 4.9; n = 75), and 1.8 on the first postoperative day (SD, 0.4436; range, 1.1 to 3.3; n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients had major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and four patients had minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Several weeks after surgery, one patient with a prosthetic heart valve died from an embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which was associated with a failure to increase his anticoagulation to therapeutic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, targeting a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.0, appears to be a safe and feasible method for preventing thromboembolic complications in high-risk surgical patients who are receiving long-term oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This may be considered a reasonable method to afford thromboprophylaxis in highly selected patients who are occasionally seen in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This observational study does not prove equality, let alone superiority, to other proposed methods of anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
