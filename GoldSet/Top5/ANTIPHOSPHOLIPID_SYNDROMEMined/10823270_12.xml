<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel ELISA system to detect complement-fixing ability of anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), and evaluated its clinical usefulness through studying the prevalence of the antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, especially in association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 189 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, the complement-fixing aCL was positive in 26 (83.9%) of 31 patients with APS and 2 (1.3%) of 158 with other disease categories, whereas it was not positive among 52 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of 28 patients (96.4%), who were positive for complement-fixing aCL, had the episodes or history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e>, at the time we studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining one in this group developed APS manifesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarction</z:e> and occlusion of mesenteric artery 6 months after the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of this assay system were 75.0% and 99.3%, respectively, in relation with thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the IgG aCL were positive in 28 (77.8%) of 36 cases with recent thrombotic episodes and 24 (15.7%) of 153 cases with no recent thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of IgG aCL assay system were 77.8% and 84.3%, respectively, in relation with thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that complement-fixing aCL may specifically occur in association with the episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> in patients with APS compared to IgG-aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method for detecting the complement-fixing aCL is simple, and it provides the useful diagnostic marker for thrombotic manifestations associated with APS </plain></SENT>
