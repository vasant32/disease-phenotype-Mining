<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven pregnancies in primary APS (PAPS) patients were compared with 49 pregnancies in patients with UCTD and SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 175 healthy pregnant women were studied to calculate a normality range for C3 and C4 during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such a range was applied to define hypocomplementaemia in PAPS and UCTD/SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups of patients (PAPS and UCTD/SS) showed significantly lower levels of C3 and C4 in each trimester as compared with healthy women; conversely, no significant difference was found between PAPS and UCTD/SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing PAPS pregnancies with and without complications, no difference was found in the prevalence of low C3 or low C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No association was found between hypocomplementaemia and obstetric complications in PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, both cases of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> were characterized by low C3 throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the complement system is a contributor to the mechanisms of aPL-mediated damage, but its predictive role on the final pregnancy outcome does not seem to be of major impact </plain></SENT>
