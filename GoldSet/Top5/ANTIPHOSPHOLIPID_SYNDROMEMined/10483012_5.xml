<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between neuropsychological impairment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (aPL syndrome) in patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erythermatosus (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Sixty-nine patients satisfying ACR criteria were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with the aPL syndrome and 53 patients without the syndrome were subjected to eight neuropsychological tests, a physical examination and serological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patients with other pathology, known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> impairment of neuropsychological function, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five underwent MRI scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, level of education, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or disease activity in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation coefficients revealed a significant negative correlation with duration of disease in six out of eight tests in the aPL positive group and one out of eight in the aPL negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that aPL syndrome may be involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848772" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological impairment</z:e> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger cohort needs to be studied to confirm this observation </plain></SENT>
