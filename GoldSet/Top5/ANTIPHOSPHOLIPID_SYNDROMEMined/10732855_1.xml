<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 14-year-old male with this anomaly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> during exercise complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to hospital with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and sudden cardiac collapse that occurred while he was running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a narrowed segment in the LMCA and impaired blood flow, prompting a diagnosis of extensive anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency bypass surgery was performed using a single saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery </plain></SENT>
