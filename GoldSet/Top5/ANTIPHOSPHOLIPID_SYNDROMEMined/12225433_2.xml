<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: End stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APAS) are at high risk for the development of post-transplant <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Positive titre of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) is considered a major characteristic of APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, several studies have suggested that ACA in patients with APAS do not bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (beta 2gp1), a 40-kD plasma protein is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have tested a hypothesis that significant portions of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients with APAS have antibodies only to beta 2gp1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from each of 169 ESRD patients waiting for cadaver renal transplant in August 2000 were tested for ACA and anti-beta 2gp1 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of these patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> that met the criteria established by the Eighth International Symposium on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They included frequent arterio-venous (a-v) shunt <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, frequent abortions and microrenal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three of the patients (20%) had positive titre of either ACA or beta 2gp1 or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had ACA antibodies, of which eight had no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorder</z:e> while remaining 20 patients had various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these 20 patients with APAS had the positive titre of ACA only; the remaining six patients had both the antibodies, i.e. anti-beta 2gp1 as well as ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were four patients with APAS that had positive titres of only beta 2gp1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In total there were 11 patients with beta 2gp1 antibodies, 10 of which had APAS, the remaining one did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and the specificity of ACA test were 83 and 94%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of beta 2gp1 antibody test were 71 and 99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The chi-square analysis demonstrated that there was statistically significant correlation between positive titres of both the antibodies and the presence of APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The APAS in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients should be characterized by not only the positive titre of ACA but also the positive titres of anti-beta 2gp1 antibodies in association with history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
