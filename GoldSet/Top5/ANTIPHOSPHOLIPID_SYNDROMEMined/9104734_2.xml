<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients with primary APS (PAPS) we investigated by flow cytometry the presence of circulating activated platelets as defined by the surface expression of activation-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> CD62 and CD63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationships among activated platelets, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and platelet associated IgG (PalgG) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects CD62, but not CD63 expression, was found significantly increased in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> thrombocytopenic subjects showed a percentage of CD62 expressing platelets above the cut off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In thrombocytopenics a significantly increased percentage of CD62 and higher levels of aCL IgG were found compared to PAPS patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between activated platelets and both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> antibodies and PalgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that circulating activated platelets are detectable by flow cytometry in the majority of PAPS patients and suggest the existence of a relationship among activated platelets, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and aPL levels </plain></SENT>
