<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients, aged 2-13 years, who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, and cerebral angiographic findings, 3 children were diagnosed as having infarctions due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and the others as having idiopathic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serologic studies revealed elevated anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) IgG in 3 of the 5 patients with idiopathic infarction; no such elevation was revealed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
