<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for the classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) have been utilized for the detection of obstetrical APS in women with RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, laboratory findings and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> of obstetrical APS are significantly different from those of classical APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, many women with RPL who have positive aPL do not have symptoms consistent with the current APS criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The induction of a proinflammatory immune response from trophoblasts and complement activation by aPL rather than thromboembolic changes has been reported as a major immunopathological feature of obstetrical APS </plain></SENT>
