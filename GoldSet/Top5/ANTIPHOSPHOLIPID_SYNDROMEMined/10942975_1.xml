<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) are zwitterionic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> that have been recently described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgM is the most frequently observed isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the potential relationship between serum IgM levels and their presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two patients (66 females, 6 males) positive for aPE of the IgM isotype were followed up for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They suffered from either an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> or had clinical signs suggesting the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two control patients (58 females, 14 males) of similar age, with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> were also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For each of them, the IgM level was obtained and hyper-immunoglobulinemia M (hyper-IgM) was defined as a value upper than 2.5 g/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Search for aPE of the IgM isotype was made using an in-house Elisa test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Half of the aPE-positive patients had serum hyper-IgM, whereas none of the aPE-negative patients had hyper-IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IgMs were polyclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation (r = 0.57, P = 0.001) between the level of IgM and the optical densities obtained by Elisa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of a hyper-IgM did not modify the clinical manifestations (arterial and venous thromboses, recurrent fetal losses), nor the positivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin and anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The positive correlation between the IgM level and aPE level is of value, as it suggests a possible relationship between lymphocytic activation and auto-antibodies production, which does not concern only aPE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies regarding the antigenic specificity of IgM will probably provide further insights on IgM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> interactions </plain></SENT>
