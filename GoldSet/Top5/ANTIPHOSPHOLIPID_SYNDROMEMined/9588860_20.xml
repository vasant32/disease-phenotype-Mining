<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since a beta 2-GPI are often found in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL), their role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as well as other central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) manifestations in APS is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, investigated whether affinity-purified a beta 2-GPI bind the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte and neuron cell lines and histological sections were used as <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence and/or streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase techniques revealed that astrocytes, neurons and vascular endothelium were bound by purified a beta 2-GPI (mouse monoclonal, rabbit polyclonal, human serum Ig a beta 2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests a potential role for a beta 2-GPI in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> damage, as a beta 2-GPI might contribute to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> pathology by either a direct interaction with astrocytes and neurons or an interaction with cerebral vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> immunoreaction was also demonstrated using six a beta 2-GPI-positive sera from patients (four with neurological manifestations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No binding to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> was seen using a beta 2-GPI-negative sera, i.e. five from SLE patients (two with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement) and six healthy donors, or a monoclonal aCL without a beta 2-GPI immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> reactivity by the a beta 2-GPI-positive sera appears specifically due to a beta 2-GPI and independent from aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of the presence of aCL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient sera, and the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in three control patients, it is not possible to attribute a direct role for a beta 2-GPI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
