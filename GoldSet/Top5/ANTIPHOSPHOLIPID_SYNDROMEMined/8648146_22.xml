<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study focused on the utilization of this technique to induce the production of anti-endothelial cells Abs (AECA) and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in a murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AECA were derived from a Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> patient's plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG was purified by absorption on a proteinase-3 affinity column resulting in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absorbed IgG fraction displayed a high titer of AECA as evidenced by a cyto-ELISA against unfixed human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BALB/c mice were actively immunized with the purified AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months after a boost injection with the human AECA, mice developed endogenous AECA (AB), but not Abs to proteinase-3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, or DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination of lungs and kidneys revealed both lymphoid cell infiltration surrounding arterioles and venules; as well as deposition of Igs at the outer part of blood vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This experimental animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, a product of our method of idiotypic manipulation, provides the first direct proof for the pathogenicity of AECA </plain></SENT>
