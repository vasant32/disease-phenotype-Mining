<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen valves from ten patients with APS, obtained from autopsies or removed during valve replacement, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of valves were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group included seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves from patients who died from non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other group of valves were obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006689'>bacterial endocarditis</z:hpo> during autopsies or valve replacement operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence stainings with antibodies to human immunoglobulins, endothelial cells, alpha3beta1 integrin, collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three histopathological patterns were apparent: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves, valves with verrucous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and valves with fibrocalcific changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the valves with verrucous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> the following findings were observed: (1) increased expression of the alpha3beta1 integrin on the endothelial cells, (2) increased amount of collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin, (3) proliferation of blood vessels and (4) linear subendothelial deposition of immunoglobulins and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The valves with fibrocalcific changes were deformed and showed a thick layer of collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin, yet in two valves the indothelial cells showed an expression of the alpha3beta1 integrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control valves did not express the integrin and had only a thin subendothelial band of collagen IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In valves from patients with APS, 1 markers of endothelial cell activation are upregulated while the inflammatory exudate is scant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is also a prominent deposition of immunoglobulins in the valves from patients with APS, suggesting a possible association between the deposition of the antibodies and the activation of the endothelial cells in APS </plain></SENT>
