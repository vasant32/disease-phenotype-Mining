<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate whether the presence or absence of valvular disease at the time of diagnosis of APS, assessed by an initial echocardiogram, predicts its subsequent evolution, we performed a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 53 patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An initial transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on patients at the time of diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiograms were conducted along a 12-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final echocardiograms were used for comparative purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We started with 29 patients (54%) with and 24 (45%) without valvulopathy at initial echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the final echocardiogram, 27 of 29 patients with initial valvulopathy continued to have valvular disease (a 93% observed likelihood), and 22 of 24 patients without initial valvulopathy demonstrated an absence of valvular disease (a 91% observed likelihood) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with valvulopathy in comparison with those without presented more arterial thrombotic events (69% vs. 20%, P &lt; 0.001), atherosclerotic risk factors (62% vs. 29%, P = 0.01), livedo (48% vs. 16%, P = 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (41% vs. 12%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have identified two subtypes of APS patients with and without valvulopathy by defining differential clinical features and with little crossover in valvular involvement over a long follow-up period, giving a high prognostic value to the initial echocardiographic assessment </plain></SENT>
