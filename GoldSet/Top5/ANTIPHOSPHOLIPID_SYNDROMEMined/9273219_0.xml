<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LA is detected in many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> but also in subjects without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined LA in 133 patients, mostly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three screening and two confirmatory tests based on different mechanisms of clotting system activation were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA was found in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DRVVT was the most useful test in detecting LA while kaolin clotting time was the least sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) of IgG class were found in 41 patients studied (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were most often detected in patient positive for LA (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ACL IgM were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting times</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laboratory diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is easy when the presence of LA is confirmed by two independent tests and in addition ACL would be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In other cases, when only single tests are positive, it is suggested to repeat diagnostic procedure at least once </plain></SENT>
