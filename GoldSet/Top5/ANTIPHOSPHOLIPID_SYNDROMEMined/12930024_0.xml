<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard double centrifugation method to prepare plasma was inadequate for platelet elimination, interfering with kaolin clotting time and mixing studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the percentage correction of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and Russell's viper venom time (RVVT) by high compared with low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> was used for both screening and confirmation of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormality in either one was reported as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the tests in 122 individuals without LA was 100 per cent for RVVT and 96.7 per cent for APTT, which yielded false positive by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mixing study was omitted from the authors' strategy without decreasing the specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 795 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, LA was detectable in 6.03 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of diluted activated partial thromboplastin time (dAPTT) and diluted Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) alone, compared with the combination of the two was 83.3 per cent and 79.2 per cent respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this new test scheme is a simple, inexpensive and efficient method for Thai patients </plain></SENT>
