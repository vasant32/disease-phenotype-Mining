<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>Placental dysfunction</z:mp> may account for these complications yet the mechanisms remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst these, an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the placental vasculature could play a role, involving recruitment of neutrophils and platelets and the increased endothelial expression of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (CAM), central to the recruitment process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was primarily to investigate CAM expression in the fetoplacental vasculature in women with SLE/APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulating maternal concentrations of soluble CAM were also elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in CAM immunostaining in placentae from patients with SLE and/or APS compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both patients and controls moderate immunostaining for the intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was observed in placental vascular endothelium and mild immunostaining was present in the placental villous stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong immunostaining for platelet endothelial CAM (PECAM) occured in the placental vascular endothelium whereas P-selectin was mildly expressed in the stem vessel endothelium only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin were undetectable in either study or control placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 but not E-selectin, as assessed by immunoassay (ELISA), were elevated in maternal serum from SLE/APS patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that upregulation of CAM expression and subsequent activation of neutrophil and/or platelet activity within the placental villous tree is unlikely to be a mechanism by which the adverse pregnancy outcome arises in SLE/APS pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, maternal endothelial cell activation (ECA) may play a more important role </plain></SENT>
