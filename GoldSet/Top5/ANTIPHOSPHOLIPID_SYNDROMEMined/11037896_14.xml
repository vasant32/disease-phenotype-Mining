<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the 4G/5G polymorphism of the type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) gene and thrombotic manifestations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a total of 247 patients included in the following 4 groups: 70 patients with primary APS, 104 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (40 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> [aPL] and clinical [secondary] APS, 13 with aPL but without clinical APS, and 51 with neither detectable aPL nor a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), 14 asymptomatic individuals with aPL, and 59 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but without known <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group of 100 healthy individuals was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and endonuclease digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The allele frequency of 4G/5G in controls was 0.47/0.53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in allele distribution among patient groups or between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a higher frequency of the 4G allele was observed in APS patients with versus those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (0.57 versus 0.39; P &lt; 0.05) (odds ratio [OR] 2.83, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-6.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This higher frequency of the 4G allele was attributable to the higher frequency in patients with versus those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (0.64 versus 0.43; P &lt; 0.01) (OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.67-21.32), while patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> had an allele distribution similar to that of those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (0.49 versus 0.50; P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher PAI-1 antigen and activity levels in APS patients and controls with the 4G/4G genotype, but this did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of the 4G allele of the 4G/5G polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene may be an additional risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in APS </plain></SENT>
