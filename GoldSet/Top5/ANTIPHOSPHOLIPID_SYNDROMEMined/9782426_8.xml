<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and serologic findings of 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>)-positive patients within a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Measurement of visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, fundus examination and perimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests were performed for detection of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> against thromboplastin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA), antibodies to dsDNA, antithyroidal and antiparietal antibodies were also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A combination of both transient and permanent visual disturbances was noticed in more than half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transient visual disturbances included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo>, partial defects of the visual fields and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent permanent abnormalities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> in 20 patients, due to AION in 9 cases, and disturbances of the choroidal circulation in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourty-six patients had positive levels of thromboplastin <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were found to be increased in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a clear correlation between <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> activity or the immunoglobulin classes in the individual and the severity of the ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The benefit from a therapy with the antiplatelet agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> was evident in a reduction of the patients' transient visual disturbances and, in most cases, no further progression of permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
