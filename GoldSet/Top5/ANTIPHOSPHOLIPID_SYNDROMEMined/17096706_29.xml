<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The major antigen implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dimerized beta2GPI binds to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E receptor 2' (apoER2') on platelets and increases platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to collagen under conditions of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether the interaction between dimerized beta2GPI and platelets is sufficiently strong to resist shear stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the interaction of platelets with immobilized dimerized beta2GPI under conditions of flow, and further analyzed the interaction using surface plasmon resonance and solid phase immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that dimerized beta2GPI supports platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregate formation under venous flow conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> of platelets to dimerized beta2GPI was completely inhibited by the addition of soluble forms of both apoER2' and GPIbalpha, and the addition of receptor-associated protein and the removal of GPIbalpha from the platelet surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GPIbalpha co-precipitated with apoER2', suggesting the presence of complexes between GPIbalpha and apoER2' on platelet membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interaction between GPIbalpha and dimeric beta2GPI was of intermediate affinity (Kd = 180 nM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deletion of domain V from dimeric beta2GPI strongly reduced its binding to both GPIbalpha and apoER2' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies that inhibit the binding of thrombin to GPIbalpha inhibited platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to dimeric beta2GPI completely, while antibodies blocking the binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor to GPIbalpha had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dimeric beta2GPI showed reduced binding to low-sulfated GPIbalpha compared to the fully sulfated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We show that platelets adhere to dimeric beta2GPI under both arterial and venous shear stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelets adhere via two receptors: GPIbalpha and apoER2' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These receptors are present in a complex on the platelet surface </plain></SENT>
