<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients (44 eyes) with primary APS (17 women, 5 men) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were younger than 50 years (median age; 37.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients, fundus flourescein angiography was performed in addition to the ophthalmologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (72.7%) described visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anterior segment was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 19 patients (86.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Posterior segment abnormalities were observed in 15 patients (68.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and tortuosity were the most common ocular findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> vascular occlusive disease was detected in 5 patients (22.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flourescein angiography abnormalities were noted in 14 of the 18 patients (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common angiographic finding was pigment epithelial window defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that posterior eye segment involvement is relatively common in the primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It also seems that the screening for APS is important in young patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, especially in those without conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
