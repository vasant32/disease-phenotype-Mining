<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results may shed light to a novel aspect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 171 patients with SLE, 56 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and 18 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus vulgaris</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) were studied employing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> antibodies along with 94 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In parallel, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> concentrations in the serum were determined by a DiaSorin commercial kit (LIAISON 25 OH <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody-positive and antibody-negative individuals were compared with respect to demographic variables, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score, autoantibodies profile, and serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in 7 (4%) of 171 patients with SLE, in 2 (3.5%) of 56 of sera from patients with APS, and in 2 (11%) of 18 sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were similar in both SLE groups with and without anti-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographic features, organ involvement, SLEDAI score, and autoantibodies did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Except for anti-dsDNA antibodies, in which anti-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> antibodies were strongly associated with these antibodies in sera from SLE patients (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> antibodies are observed in a subset of patients with SLE, APS, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, and are associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to explore the potential diagnostic and prognostic role of these novel antibodies in SLE </plain></SENT>
