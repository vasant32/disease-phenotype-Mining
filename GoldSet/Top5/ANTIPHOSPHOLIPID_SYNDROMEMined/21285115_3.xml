<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age 18-65 years, no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and two consecutive positive aPL results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, laboratory and clinical parameters were collected at enrolment, once a year during the follow-up and at the time of the thrombotic event, whenever that occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 258 subjects were prospectively observed between October 2004 and October 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD follow-up was 35.0 ± 11.9 months (range 1-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A first thrombotic event (9 venous, 4 arterial and 1 transient ischaemic attack) occurred in 14 subjects (5.4%, annual incidence rate 1.86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) were significantly predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (both at p&lt;0.05) and thromboprophylaxis was significantly protective during high-risk periods (p&lt;0.05) according to univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and LA were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis as independent risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 11.1, p&lt;0.05, and HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 14, p&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and LA are independent risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in aPL carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis in these subjects should probably be limited to high-risk situations </plain></SENT>
