<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Complement activation and ineffective clearance of complement-bearing immune complexes via erythrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormally high levels of erythrocyte C4d and low levels of complement receptor 1 (CD35) have been reported in SLE and might have diagnostic utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether erythrocyte C4d and complement receptor 1 were specific for SLE and whether there was any association with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of complement receptor 1 (CD35) and complement protein C4d on erythrocytes was measured by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry on the same day as the blood draw, in patients with SLE, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the SLE population, there was no association with disease activity measured by the physician's global assessment or SELENA SLE Disease Activity Index, nor with past or current <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assays were not specific for SLE, with higher levels also seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overlap of erythrocyte C4d and CD35 between SLE and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> limits their utility as diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, longitudinal investigation of these assays is warranted, especially given the higher levels in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
