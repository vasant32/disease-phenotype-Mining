<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) by an ELISA method in 80 Mexican <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients and 378 of their first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty five percent of SLE patients and 16% of their relatives were positive for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also determined allele and haplotype frequencies of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes (classes I, II and III) in both patients and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MHC allele and haplotype frequencies of aCL positive and negative individuals were compared to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with aCL had statistically significant increased corrected frequencies of HLA-DR3 (pC = 0.04, RR = 2.78); DR7 (pC = 0.005), RR = 3.42) and DQ2 (pC = 0.003, RR = 2.58) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their first degree relatives positive for aCL also had increased frequency of HLA-DR7 but it did not remain significant after correcting the P value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, SLE patients negative for aCL had a moderate increased frequency of DR3 and DQ2 but not of DR7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DR7 associates with the presence of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution of MHC alleles in SLE patients positive for aCL resembles that found in their aCL positive first degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the presence of the antibody is not sufficient to predict a clinical outcome, we studied those patients with reliable clinical data regarding the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with aPLS had significantly increased frequency of DR7 (pC = 0.004), as did those with probable aPLS (pC = 0.05), while the frequency of DR7 in SLE patients in the doubtful or negative aPLS categories was no different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data support a possible role of DR7 in the development of aCL in SLE patients and their relatives and suggest a contribution of this class II MHC antigen to the development of aPLS within SLE </plain></SENT>
