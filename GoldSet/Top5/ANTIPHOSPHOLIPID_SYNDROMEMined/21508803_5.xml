<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNt Abs) against HIV-1 are rarely produced during natural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and efforts to induce such Abs by vaccination have been unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, elucidating the nature and cellular origins of bNt Abs is a high priority for vaccine research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the bNt monoclonal Abs (MAbs) 2F5, 4E10 and 2G12 have been reported to bind select autoantigens, we investigated whether these MAbs display a broader range of autoreactivity and how their autoreactivity compares with that of pathogenic autoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An autoantigen microarray comprising 106 connective tissue disease-related autoantigens and control antigens was developed and used, in combination with ELISAs, to compare the reactivity profiles of MAbs 4E10, 2F5 and 2G12 to those of four pathogenic autoAbs derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid-syndrome</z:e> (APS), and to serum from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The APS MAbs and SLE serum reacted strongly with multiple autoantigens on the microarray, whereas anti-HIV-1 MAb reactivity was limited mainly to HIV-1-related antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The APS autoAbs reacted strongly with CL, yet only 4E10 bound CL at high concentrations; both 2F5 and 4E10 bound their HIV-1 epitopes with a 2-3-log higher apparent affinity than CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the polyreactivity of 4E10, but not CL15, could be blocked with dried milk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reactivity profiles of bNt anti-HIV-1 MAbs are fundamentally distinct from those of pathogenic autoAbs that arise from dysregulated tolerance mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the limited polyreactivity observed for the bNt MAbs, and for HIV-1-Nt Abs in general, may arise through alternative mechanisms, such as extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> due to persistent antigen selection during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
