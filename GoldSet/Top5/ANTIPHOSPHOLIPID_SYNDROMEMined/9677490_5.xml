<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunoserological assays of patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and progressive hearing losses have revealed the presence of different antibodies, leading to the assumption that immunological processes may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have demonstrated that these patients have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies that can cause venous or arterial vasculopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we analyzed the incidence of these antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera of 55 patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001730'>progressive hearing loss</z:hpo> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">Phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies were demonstrable in 49% of the patients with sudden hearing loss and 50% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001730'>progressive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">Serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> antibodies were found in 53% of the patients with sudden hearing loss and 63% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001730'>progressive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since these three antibodies are also frequently found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia syndrome</z:e> (FMS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e>), 28 of the patients studied displayed symptoms typical for these disorders, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo>, sicca symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We now recommend questioning patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear disorders</z:e> for symptoms typical for FMS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e>, since these diseases are often closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If symptoms are present, antibodies should be tested against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If present, the antibodies are diagnostic for each syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally these immunologic and serologic findings show that these antibodies may play a role in the etiology of hearing loss disorders </plain></SENT>
