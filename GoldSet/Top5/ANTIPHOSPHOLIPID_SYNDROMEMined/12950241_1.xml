<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a rare case of bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal glands diagnosed in the context of positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient presented atypical clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigation showed complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal failure</z:e> and increased aPL, both manifestations persisted 1 yr after the initial event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging at baseline was compatible with bilateral hemorrhagic infarction and showed almost complete loss of viable adrenal tissue 1 yr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no direct causal effect can be proved, the sequence of events and the exclusion of other common causes of bilateral adrenal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e>) support an association between aPL and adrenal hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A unique link between particular anatomical characteristics of the adrenal fascicular zone and a novel, previously described, explanation model of aPL-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is based on the properties of late endosomes, which are important organelles participating in cholesterol trafficking and protein sorting within cells and express <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to investigate adrenal tissue for presence of late endosomes and their aPL relevant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for proof of this tempting hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Focal accumulation of aPL and isolated, simultaneous, bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal infarctions</z:e> could thus be explained </plain></SENT>
