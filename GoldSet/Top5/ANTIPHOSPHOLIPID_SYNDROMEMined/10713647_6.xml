<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found IgM-RF, IgG-RF, IgA-RF, IgM-aCL, IgG-aCL, IgA-aCL, respectively, in 35.4%, 35.4%, 33.8%, 23.1%, 23.1%, 20.0% of 65 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Class specific RFs were negatively associated (P&lt;0.05) with IgG-aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of definite or probable aPLS according to Alarcon-Segovia classification criteria was significantly (P&lt;0.05) different (8.7% vs 30.9%) in patients with or without IgG-RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the other clinical features of SLE, we found that patients with IgG-RF, compared to patients lacking this autoantibody, showed a lower frequency (P&lt;0.05) of serositis (21.7% vs 52.4%) and hematologic (52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2% vs 80.9%) disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of IgG-RF and IgM-RF negatively correlated with the number of ARA criteria (P&lt;0.05) but not with the indices of diseases activity or damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that in SLE the presence of RFs are not markers of severity of the disease, but the negative association between IgG-RF and IgG-aCL suggests a distinct role of these autoantibodies in the pathology of SLE, whereas the presence of IgG isotype may identify a subset of SLE patients having a lower risk to develop some clinical manifestations such as aPLS </plain></SENT>
