<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence, clinical associations and pathogenic roles of autoantibodies to CD40 ligand (CD40L) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma anti-CD40L antibodies from 125 patients with SLE, 24 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and 90 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) and from 62 healthy individuals were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HeLa cells transfected with human CD40L cDNA (HeLa/CD40L) were used to confirm the presence of anti-CD40L autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-CD40L antibodies on the CD40L-CD40 interaction was evaluated by observing CD40L-induced IkappaB activation in CD40-expressing fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-CD40L autoantibody was detected in seven (6%) SLE, three (13%) primary APS and 11 (12%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, but in no healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding in an ELISA was competitively inhibited by membrane components of HeLa/CD40L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD40L antibody-positive IgG specifically bound the surface of living HeLa/CD40L, as shown by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in SLE patients with the anti-CD40L antibody than in those without (100 vs 14%; P&lt;0.00001), whereas there was no association between the anti-CD40L antibody and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Binding of the anti-CD40L antibodies in patients' plasma to CD40L was competitively inhibited by a series of mouse anti-CD40L monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-CD40L antibody-positive IgG failed to inhibit CD40L-induced IkappaB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CD40L autoantibody is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings are potentially useful in understanding the complex roles of CD40L in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and haemostasis as well as the thromboembolic complications that occur during treatment with anti-CD40L humanized antibody </plain></SENT>
