<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) as the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in 122 patients we investigated for aPL and to correlate the presence of aPL with clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (n = 41), thromboembolic episodes (TEE) (n = 34), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (LR) without (n = 17) or with (n = 14) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent fetal losses (RFL), systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> (n = 10), and miscellaneous disorders (n = 6) were investigated for antibodies directed against 4 anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) and then for aPE by modified ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 15 patients had aPE and no antibodies to anionic PL including LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>7 had IgM, 4 had IgG plus IgM, and 4 had IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These aPE were significantly more often associated with TEE alone, with TEE and LR, or with LR alone (p = 0.004) than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detection of aPE as the sole aPL in one patient with mesenteric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and RFL led to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Followup of 3 patients showed that aPE cannot be considered as transient autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients whose clinical symptoms suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> but whose sera are negative for antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or another anionic PL should be screened for aPE, particularly patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, RFL, and/or LR </plain></SENT>
