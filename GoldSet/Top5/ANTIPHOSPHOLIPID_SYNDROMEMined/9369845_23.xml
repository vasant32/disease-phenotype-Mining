<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are associated with pregnancy loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that annexin-V, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding protein with potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, is present on the apical membranes of the syncytiotrophoblasts that line placental villi and that this protein is reduced, by immunohistochemistry, on placentas of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether annexin-V in apical membranes of placental villi is quantitatively reduced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> immunoglobulin G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Placentas were obtained from an index patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> and from a patient with an uncomplicated pregnancy who were both delivered by cesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apical villous membranes were isolated and annexin-V levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then studied the effects of antiphospholipid immunoglobulin G on placental villous apical annexin-V in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid immunoglobulin G was isolated from the sera of five different patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome along with five paired control immunoglobulin Gs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term cultures were established from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placental villi and were exposed to the antibodies, after which isolated apical membranes and culture media were immunoassayed for annexin-V levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Measurements of apical membrane-associated annexin-V from the antiphospholipid placenta showed significantly less apical membrane-associated annexin-V than did the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placenta (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 4.9 +/- 0.4 micrograms/gm villi for antiphospholipid placenta vs 10.2 +/- 0.6 micrograms/gm villi for control, p &lt; 0.001, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure of placental villous cultures to five different antiphospholipid immunoglobulin Gs for 24 hours resulted in significant reduction of the levels of apical membrane annexin-V (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 3.9 +/- 0.3 micrograms/gm villi) compared with paired controls (5.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms/gm villi, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Villi incubated with the different antiphospholipid immunoglobulin Gs had significantly less annexin-V in conditioned media (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>: 45.1 +/- 4.9 ng/gm villi) compared with the paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunoglobulin G control levels (72.6 +/- 11.4 ng/gm villi, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antiphospholipid immunoglobulin G reduces the levels of syncytiotrophoblast apical membrane-associated annexin-V in placental villi and the release of annexin-V into surrounding media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reduction of this <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein at the maternal-fetal interface may account for the pregnancy loss observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Short-term culture of placental villi may offer an in vitro model to further study the mechanism of this effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
