<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five monoclonal aCL were established from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 3 patients with the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of monoclonal aCL with various PLs, with DNA, and with beta 2-GPI was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the monoclonal aCL bound to anionic PLs, only in the presence of beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither monoclonal aCL nor beta 2-GPI bound to DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal aCL bound to solid-phase beta 2-GPI on <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> ELISA plates that had carboxyl groups on their surface, but did not react with solid-phase beta 2-GPI on ordinary <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mixture of beta 2-GPI and CL inhibited the binding of monoclonal aCL to beta 2-GPI, but CL or beta 2-GPI alone did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monoclonal aCL may recognize a cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, which appears as a result of beta 2-GPI binding to anionic PLs or to <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> with carboxyl groups </plain></SENT>
