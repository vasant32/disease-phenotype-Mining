<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed to have SLE at 39 years of age, and was administrated steroids and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 52 years of age, AA, peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, and multiple organ infarctions appeared repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 59 years of age, she was found to be affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the following year, expansion of an abdominal AA was identified, but she was given only conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the next year, sudden epigastralgia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> occurred, and she died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An autopsy revealed multiple AAs up to 11 cm in diameter, one of which showed ruptures, forming a retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the aorta was noted, and she also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> accompanied by cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were also confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although SLE with APS is common, a complication of the disease by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e>, multiple AAs, or ruptured AA has been described in several cases to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding the etiology of this complicated presentation, we presume synergistic involvement of various factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CMN</z:e> associated with SLE, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> due to APS, and prolonged steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
