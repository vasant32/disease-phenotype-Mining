<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that in mice both of these processes are caused by the inhibition of eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In studies of cultured human, bovine, and mouse endothelial cells, the promotion of monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> by aPL entailed decreased bioavailable NO, and aPL fully antagonized eNOS activation by diverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, NO-dependent, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced increases in carotid vascular conductance were impaired in aPL-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of eNOS was caused by antibody recognition of domain I of β2GPI and β2GPI dimerization, and it was due to attenuated eNOS S1179 phosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor family member antagonism with receptor-associated protein (RAP) prevented aPL inhibition of eNOS in cell culture, and ApoER2-/- mice were protected from aPL inhibition of eNOS in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both aPL-induced increases in leukocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were absent in eNOS-/- and in ApoER2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, aPL-induced leukocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are caused by eNOS antagonism, which is due to impaired S1179 phosphorylation mediated by β2GPI, apoER2, and PP2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that novel therapies for APS can now be developed targeting these mechanisms </plain></SENT>
