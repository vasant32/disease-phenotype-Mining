<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six murine monoclonal antibodies directed against human beta 2GPI were compared with anti-beta 2GPI antibodies associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The beta 2GPI-dependent binding properties to neutral and anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were studied, as well as the target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the beta 2GPI molecule and the effect of various beta 2GPI treatments to get rid of contaminating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> or to block the beta 2GPI-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> interaction </plain></SENT>
