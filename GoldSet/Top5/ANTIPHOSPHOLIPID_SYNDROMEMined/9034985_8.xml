<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and isotype distribution and their clinical associations with the features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in 3 different ethnic groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 152 African-American, 136 Afro-Caribbean (Jamaican), and 163 Hispanic (Colombian) unselected patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were studied for the prevalence of aCL and isotype distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> aCL measurements were performed in the same laboratory by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive results for 1 of the 3 aCL isotypes were found in 42 African-Americans (28%), 28 Afro-Caribbeans (21%), and 43 Hispanics (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL was the dominant isotype in Hispanic and African-American patients, while IgA was the dominant isotype in Afro-Caribbeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, IgA aCL was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Afro-Caribbean patients who were aCL positive, while only 3 patients in this group had IgG aCL and 2 had IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of the APS were found to correlate better in Hispanics than in African-Americans and Afro-Caribbean patients with aCL isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the existence of ethnic differences in the prevalence and isotype distribution of aCL as well as in their clinical relevance in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the role of genetic and/or environmental factors in the observed differences are required </plain></SENT>
