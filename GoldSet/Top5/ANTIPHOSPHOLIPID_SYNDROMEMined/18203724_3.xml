<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work suggests that the perinatal environment may be important in the development of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in a general population with well-defined early lives to see whether fetal and infant growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were associated with aCL positivity in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aCLs were measured using an ELISA in 1384 individuals from the Hertfordshire cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations between the presence of aCL and early growth and infectious exposure in infancy in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ELISA positive aCL (IgM and IgG) was present in 22 (3%) men and 15 (2%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the highest octile of aCL results, in men higher birth weight (per lb of birth weight: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36, P = 0.02) and diarrhoeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the first year of life (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.10, 5.92, P = 0.03) were associated with an increased likelihood of being aCL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, diarrhoeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the first year of life was also associated with an increased likelihood of aCL positivity (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.01, 4.91, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For IgG titre in men, significant relationships were found with sharing a bedroom (regression coefficient 1.13; 95% CI 1.05, 1.22; P = 0.02) and diarrhoea in the first year (coefficient 1.25; 95% CI 1.00, 1.56; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A developing immune system when exposed to the infectious environment may influence the likelihood of producing aCL in adult life </plain></SENT>
