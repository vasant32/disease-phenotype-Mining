<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study of changes in the levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in secondary APS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) included 219 patients (28 males and 191 females) with APS observed at least for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL in the blood were measured each half of year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients was 31.2 +/- 11.1 years, mean duration 8.6 +/- 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups: 54 patients (persistently positive) of group 1 had IgG-anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in the blood for the whole period of the observation, were positive by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>73 patients of group 2 were initially aPL-positive, but aPL levels fluctuated in the observation period from positive to negative and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>92 patients of group 3 had no aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 3-year follow-up 25% of SLE patients were aPL positive, 42%--negative, aCL levels fluctuated in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No APS symptoms were observed in 9%, 33% of groups 1 and 2, respectively, but APS symptoms appeared in the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>10% of group 3 had some aPL-associated signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aCL levels did not depend on mean daily dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in groups 1 and 2 initially and within the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequency of LA, irrespective of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> dose, was significantly higher initially vs that in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In spite of correlation between aPL positivity and SLE activity, depressed activity of the disease during the treatment did not entail a significant lowering of a PL levels in the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> in APS in SLE patients influence LA more than aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SLE activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> therapy in APS are independent factors affecting aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Detection of aCL and LA in SLE is not the cause of prescription of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
