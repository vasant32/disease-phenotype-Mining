<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) is a non-cardiogenic form of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> characterised by severe hypoxaemia refractory to oxygen therapy, with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> on chest radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be precipitated by various serious medical and surgical conditions, including systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "catastrophic" variant of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is an accelerated form of this systemic autoimmune condition which results in multiorgan failure because of multiple small vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with catastrophic APS who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> were selected from the web site based international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (CAPS registry) (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) and their characteristics examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pulmonary involvement was reported in 150 of 220 patients with catastrophic APS (68%) and 47 patients (21%) were diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (40%) of these patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies were undertaken in 10 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> was present in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in age, sex, precipitating factors, clinical manifestations, or mortality between catastrophic APS patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> is the dominant pulmonary manifestation of catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus the existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> in the context of an APS makes it necessary to rule out the presence of the catastrophic variant of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
