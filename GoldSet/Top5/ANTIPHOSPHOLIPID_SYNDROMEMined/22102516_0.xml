<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study in 135 women with singleton pregnancies and at least one of the following high-risk conditions: PE and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> in a previous pregnancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, pregestational <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m(2) , <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean uterine artery pulsatility index (mUtA-PI) at 11-13 and at 19-22 weeks' gestation was measured and analyzed according to quantitative and semi-quantitative models, to predict late PE (resulting in delivery ≥ 34 weeks) and early PE (delivery &lt; 34 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Late PE developed in 21 (15.6%) pregnancies and early PE in six (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using mUtA-PI, the detection rates of late and early PE for a false-positive rate of 10% were 14.3% and 33.3%, respectively, at 11-13 weeks, and 19.0% and 66.7%, respectively, at 19-22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a semi-quantitative approach, the group of pregnant women with mUtA-PI ≥ 90(th) percentile at both 11-13 and 19-22 weeks had a greater risk for early PE (odds ratio, 21.4 (95% CI, 2.5-184.7)) compared with the group with mUtA-PI &lt; 90(th) percentile at both periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a quantitative approach, there was relative worsening in the mUtA-PI (multiples of the median) from the first to the second trimester in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of early PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The application of semi-quantitative and especially quantitative models to evaluate sequential changes in uterine artery Doppler findings between the first and second trimesters could be of additional value in assessing high-risk women regarding their true risk of developing early PE </plain></SENT>
