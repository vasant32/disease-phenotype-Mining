<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were interviewed and underwent a general physical examination by qualified rheumatologists on the day of blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The population comprised 119 woman and 22 men with a mean age at diagnosis of 44 years (range 9-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients (49.6%) had primary APS, and 71 (50.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 85.8 per cent, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was found in 93 patients (66.0%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found in 46 patients (32.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> [86/141 (61.0%)] followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> [33/141 (23.4%)] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was noted in Japanese patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and complex clinical manifestations was substantiated in Japanese patients with APS </plain></SENT>
