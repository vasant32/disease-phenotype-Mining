<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Development of an obstructive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is virtually unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who twice was seen with hemodynamically significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of an aortic valve homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was suspected on the basis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> increase in the transvalvular gradient and was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation proved to be effective in relieving the obstruction, but recurrence after discontinuation of acenocoumeral suggests that treatment should be long term, if not lifelong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is the first reported case of thrombotic obstruction of an aortic valve homograft </plain></SENT>
