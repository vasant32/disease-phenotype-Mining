<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that it is possible to induce, in naive mice, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) by idiotypic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we expanded our experience to examine whether idiotypic manipulation could be utilized to induce organ-specific autoantibodies and a disease mediated by cellular mechanisms, namely, experimental autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen BALB/c mice were immunized with a monoclonal mouse anti-human thyroglobulin (hTg) antibody; controls were immunized with an irrelevant mouse IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice immunized with anti-hTg antibody developed, 6 weeks after immunization, autoantibodies to human thyroglobulin, but not to dsDNA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, or myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of specific autoantibodies was associated with low production of thyroid hormones, and during a follow-up of 20 weeks the mice did not develop characteristic histological signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that idiotypic manipulation can induce anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
