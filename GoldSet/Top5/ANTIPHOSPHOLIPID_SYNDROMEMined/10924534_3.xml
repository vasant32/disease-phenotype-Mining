<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for therapy, the rate of subsequent serious events was 6.86-fold higher (p=0.0001) in patients presenting with two events, 1.56-fold higher (p=0.038) in autoimmune haemolysis presentations, 1.69-fold higher (p=0.004) in patients with anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies, and 46% (p=0.063) lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> presentations </plain></SENT>
