<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, since these are nonspecific and standardization is lacking, the results of laboratory work-ups upon which diagnosis are made are often misleading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performance of clinical laboratories in detecting LA using lyophilised affinity purified immunoglobulin has been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same material was used to investigate the inter-laboratory variability of aCL and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) antibody measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratories were asked to test <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma spiked with purified IgG or distilled water in order to obtain 3 samples positive for aCL and anti-beta(2)-GPI at different antibody concentration (A, B and C) and 3 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five laboratories participated and interpreted their test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> performed an ELISA for IgG aCL antibodies, while 17 also tested samples using IgG anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity were calculated on the basis of the responses provided by each laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 99/105 samples were correctly interpreted as positive and 97/101 as negative for the presence of IgG aCL, corresponding to a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, 46/51 samples were correctly defined as positive and 50/51 as negative for the presence of IgG anti-beta(2)-GPI corresponding to a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A wide variability in results pertaining to the positive samples was found for aCL-ELISA (coefficient of variation of 79%, 59%, and 53% for samples A, B, and C, respectively) as well as for abeta(2)-GPI-ELISA (coefficient of variation of 85%, 95%, and 50% for samples A, B, and C, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to those centres using the same commercial kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median antibody concentrations reported by centres for positive samples were consistent with the prolongation of coagulation tests assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among these, dRVVT showed a good sensitivity and linear correlation with aCL antibody concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, on the whole this survey found correct interpretation of positive and negative samples by both ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless the high variability of reported data remains a major problem that only a consensus on the part of laboratories and manufacturers to utilize standard, uniform materials and procedures can hope to overcome </plain></SENT>
