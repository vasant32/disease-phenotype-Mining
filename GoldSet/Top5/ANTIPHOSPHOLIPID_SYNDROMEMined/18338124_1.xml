<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This paper describes chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) findings of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 23 episodes of DAH in 20 patients, 17 of known aetiology and three of unknown aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were studied by CXR and 15 also by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal consolidations and ground-glass opacities were evaluated after dividing each lung into three regions (upper, middle, lower) for a total of six zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consolidations or ground-glass opacities were identified on CXR in 16/20 patients, mainly in the middle fields (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4/20 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>, CXR was negative or demonstrated only nodular opacities; in two of these cases, CT revealed ground-glass opacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A complete follow-up was available for ten patients: initially, they showed consolidation opacities in 36/60 zones, which persisted in 16/60 after 7 days and in 11/60 after 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, ground-glass opacities increased after 7 days owing to the partial regression of consolidation opacities, and they markedly diminished after 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DAH is radiologically characterised by a nonspecific alveolar-filling pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis or suspicion of DAH needs to be supported by the evidence of haemoptysis and/or rapid-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT is superior in detecting ground-glass opacities and is required in cases of suspected DAH with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CXR findings </plain></SENT>
