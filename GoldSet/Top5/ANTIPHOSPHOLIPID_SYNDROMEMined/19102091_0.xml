<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study was retrospective from January 2000 to December 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed according to the criteria of the international consensus statement in 1999 on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female) were collected with a median age of 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> was associated in 7 cases, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> in 1 case and mix connectivity in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dermatological manifestations found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of the extremities (4 cases), purpuric lesions (4), cutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001063'>acrocyanosis</z:hpo> (2), livedo (1) and subungual splinter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The obstetrical incidents were noted in 82% of cases; there were precocious and repeated abortions (in 5 cases), foetal loss (in 4 patients), precocious delivery (in 2 cases), lateness of growth in uterus (in 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean level of anticardiolipin antibodies was 60 UGPL and a dissociation of the syphilitic serology was present in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A severe <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> in 1 case was observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In other cases, we noted foetal loss in 2 cases and distal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> relapse in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cutaneous manifestations are diverse </plain></SENT>
