<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial included 206 patients (57 males and 149 females, age 16-59, mean age 35.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 58 (28%) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) alone, 148 had documented concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy two (48.6%) SLE patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), 29 (19.6%)--anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) level above 40 IU in two and more measurements without clinical symptoms of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to standard tests, APL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>), aCL and antibodies to beta-2 glycoprotein, blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and atherothrombosis risk factors were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound dopplerography estimated thickness of IMC in the carotid and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 89 donors free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean values of IMC thickness did not differ between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaques (ASP) were detected in 25 (12%) of 206 patients: in 5 (9%) from PAPS group, 10 (14%) from SLE+APS, in 4 (14%) and 6 (13%) from SLE groups aPL+ and aPL-, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean age of patients with ASP was 46 +/- 6.9 years (32-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ASP occurrence was associated with older age: ASP were detected in 10 (38%) of 26 patients aged over 51 years (24 plaques), in 10 (20%) of 50 patients aged 41-50 years (18 plaques) and in 5 (10%) of 50 patients aged 41-50 years (18 plaques) and in 5 (10%) of 50 patients aged 31-40 years (9 plaques, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMC thickness and plaques were associated with prior arterial and venous thromboses and occurred significantly more frequently in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and atherothrombosis risk factors were associated with changed IMC thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The level of aPL and their type had no effect on IMC thickness and ASP incidence in the groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased IMC thickness was associated with age irrespective of APS presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In SLE, ASP appeared at younger age than in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Atherothrombosis risk factors affect IMC thickness irrespective of the level and type of aPL </plain></SENT>
