<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurement of autoantibodies was carried out by standardized ELISA method using MELISA anticardiolipin IgG and IgM kits (Walker Diagnostics, Cambridgeshire, UK) A positive result indicated a value in GPL or MPL U/ml more than 3 SD above the mean value obtained with control sera of 48 healthy pearsons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG isotype alone, and both isotupe of anticardiolipin antibodies were found in 30 percent, in 6,7 percent and in 11,7 percent of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High or medium levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 patients with actual venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, but in only 3 out of 10 patients with history of thromboembolic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients with actual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and 3 female with recent spontaneus abortion also had elevated levels of the same isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) were significantly associated with recent or history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we emphasize the association of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies with recent events of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
