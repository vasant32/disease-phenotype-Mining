<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The idiotype 1.10, which was derived from a patient with active SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, was found more frequently among patients with PAPS (10.5%, 10.5% and 22.2% in MG, SLE and PAPS, respectively) than the idiotype H3, which was derived from a human hybridoma monoclonal aCL generated from a healthy subject immunized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012546" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diphtheria</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter idiotype was detected in 8.7%, 6.5% and 11.7% of patients with MG, SLE and PAPS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidental findings in this study include a high prevalence of aCL among patients with MG (23%) and a high prevalence of anti-dsDNA antibodies, detected only by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, among patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that idiotypic diversity exists among aCL derived from different sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of these cross-reactive idiotypes may be more pathogenic than others </plain></SENT>
