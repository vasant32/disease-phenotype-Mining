<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: HRI is a new Doppler index calculated as a ratio between S -maximal systolic flow and D -maximal early diastolic reversed flow -HRI=D/S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic significance of HRI calculated from the Doppler spectrum of popliteal arteries in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (SAPS) compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: During 9-month period (May 2003 -January 2004), 93 patients (81 women and 12 men) with SLE (including 24 patients with SAPS) and 30 healthy controls (24 women and 6 men) underwent bilateral duplex Doppler examinations of lower limb arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examinations were performed using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi> 3500 (ATL) with 5 -12 MHz linear transducer under standardized conditions: correct insonation angle and sample volume size, with the patient in a supine position, after 10 minutes rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean HRI value obtained in the control group was 0.415 (range 0.305 -0.555; median 0.402) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of SLE patients without SAPS, mean HRI value was decreased to 0.320 (range 0 -0.584; median 0.334) and even lower -0.283 in SLE patients with SAPS (range 0.106 -0.545; median 0.291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small arteries, arterioles and capillaries are the main affected vessels in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> process stimulates circulation through lower resistance collaterals, decreasing HRI value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Doppler HRI calculation can be valuable in early diagnosis and monitoring of lower extremity vascular changes in patients suffering from SLE with and without SAPS </plain></SENT>
