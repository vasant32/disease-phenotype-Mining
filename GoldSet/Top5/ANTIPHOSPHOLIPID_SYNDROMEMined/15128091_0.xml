<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because patients often develop long-standing wounds, it is important for the wound care nurse to identify clients suspect for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several theories exist speculating on the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, and each focuses on changes at the interface between the vessel, cell wall membrane, and its interaction with circulating antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As wound care nurses, we should consider <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> thromboses whenever encountering a recalcitrant wound without obvious underlying cause </plain></SENT>
