<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Some investigators have reported that anti-prothrombin autoantibodies (aPT) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positive sera were detectable by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies in aPT ELISA were observed by some investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify this situation, we tested the binding of aPT positive sera to purified prothrombin under various conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed aPT ELISA under different conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The variables we tested were: ELISA plate (untreated or gamma irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates), buffer (phosphate buffered saline or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> buffered saline), detergent (presence or absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween-20</z:chebi>), and antigen condition (intact or fragmented prothrombin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-PT from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were similarly bound to prothrombin with both buffers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween-20</z:chebi> to the buffer increased reactivity in the irradiated plate assay, but decreased reactivity in the untreated plate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactivities in 90% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> sera were decreased by the use of fragmented prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the reactivity of serum from a healthy subject was remarkably increased by antigen fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The discrepant ELISA results in measurement of aPT in the various reports may have been due to the use of detergent in the buffer and condition of the prothrombin used as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our experiments the best ELISA condition for measurement of aPT was achieved using buffer with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween-20</z:chebi> detergent, with prothrombin directly coated onto irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
