<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: We wanted to study and examine whether the detrimental effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on gestation is locally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we established an experimental rat model, enabling to study the intrauterine effect of serum, containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera were obtained from five women, having anticardiolipin antibody and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pooled serum of 150 microL was injected into unilateral uterine horn of each rat on days L2-L7 of rat pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contralateral uterine horn was used for injection of 150 microL <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum or physiologic saline as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats were sacrificed on day L14, and the uterus of each rat was inspected for the presence of live and resorbed fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> and viability was observed following the intrauterine injection of antiphospholipid positive serum (APL positive serum), as compared with the intrauterine injection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate and decrease in fetal viability was noted following the injection of APL positive serum on day L6 (P = 0.005 and 0.004, respectively) and day L7 (P = 0.003 and 0.003, respectively) as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comparison with the contralateral injection of saline demonstrated a significant effect of the APL positive serum also following the intrauterine injection on days L3 and L5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides an experimental rat model, which can be employed to study the local intrauterine effect of APL positive serum on pregnancy outcome and to further assess the efficacy of various treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
