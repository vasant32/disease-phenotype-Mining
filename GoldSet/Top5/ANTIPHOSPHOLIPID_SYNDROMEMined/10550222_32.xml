<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased prevalence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) and increased levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation have been described in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the binding specificity and avidity of aPL antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e>, sera from 44 HIV-1 infected patients were evaluated for antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine (aPS), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (aPI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (aPC) using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), but without features of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) (SLE/non APS), six with SLE and secondary APS, (SLE/APS) and 11 with primary APS (PAPS) were also evaluated as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resistance of the aPL antibody binding to dissociating agents was evaluated by treating the ELISA wells, after serum incubation with 2 M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> or 0.6 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2-GPI) ELISA was used to assess serum reactivity against beta2-GPI, a plasma protein considered as the true antigen of aCL antibodies occurring in APS and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aCL, aPS, aPI and aPC antibodies in HIV-1 infection was 36%, 56%, 34% and 43% respectively, which was comparable to that found in SLE/APS and PAPS patients and significantly higher than that observed in SLE/non-APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies occurred in 5% of HIV-1 infected vs. 17% in SLE/non-APS (P=0.11), 50% in SLE/APS (P=0.009) and 70% in PAPS patients (P=0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of aPL binding after <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> treatment was observed in the sera of HIV-1-infected, compared to that of APS patients, indicating that aPL antibodies from HIV-1 infected individuals have low resistance to dissociating agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aPL antibodies (1) occur in HIV-1 infection; (2) tend to recognize various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> but not beta2-GPI; and (3) are of low resistance to dissociating agents-a finding probably reflecting low antibody avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, these, like the autoimmune-type aCL antibodies, tend to recognize the oxidized CL-a finding probably indicating autoantibody generation as a result of neoepitope formation by oxidized PLs </plain></SENT>
