<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We undertook a study of four patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> after each patient experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> attributable to ingestion of vegetal foods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgE antibody levels to various foods were determined in serum specimens from the study patients, and skin prick tests with the same <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> were conducted to determine their in vivo responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematologic, cardiopulmonary, vascular, and rheumatologic studies were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG anticardiolipin antibody levels were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients fulfilled the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and had high levels of specific IgE antibodies for certain food <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By immunoblot analysis, the presence of serum IgE specific for a 45-kD protein band in an almond extract was detected in these four patients who experienced food-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No specific IgE was detected in sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No IgE antibodies specific for the food panallergen <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> transfer proteins were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of severe food-precipitated <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and the first description of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to blackberry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible involvement of food panallergens distinct from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> transfer proteins is also discussed </plain></SENT>
