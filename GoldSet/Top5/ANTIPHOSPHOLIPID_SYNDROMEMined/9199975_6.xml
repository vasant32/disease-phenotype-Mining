<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used deleted mutants (DM) representing different domains of beta 2GPI (I-IV, IV-V and V) for immunization of naive mice and studied the characteristics of the respective murine IgG preparations in comparison with affinity-purified IgG from two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunization with beta 2GPI and with the DM produced anti-beta 2GPI antibodies, part of which reacted with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL), whereas reactivity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was evident only in the IgG from mice immunized with beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the presumption that aPL are induced following the in vivo association of beta 2GPI (used for immunization) with resident negatively charged PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, DM which either lack the PL binding site or aPL attachment locus did not elicit, upon immunization, antibodies reactive with PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, murine anti-beta 2GPI IgG and human 'autoimmune' aPL were similar, albeit not identical, in terms of DM requirement for PL binding and charge dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Murine antibodies and human aPL, regardless of their binding characteristics, were found to bind significantly to platelets upon their activation with thrombin and to promote platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study emphasize the dissimilarities between human 'autoimmune' aPL and murine anti-beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, anti-beta 2GPI antibodies to different DM as well as human aPL are capable of binding and activating human platelets provided beta 2GPI is present </plain></SENT>
