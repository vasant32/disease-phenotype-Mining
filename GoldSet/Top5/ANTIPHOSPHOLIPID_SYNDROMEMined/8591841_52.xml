<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study anticardiolipin antibodies (immunoglobulin G [IgG] isotype) were determined in serum from 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C and 52 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) markers (anti-HCV and HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) were investigated in 73 patients with thrombotic disorders and no clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>; of these patients 37 cases tested negatively for anticardiolipin antibodies and 36 positively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin test was positive more frequently (22%) in the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C than in healthy controls (1.9%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using conditional logistic-regression analysis we found that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C patients the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> and the existence of prior thrombotic episodes were significantly related to positivity for anticardiolipin antibodies (P &lt; .05 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> and a history of thrombotic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C markers were absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases who tested negatively for anticardiolipin antibodies (n = 37), but were present in 16.7% of those positive for anticardiolipin (n = 36) (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, anticardiolipin antibodies are frequently found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C and in these patients they may be implicated in the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
