<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: 75 pregnant women with obstetrical complications and 66 controls with live births without obstetrical complications were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The obstetrical complications in the study group were unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001562'>oligohydramnios</z:hpo> = 16 (21%), IUGR = 17 (23%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> &lt;32 weeks = 15 (20%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> = 42 (56%), fetal demise = 14 (19%), abruption = 8 (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing women with obstetrical complications versus controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> was present in 7 (10%) versus 1 (2%) P =.064, odds ratio (OR) = 7, 95%, CI = 0.8-58.5, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome in 14 (19%) versus 2 (3%) P =.003, OR = 7, 95% CI = 1.7-35, high <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> A levels 13 (30%) versus 6 (10%) P =.019, OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.3-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the study group, there was a case each of prothrombin gene mutation, elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level, antithrombin III, protein S&amp;C deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> diagnosis was present in 24 (32%) versus 3 (5%) of controls p =.001, OR = 9.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 22 women who subsequently became pregnant, prophylactic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy compared to pretreatment control pregnancies showed 22 versus 11 live births P =.001, 95% CI = 0.3-0.7 and obstetrical complications of 2 (9%) versus 22 (100%) P =.001, OR = 11, 95% CI = 2.9-41.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An association is suggested between non-thromboembolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> and hypercoagulable disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy may be associated with improved pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
