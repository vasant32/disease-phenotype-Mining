<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DI is the dominant target of pathogenic autoimmune antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), a disease characterized by antibody-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats primed with DI conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DI-KLH) were rendered tolerant to subsequent antigen challenge by treatment with multivalent conjugates of DI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to DI were suppressed 89-96% with intravenous doses of 500 micro g, and reductions were paralleled by decreases in splenic antigen-specific antibody-forming cells (AFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suppression was achieved with a variety of conjugates having two to four copies of DI and circulating half-lives of 2.6-8.7 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to KLH were not suppressed, indicating the specificity of the approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results establish the basis for further development of therapeutic B cell toleragens to suppress pathogenic antibodies in APS and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
