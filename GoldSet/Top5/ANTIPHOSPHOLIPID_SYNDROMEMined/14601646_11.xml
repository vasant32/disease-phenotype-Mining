<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred ninety five patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were studied for the presence of antibodies against six anti-beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory parameters of APS was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and correlated with the presence of each anti-beta2GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rates of the various antipeptides Abs ranged from 18.0 to 63.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 87.1% of the patients had antibody reactivity against at least one of the six beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high degree of simultaneous reactivity against several beta2GPI-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative correlations were found between several antipeptides Abs and the rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results point to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> activity of antiphospholipid Abs in APS patients, directed, often concurrently, against various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the beta2GPI molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of APS patients for the presence of specific antipeptides Abs may be of a value in predicting the risk for future thrombotic and obstetrical complication, as well as for specific therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
