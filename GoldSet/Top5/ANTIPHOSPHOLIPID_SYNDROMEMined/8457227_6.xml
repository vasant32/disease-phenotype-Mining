<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a family, including identical twins and their mother, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and presented with different manifestations of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Review of case histories and clinical laboratory results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) studies, complement C4 protein and gene analysis, and HLA typing of family members were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each of the 3 family members presented with a different clinical association of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These various clinical presentations were closely temporally related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No particular aPL activity could be separated out that would account for the different manifestations, although the twin with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> had a strikingly high IgM anticardiolipin antibody level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C4A or C4B deficiencies could not be implicated in the autoimmune process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mother and the twins shared the HLA haplotype that included the class II antigens DR4, DRw53, and DQw7, which has previously been associated with aPL production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This family study emphasizes the different clinical associations of aPL production in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to genetic influences that appear to include HLA class II antigens, the clinical presentations also suggest an environmental trigger </plain></SENT>
