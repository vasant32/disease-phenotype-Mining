<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and coagulation test values in the highest and lowest tertiles were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When considered separately, IgG antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) and prothrombin (aPT) were associated with anamnestic arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, respectively, and those to annexin AV (aAnAV) with abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgM antibodies to protein S and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> ratio of the dilute prothrombin time were associated with prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other association for IgM antibodies was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA-positive patients who carried abeta2GPI antibodies were at risk of anamnestic arterial and total <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aPT antibodies to that of anamnestic venous and total <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA-positive patients who carried IgG abeta2GPI and aAnAV antibodies were at risk for both anamnestic abortion and prospective <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data support the inclusion of abeta2GPI antibodies in and suggest the removal of anticardiolipin antibodies from the laboratory criteria of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that the measurement of aPT and aAnAV antibodies is useful in some selected situations and that there is little role for IgM antibody detection </plain></SENT>
