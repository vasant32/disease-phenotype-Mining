<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with primary APS, 42 control patients with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>, and 36 healthy volunteers were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum complement levels (C3, C4, CH(50)) and anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) were examined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, and serum complement regulatory factors (factor H and factor I) were measured in patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity was determined in a mixing test using the activated partial thromboplastin time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum complement levels were significantly lower in patients with primary APS than in patients with non-SLE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (mean (SD) C3: 81.07 (17.86) vs 109.80 (22.76) mg/dl, p&lt;0.001; C4: 13.04 (8.49) vs 21.70 (6.96) mg/dl, p&lt;0.001; CH(50): 31.32 (8.76) vs 41.40 (7.70) U/ml, p&lt;0.001) or healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two healthy subjects with low serum C4 levels showed hypocomplementaemia, whereas most patients with primary APS showed raised serum C3a and C4a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No subjects showed raised C5a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with primary APS with low serum C3 or C4 had significantly higher levels of C3a or C4a than healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients had low serum complement regulatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with primary APS, hypocomplementaemia was significantly more common in those with high <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity than in those with low or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypocomplementaemia is common in patients with primary APS, reflecting complement activation and consumption, and was correlated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> may activate monocytes and macrophages via anaphylatoxins produced in complement activation </plain></SENT>
