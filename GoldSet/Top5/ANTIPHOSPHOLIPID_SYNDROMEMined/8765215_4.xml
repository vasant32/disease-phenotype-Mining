<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently it has been suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> may not be specific for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> but directed to beta2glycoprotein 1 (beta2GP1), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-beta2GP1 complexes, prothrombin, or prothrombin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore this issue further, we examined the influence of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding proteins, annexin V (placental <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein I (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I)) and beta2GP1, on the activity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), both in the prothrombin-thrombin conversion assay and in the anticardiolipin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that each of eight IgG-APS; fractions, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I and beta2GP1, individually inhibited the prothrombinase reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When IgG-APS samples were combined with <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I or beta2GP1, or both <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I and beta2GP1, inhibition of the prothrombinase reaction was additive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the anticardiolipin ELISA, <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I inhibited IgG-APS binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, but beta2GP1 enhanced IgG-APS binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The "enhancing" effect of beta2GP1 in the ELISA system was neutralized by <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp> I, an effect partially overcome by increasing the concentration of beta2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed when affinity-purified anticardiolipin antibodies were used in place of whole IgG-APS preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that IgG preparations obtained from the 8 patients with APS recognize similar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>; on anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the anticardiolipin test and in the prothrombin-thrombin conversion assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data do not exclude the possibility that the IgG preparations may bind prothrombin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> or beta2GP1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complexes </plain></SENT>
