<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic events, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, are well known presentations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other pulmonary manifestations of the disease like alveolar haemorrhage are rare but can represent a catastrophic aspect of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alveolar haemorrhage in this context is important to recognize since it can be either a complication of anticoagulation therapy or a manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic implications are then very different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a woman with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> treated with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> initially attributed to thrombolytics and recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> considered to be a manifestation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complicated course necessitated a protracted stay in the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and treatment with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and plasmapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Alveolar haemorrhage associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> can be catastrophic and require prompt and aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasmapheresis, usually reserved for the catastrophic aspects of this condition, was felt to be useful in this case </plain></SENT>
