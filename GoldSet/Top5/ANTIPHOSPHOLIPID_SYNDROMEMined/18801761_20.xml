<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify the main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) during a 5-year period and to determine clinical and immunological parameters with prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and immunological features of a cohort of 1000 patients with APS from 13 European countries who had been followed up from 1999 to 2004 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 200 (20%) patients developed APS-related manifestations during the 5-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrent thrombotic events appeared in 166 (16.6%) patients and the most common were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.4% of the total cohort), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (2.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep vein thromboses</z:e> (2.1%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the thrombotic events occurred, 90 patients were receiving oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and 49 were using aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>31/420 (7.4%) patients receiving oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> presented with haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3/121 (2.5%) women with only obstetric APS manifestations at the start of the study developed a new thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 77 women (9.4% of the female patients) had one or more pregnancies and 63 (81.8% of pregnant patients) had one or more live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common fetal complications were early pregnancy loss (17.1% of pregnancies) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> (35% of live births) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>53 (5.3% of the total cohort) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (21% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (19%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No clinical or immunological predictor of thrombotic events, pregnancy morbidity or mortality was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with APS still develop significant morbidity and mortality despite current treatment (oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> or antiaggregants, or both) </plain></SENT>
