<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were detected in sera of 93% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> (179 of 192 patients) in 60 of 277 (22%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (SjS), 34 of 437 (8%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, 33 of 191 patients with SLE (17%), and 5 of 55 (10%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) but in none of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ELISA studies were confirmed by immunoblots showing binding of autoimmune rheumatic sera to the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> (74 kd) of mitochondria that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> sera reacted with </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identical binding characteristics were also confirmed by protein competition assays with purified PDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 53 patients with SjS who were positive for anti-PDH, high titers as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PBC</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-PDH antibodies in Sjogren's patients were associated with deranged liver function tests and extraglandular features but did not correlate with any other non-organ-specific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies confirmed the association of the emergence of anti-PDH antibodies with defects in liver function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were more prevalent in SLE and RA when they were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (30 and 18.8%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, anti-PDH antibodies were noted in subjects with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527383" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">morphea</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
