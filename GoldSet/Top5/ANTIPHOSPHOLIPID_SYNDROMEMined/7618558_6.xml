<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies have been associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> manifested by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, frequent arterial and venous thromboses, recurrent fetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the anatomic distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> as seen on imaging examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory results of patients tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> at a tertiary referral center during the period January 1992 to April 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review revealed 228 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or any other medical condition associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> and patients over 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of the remaining 73 patients had undergone imaging studies of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> or non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiologic studies (contrast angiography or venography, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography or venography, or Doppler sonography) were examined for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients--11 men and eight women, 18-62 years old (average age, 38 years)--with venous thromboses were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients had non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone, three had <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone, and four had both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Locations of non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> thromboses included deep veins of the legs (nine occurrences), pulmonary vessels (five), and large veins in the thorax or abdomen (six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients had documented thromboses at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had recurrent thrombotic events (six with multiple recurrences), including five with arterial thromboses and two with both venous and arterial thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, five had documented thromboses (four dural sinus, one arterial) and two had arterial distribution <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> demonstrated by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients with only non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> thromboses had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Deep veins of the leg were the most common site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The thoracic and abdominal venous system and the dural sinuses--unusual sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the general population--are other common sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> should be suspected when thromboses are found in these locations in the absence of other known risk factors, or when found in combination with arterial thromboses or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> ischemic disease in young or middle-aged patients </plain></SENT>
