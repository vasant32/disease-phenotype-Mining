<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article we report the cases of two patients who were unresponsive to conventional treatment for APS during their first pregnancy, and who were treated in the following pregnancy with plasma exchange and immunoadsorption respectively, in addition to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients had a history of thrombotic events, a previous pregnancy loss at the 11th week of gestation and the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> profile (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and high titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 was treated from the fourth week of her second pregnancy with weekly plasma exchange </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy proceeded normally until the 36th week, when, due to slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo>, she delivered a healthy baby girl weighing 2375 g by cesarean section </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, as a whole these data suggest better disease control using the immunoadsorption technique as compared to plasma exchange, despite their apparently similar anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody removal capabilities </plain></SENT>
