<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Degos</z:e> disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">malignant atrophic papulosis</z:e> is a rare occlusive vasculopathic disease characterized by pathognomonic cutaneous lesions and frequently fatal systemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">malignant atrophic papulosis</z:e> remains unclear, and there is currently no effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">malignant atrophic papulosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several chemokines can potentiate and expand the platelet response to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these chemokines, this study examined the expression of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1/CXCL12, which is secreted by bone-marrow stromal and endothelial cells, activates megakaryocyte precursors, and costimulates platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate and compare the expression of SDF-1/CXCL12 in tissue sections taken from 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Degos</z:e> disease, 2 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">vaso-occlusive diseases</z:e>, and 2 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining involving antibodies to SDF-1/CXCL12 was performed on 3 skin biopsy specimens taken from 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Degos</z:e> disease, 1 from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 1 from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>, and 2 from healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strong SDF-1/CXCL12 staining was observed in the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the perivascular, intravascular, and perineural areas in tissue samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Degos</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No staining was observed in samples from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> or from healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The number of cases available for evaluation was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings were based primarily on the immunohistochemical results and were not confirmed using other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intense staining of SDF-1/CXCL12 in lesions attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221011" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Degos</z:e> disease, demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge in this study, suggests SDF-1/CXCL12 involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
