<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent VTE is still considerable thereafter, and it is uncertain whether some patients might benefit from extended anti-coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective, multicenter trial (4 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> centers) and evaluated in 380 patients with a first or recurrent VTE (patients with a deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, protein S or plasminogen; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>; or an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome were excluded) the risk of recurrence after discontinuation of secondary thromboprophylaxis with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of the study to evaluate whether patients, with factor V Leiden are at an increased risk of recurrent VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>112 (29.5%) patients were carriers of factor V Leiden (26.9% heterozygous, 2.6% homozygous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median observation time of 19.3 months the overall recurrence rate of VTE was 9.9% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of recurrent VTE two years after discontinuation of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> was 12.4% (95% CI 7.8-17) in patients without factor V Leiden and was 10.6% (95% CI 3.8-17.4) in carriers of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with factor V Leiden are not at a higher risk of recurrent VTE within two years after discontinuation of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> than patients without factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Balancing the risk of recurrent VTE and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, patients with factor V Leiden are not likely to benefit from oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy extended beyond six months </plain></SENT>
