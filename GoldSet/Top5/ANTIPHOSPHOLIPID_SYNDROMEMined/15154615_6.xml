<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to study the pathological processes underlying neurological dysfunctions displayed by BALB/C mice induced with experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), as we have previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental APS was induced in female BALB/C mice by immunization with a pathogenic monoclonal anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody, H-3 (n = 10), or an irrelevant immunoglobulin in controls (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice immunized with H-3 developed clinical and neurological manifestations of APS, including: embryo resorption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> neurological defects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mouse sera, the titer of various autoantibodies were elevated, including: anti-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (aPLs), anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2GPI), anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) and low titer of anti-dsDNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five months after APS induction, mice were sacrificed and brain tissue specimens were processed for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E), immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E staining of cortical tissue derived from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APS mice revealed mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, localized mainly in the meninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prominent IgG deposits in the large vessel walls and perivascular IgG leakage were observed by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were observed in large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, EM evaluation of cerebral tissue revealed pathological changes in the microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusion of capillaries in combination with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was the main finding and may underlie the neurological defects displayed by mice with APS </plain></SENT>
