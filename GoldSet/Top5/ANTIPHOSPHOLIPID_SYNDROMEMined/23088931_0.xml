<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a mixed retrospective-prospective cohort study of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> at the Children's Hospital Colorado between March, 2006 and January, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 58 consecutive children - age less than or equal to 21 years - with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data collection included clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments, serial echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings, and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> non-resolution and recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 16.5 years ranging from 0 to 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent clinical risk factors were oral contraceptive pill use (52% of female patients), presence of a non-infectious inflammatory condition (21%), and trauma (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilias</z:hpo> included heterozygous factor V Leiden in 21%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome was established in 31% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proximal pulmonary artery involvement was present in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At presentation, nearly half of the patients had hypoxaemia and 37% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The classic electrocardiographic finding of S1Q3T3 was present in 12% acutely; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> greater than 3 metres per second, septal flattening, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002754'>right ventricular dilation</z:mp> were each present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> echocardiogram in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received therapeutic anticoagulation, with initial systemic tissue plasminogen activator administered in 16% for occlusive iliofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> resolution was observed in 82% by 6 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular dysfunction was rare in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> heart strain is common, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiac dysfunction is rare, following aggressive management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
