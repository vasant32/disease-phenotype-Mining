<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although three cases were performed quantification of cerebral blood flow with a microsphere method simultaneously, their values were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of them showed focal low perfusion areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case had relatively low perfusion areas in the bilateral occipital lobes and the right temporal lobe, which improved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of two had low perfusion in the bilateral occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other three cases only showed uniformity of radioisotope uptake on the cerebral blood perfusion SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low perfusion areas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> might be caused by microarterial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, microvenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or spasms, although they could be reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As early detection of cerebral abnormality admit to protect irreversible progress of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood flow SPECT should be performed in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with neurological complaints </plain></SENT>
