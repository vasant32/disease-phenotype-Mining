<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the significance to assay the antibodies against phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex (aPS/PT) has been discussed, and these antibodies, rather than antibodies against prothrombin alone, are closely associated with APS and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of aPS/PT for the diagnosis of APS were assessed in a population of patients with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aCL and aPS/PT have similar diagnostic value for APS, and most of APS patients with aPS/PT had positive LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aPS/PT should be further explored, not only for research purposes, but also as a candidate for one of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based confirmatory test for APS associated LA </plain></SENT>
