<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It often presents in the reproductive years and has a significant impact on pregnancy outcome, being a significant cause of indirect maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our observational case series of three patients there were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases 1 and 2 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> developed during pregnancy and deteriorated rapidly with markedly abnormal mean pulmonary artery pressures of 80 and 70 mmHg respectively prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> need to be aware of the high risk of maternal mortality associated with pregnancy but we believe that an improvement in outcome can be achieved by careful assessment and the use of a multidisciplinary approach from early in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
