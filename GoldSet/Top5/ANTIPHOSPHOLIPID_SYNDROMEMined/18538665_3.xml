<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> has been frequently described as a cause or trigger of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, we have postulated the association among human parvovirus B19 (B19)-VP1 unique region (VP1u), production of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) antibody and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS)-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of B19-VP1u in induction of APS is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To further elucidate the pathogenic roles of VP1u in B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, we examined the effect of anti-B19-VP1u IgG antibodies on endothelial cells that is recognized to play crucial roles in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human vascular endothelial cells, ECV-304, were incubated with various preparations of purified human or rabbit IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activation of endothelial cells and production of cytokines were assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Purified IgG from rabbits immunized with recombinant B19-VP1u proteins can up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54), VCAM-1 (CD106), E-selectin (CD62E), MHC class II (HLA-DR, DP, DQ) molecule expression, and TNF-alpha production in endothelial cells as compared to those endothelial cells cultured with control IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, significantly increased phosphorylated-P38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) and iNOS were observed in both human anti-beta2GPI IgG and rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG treated-ECV-304 cells, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These experimental results imply that antibodies against B19-VP1u play important roles in the immunopathological processes as well as human anti-beta2GPI IgG that leads to development of APS by involving p38 phosphorylation and iNOS activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could provide a clue in understanding the role of anti-B19-VP1u antibodies in APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
