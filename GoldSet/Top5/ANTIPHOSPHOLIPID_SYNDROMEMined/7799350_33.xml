<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immunohistological distribution of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2 GPI) and placental <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein I (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-I) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological placentae of patients with antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody associated recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These proteins are 2 natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> able to interfere with aPL antibody binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Placentae from 4 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (pAPS), from 2 patients with aPL negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and from 7 healthy women were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryostatic placental sections were tested by indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-I and anti-beta 2GPI antisera as well as purified IgG and anti-beta 2GPI monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same tissue sections were also tested by direct immunofluorescence with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-F(ab)2 goat antihuman IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that (a) the placental distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-I was comparable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological specimens; (b) on the contrary, increased beta 2GPI deposition was present on the trophoblast surfaces of placentae obtained from patients with persistent raised titers of aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparable IgG deposition on villi surface was also found in aPL positive but not in control placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that high titer aPL binds to a beta 2GPI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complex in placentae of women with recurrent fetal loss but that a quantitative deficiency of <z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>-I does not play a pathogenetic role in aPL associated fetal loss </plain></SENT>
