<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore a possible correlation between endothelin 1 (ET-1), the most potent endothelium-derived contracting factor that modulates vascular smooth muscle tone, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of ET-1 were measured in APS patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 11) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and in non-APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, steady-state prepro-ET-1 messenger <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) levels were determined in endothelial cells treated with a range of human monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (as anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies) by semiquantitative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16311">dCTP</z:chebi>-labeled reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, markedly increased plasma levels of ET-1 were found in APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (2.00 +/- 0.87 versus 0.96 +/- 0.37 pg/ml; P = 0.0001) but not in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three human monoclonal aCL induced prepro-ET-1 mRNA levels significantly more than did control monoclonal antibody lacking aCL activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma ET-1 levels correlated significantly with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prepro-ET-1 mRNA was induced by human monoclonal aCL in the in vitro experimental system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of ET-1 by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> might contribute to increased arterial tone, leading to vasospasm and, ultimately, to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
