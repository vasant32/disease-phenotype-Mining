<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) is the most common and apparently the best-characterized antigenic target for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate T-cell responses to beta(2)GPI, we stimulated PBMC of 18 APS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients carrying anti-beta(2)GPI and 10 healthy controls, using a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library covering the beta(2)GPI sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We established seven CD4(+) T cell lines reactive with beta(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for patient-derived T cell lines were p244-264, whereas one T cell line from a control subject also recognized p244-264 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no tendency for particular HLA class II molecules to present beta(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, cytokine producing patterns were significantly different between T cell lines from patients and those from healthy individuals (p =.028); patients' T cells tend to exhibit higher IL-4 and lower IFN-gamma responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These T cell lines did not react to beta(2)GPI purified from human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that beta(2)GPI-reactive CD4(+) T cells of APS/SLE patients mainly recognize cryptic p244-264 in the context of various HLA class II molecules, and exhibit Th0-Th2-type responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings may provide a clue to the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
