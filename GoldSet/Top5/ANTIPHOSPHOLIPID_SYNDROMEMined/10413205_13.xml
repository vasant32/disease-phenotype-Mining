<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 105 women with abortions or fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 33(31%) fulfilled criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients with primary APS, 24% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA), 91% had elevated circulating immune complexes (CIC), 70% had low total haemolytic complement (CH100), 52% had low levels of complement 4 (C4) and 30% had low levels of complement 3 (C3), in a significantly higher prevalence than women whose pregnancies were successful (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through out a 6 y follow-up, 3 (9%) of the patients with APS who had autoimmune related abnormalities when entered into the study developed features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> like disease (LLD) or fullblown SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that women with unexplained repeated PL with APS who presented with positive ANA, high levels of CIC, low levels of CH100, C3 and C4, may define a subset of patients exhibiting immunological alterations similar to those of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These parameters may help in the assessment of prognosis in APS patients with PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those patients should be carefully surveyed with regard to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
