<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical significance of high titers of IgG autoantibodies to nuclear lamin B1 in a large number of unselected and well-characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients, disease controls, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of anti-lamin B1 autoantibodies, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using human recombinant lamin B1 autoantigen, was performed on serum samples obtained at first evaluation of 238 consecutive French Canadian adults: 61 healthy control subjects, 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo>, 22 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>, 11 with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, 30 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, and 94 with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SLE patients were studied for 57 disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was performed to analyze the relationship between anti-lamin B1 status and thrombotic manifestations between SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and last followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High titers of anti-lamin B1 were strikingly restricted to a subset of 8 SLE patients (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean anti-lamin B1 titer was higher in this subset than in the other SLE patients or any control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis and stepwise multiple logistic regression, the most striking association of anti-lamin B1 was with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) antibodies (P = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although LAC were significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in our SLE patients, anti-lamin B1 was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE patients expressing both LAC and anti-lamin B1 was similar to that in patients without LAC (P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients expressing LAC without anti-lamin B1 had a greater frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High titers of IgG anti-lamin B1 autoantibodies are highly specific for a subset of SLE patients whose clinical characteristics include the presence of LAC and other laboratory manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of LAC without anti-lamin B1 may define a subset of SLE patients at greater risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
