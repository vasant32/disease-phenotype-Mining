<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), arterial stiffness, and presence of plaques in APS patients and controls to evaluate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study also explored the relationship between these parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid and femoral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and stiffness were measured in 58 APS patients and 58 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were investigated and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)-related serologic parameters were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Details of the patients' previous medical history and information regarding disease treatment were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, arterial stiffness, and the presence of plaques in patients and controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these parameters were independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in these parameters were found between patients with primary APS and those with secondary APS, or between patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and those with obstetric manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between SLE disease activity and atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with plaques had taken a lower total dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or hydroxychloroquine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some markers of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> could be detected in both primary and secondary APS, irrespective of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> might be an intrinsic finding in APS patients, independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and that immunosuppressive treatment may prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
