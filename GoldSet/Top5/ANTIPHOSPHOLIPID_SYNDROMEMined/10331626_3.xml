<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considerable variability has, however, been reported in the prevalence of anti-PE antibodies in APS patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lack of standardization and differences in technique may in part explain these discrepancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PE binds variably to different types of microtiter wells, reflected in the consequent detection, or lack of detection, of anti-PE antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study describes the use of flow cytometry as an alternative method for the detection of anti-PE antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six LA-positive plasma samples were used in this original study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">Polystyrene</z:chebi> beads were coated with PE overnight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were subsequently incubated with patient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both IgG and IgM binding were detected by flow cytometry using a cocktail of fluorescently labelled anti-human Ig isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When these results were compared with those from ELISA, flow cytometric analysis provided an apparent enhanced detection of anti-PE antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was found that 6/6 were IgM anti-PE positive by flow cytometry, whereas 5/6 were IgM by ELISA; 2/6 negative for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies by ELISA were positive by flow cytometry; and 2/6 positive for antiphosphatidylcholine antibodies in cytometry were negative by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate quantification, this method may be more sensitive than ELISA in detecting anti-PE antibodies in plasma samples of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
