<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation of lymphocytes, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, may therefore be modified by S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a synthetic substance that detaches Ras from the inner cell membrane and induces its rapid degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MRL/lpr mouse is a genetic model of a generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> sharing many features and organ pathology with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of FTS on laboratory and clinical pathology in the MRL/lpr mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female MRL/lpr (n = 50) and MRL/++ control (n = 35) mice were treated intraperitoneally with either FTS (5 mg/kg/day) or saline between 6 and 18 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice were weighed, tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, lymphocyte proliferation, antibodies, grip strength and behaviour in an open field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTS treatment resulted in a 50% decrease in splenocyte proliferation to ConA, LPS and a disease specific antigen, beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I, and in a significant decrease in serum antibody levels against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> and grip strength were normalized and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and postmortem lymph node and spleen weights were significantly reduced in FTS treated MRL/lpr mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that modulation of Ras activation has a significant impact on the MRL/lpr model and may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
