<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is believed to be caused by antiphospholipid beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2GPI)-dependent Abs or anti-beta2GPI Abs by themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a hexapeptide phage display library, we identified three hexapeptides that react specifically with the anti-beta2GPI mAbs ILA-1, ILA-3, and H-3, which cause endothelial cell activation and induce experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To enhance the binding of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to the corresponding mAbs, the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were lengthened to correspond with the site of the beta2GPI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> being recognized by these mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, the following three <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were prepared: A, NTLKTPRVGGC, which binds to ILA-1 mAb; B, KDKATFGCHDGC, which binds to ILA-3 mAb; and C, CATLRVYKGG, which binds to H-3 mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> A, B, and C specifically inhibit both in vitro and in vivo the biological functions of the corresponding anti-beta2GPI mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of endothelial cells to anti-beta2GPI mAbs and their corresponding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> led to the inhibition of endothelial cell activation, as shown by decreased expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo infusion of each of the anti-beta2GPI mAbs into BALB/c mice, followed by administration of the corresponding specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, prevented the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-treated mice from developing experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that focus on neutralization of pathogenic anti-beta2GPI Abs represents a possible new therapeutic approach to APS </plain></SENT>
