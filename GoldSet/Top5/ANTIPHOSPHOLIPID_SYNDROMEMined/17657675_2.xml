<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We describe a family with a 7-year-old proband case diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) plus secondary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) as well as two affected paternal aunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of these polymorphisms with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in this familial case of APS and SLE and the possible association of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) -675 4G/5G and PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare the genotype frequency of these polymorphisms with the results found in a Mexican Mestizo population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PAI-1 -675 4G/5G and PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys were determined by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique using Bsl I and Mwo I on four generations of the family studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism was also determined in 50 healthy individuals of Mexican Mestizo origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The family pedigree demonstrated that this family did not follow a Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism was examined, we found that 60% (3/5) of the relatives homozygous to Ser(413)/Ser were affected with SLE and/or APS (p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proband case was 4G/5G genotype for the PAI-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences between healthy controls of the Mexican Mestizo population and the family studied for the PAI-2 Ser(413)/Cys polymorphism or PAI-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphisms were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that this family did not follow the Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Ser(413)/Ser genotype demonstrated in 60% of the affected members (3/5) of this family might increase the risk for autoimmune syndromes such as APS or SLE </plain></SENT>
