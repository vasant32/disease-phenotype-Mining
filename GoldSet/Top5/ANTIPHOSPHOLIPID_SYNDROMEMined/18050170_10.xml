<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients were referred with CPN features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in CPN, we measured serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex (anti-PS/PT) antibodies, and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (anti-beta(2)GPI/CL) antibodies in the 16 CPN patients, 8 microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients, 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients, and 23 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAC was determined according to the Subcommittee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">Phospholipid</z:chebi> Dependent Antibody guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-PS/PT, aCL, and anti-beta(2)GPI/CL antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-PS/PT antibodies and/or LAC were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CPN patients, but not in any controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum IgM anti-PS/PT antibody was found in 13 (81.3%) CPN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD serum anti-PS/PT IgM level (19.9 +/- 12.4 units/ml) in CPN patients was significantly elevated compared with SLE patients (5.7 +/- 5.9 units/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-PS/PT antibody was detected in 5 (31.3%) CPN patients, but not in any controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IgG PS/PT antibody titers were similar in CPN patients (12.3 +/- 12.0 units/ml) and SLE patients (13.8 +/- 14.3 units/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three (18.8%) CPN patients were positive for IgG aCL antibody and 2 (12.5%) for IgM aCL antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No MPA patients had aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CPN skin manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (14 [87.5%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) revealed C3 within the affected vessels in 7 (77.8%) of 9 CPN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that presence of anti-PS/PT antibodies and/or LAC could serve as markers in CPN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CPN could be dependently associated with the presence of anti-PS/PT antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Clinicians need to recognize these titers to permit early accurate diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We believe that anti-PS/PT antibodies will become widely recognized as a new factor when diagnosing CPN </plain></SENT>
