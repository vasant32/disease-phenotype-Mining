<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral obliterating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> characterized by aortoiliac steno-occlusion occurring in young women, is reported in the literature under the name of Small Aorta Syndrome (SAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it remains unclear whether SAS represents a separate entity, the small size of the distal aorta increases the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortoiliac occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 41-year old white woman was admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> digital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the left foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (61 UI/mL), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> and anti-ds-DNA antibodies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She previously had two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e> of the legs and, despite the oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, abdominal angio-magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the infra-renal aorta was narrowed more than 50%, without thrombotic occlusion of the terminal aorta and common iliac arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings were compatible with the features of SAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no atherosclerotic changes in the artery wall and no other prediposing risk factors such as smoking, oral contraceptive or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adequate anticoagulation and intravenous prostacyclin treatment the patient's symptoms and the ischemic lesions improved markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report of the association of SAS and primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of SAS in patients with APS may dramatically increase the risk of trombothic events </plain></SENT>
