<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APE and antibodies, defined as the laboratory criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) -<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies were measured in 270 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (234 venous and 37 arterial) and 236 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APE were found in 15% of thrombotic patients compared to 3% of controls (p &lt; 0.001) with no predominant isotype, no association with the main known clinical or biological risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> neither with a type of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, arterial or venous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression analysis of antibodies, aPE showed the highest association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR]: 4.2, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using a multivariate analysis in a case-control subgroup study on 158 patients, IgGaPE were found to be significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR:6;p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 25 of the 40 aPE-positive patients (63%) were negative for the APS laboratory criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most of them (21/25) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, recurrent in ten of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients also suffered from early or late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results underline the strength of the association between the presence of aPE and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and suggest their measurement in thrombotic patients, especially when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin or anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies are absent </plain></SENT>
