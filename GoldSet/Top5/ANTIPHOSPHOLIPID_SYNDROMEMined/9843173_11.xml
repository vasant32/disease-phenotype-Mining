<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This relation is called the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well recognized that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> related aPL are not directed against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> alone, but to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bound plasma proteins like beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPL that need beta2GPI for the binding to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> are called anti-beta2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, a mutation in the gene encoding beta2GPI has been described, which results in an amino acid substitution Trp316 into Ser316 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This Ser316-beta2GPI did not bind to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bound beta2GPI is recognized by human anti-beta2GPI-antibodies, it might be argued that individuals carrying the Trp316Ser mutation are protected against the development of anti-beta2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis, the prevalence of the Trp316Ser mutation was measured in 170 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients and in 18 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and the mutation was correlated with the presence of anti-beta2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the total patient group 1 homozygous patient and 21 heterozygous patients were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of the mutation in SLE patients with anti-beta2GPI-antibodies (0.063) was comparable to that found in SLE patients without anti-beta2GPI-antibodies (0.062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the heterozygous presence of Trp316Ser mutation does not prevent an individual from developing anti-beta2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We showed that this can be explained by the concentration of Trp316-beta2GPI in heterozygous patients, which is far above the minimal beta2GPI level necessary for optimal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our single patient homozygous for the Trp316Ser mutation no binding beta2GPI to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface was detected and no anti-beta2GPI-antibodies were present in the plasma of this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, heterozygous Trp316Ser beta2GPI persons are not protected against the development of anti-beta2GPI-antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To confirm that homozygotes do not develop anti-beta2GPI-antibodies a very large population is needed, due to the relatively low prevalence of the mutation </plain></SENT>
