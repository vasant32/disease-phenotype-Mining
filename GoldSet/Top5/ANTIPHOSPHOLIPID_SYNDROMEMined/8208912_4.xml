<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the 90 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp90) is notably elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients with active neuro-psychiatric (NP) and/or cardio-respiratory (CR) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This elevation is dependent upon enhanced transcription of the hsp90 beta gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial studies have shown that changes in hsp90 levels have a high level of sensitivity for changes in activity of NP, CR, haematological and renal SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now present evidence that overexpression of hsp90 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients is associated with the presence of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, and with the absence of the HLA allo-/haplotypes most commonly found in this particular cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the upregulation of hsp90 expression in SLE has a genetic basis, and that this may be directly involved in pathogenesis in subsets of patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
