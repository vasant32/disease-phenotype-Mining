<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody-positive patients using the 2006 revised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A descriptive study of 200 aPL-positive patients identified in a local, hospital-based registry, analysing demographic, clinical and aPL characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were analysed for (1) fulfillment of the 1999 original (Sapporo) and 2006 revised APS classification criteria; (2) non-criteria aPL features (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aPL-positive patients, based on the 2006 revised criteria definitions); and (3) non-aPL <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk factors at the time of the clinical events (for patients with APS, based on the 2006 revised criteria stratifications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 200 patients, 183 patients had sufficient data for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 39 (21%) patients did not meet the laboratory requirement of the original 1999 criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 81 patients with APS who met the 1999 classification criteria, 47 (58%) also met the 2006 revised criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 63 asymptomatic (no vascular or pregnancy events) aPL-positive patients who met the laboratory requirement of the 1999 classification criteria, 38 (60%) also met the laboratory requirement of the 2006 revised criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of the patients with APS with vascular events had identifiable non-aPL <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk factors at the time of clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only 59% of the patients meeting the 1999 APS Sapporo classification criteria met the 2006 APS classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The revised criteria will have positive implications in APS research by way of limiting the inclusion of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients and also by way of providing a risk-stratified approach </plain></SENT>
