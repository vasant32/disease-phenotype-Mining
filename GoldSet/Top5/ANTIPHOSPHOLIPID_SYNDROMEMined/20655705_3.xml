<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the angiogenic potential of β2GPI in vivo in β2GPI deficient mice utilizing angiogenic assays. β2GPI deficient mice show increased microvessel formation in comparison to β2GPI replete controls when injected with growth factor free-matrigel implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, microvessel formation in matrigel plugs of β2GPI deficient mice was less than in β2GPI replete mice when basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was included in the matrigel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> content was higher in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) containing-matrigel plugs in the β2GPI deficient mouse demonstrating that the lack of β2GPI led to increased extravasation by VEGF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>Melanoma</z:hpo> microvessel density was increased in β2GPI deficient mice but the proliferation rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells (determined by Ki67 immunohistochemistry) was unaffected by the presence or absence of β2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous delivery of native human β2GPI by the ALZET osmotic pump did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> in β2GPI deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the in vivo unopposed action of β2GPI is anti-angiogenic however this function is modified in the presence of a strong angiogenic stimulus into stabilization of vessel formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of β2GPI attenuates vessel sprouting in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, no survival benefit is conferred to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> bearing animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This does not preclude the potential benefit of modified or fragments of β2GPI in anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> research </plain></SENT>
