<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was our objective to test whether the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> increases with: 1). increasing titres of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) after adjustment for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and 2). the number of aPL detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a cross-sectional study, blood was collected from clinics in two teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 208 individuals suspected of having an aPL and 208 age- and sex-matched controls having blood drawn for a complete blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables included history of previous arterial (ATE) or venous (VTE) thrombotic events, traditional risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory variables included IgG/IgM aCL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and IgG/IgM anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 46.5 years and 83% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five of the 416 participants had &gt;or= 1 aPL, and 69 had confirmed &gt;or= 1 ATE or VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family history was positive in 48% of participants, smoking in 28%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 16%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 6%, and SLE in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 10-unit increase in aCL IgG titre was associated with an odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] of 1.07 [1.01-1.13] for ATE and 1.06 [1.02-1.11] for VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds of a previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> increased with each additional aPL detected: 1.5 [0.93-2.3] for ATE and 1.7 [1.1-2.5] for VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that increased titres of aCL and multiple aPL were associated with an increased risk of a previous thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
