<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The antigen specificity of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> (IM) was studied using ELISA for the detection of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI), anti-annexin V, anti-protein S and anti-prothrombin antibodies and TLC immunostaining for the detection of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique enabled us to look at antibodies reacting to 'pure' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antigens in the absence of protein contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 46 patients with IM, 18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 21 with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome (PAPS), 50 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> and 30 healthy blood donors were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study highlights anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in patients with IM as specific 'pure' anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, while in PAPS and SLE patients anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> antibodies were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This investigation also shows that the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies found in IM can be present with anti-cofactor protein antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher prevalence of anti-cofactor antibodies found in IM sera than in Helicobacter pylori sera may be due to the immunostimulatory effect and/or the polyclonal activation often observed in course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, anti-beta2-GPI and, to a lesser extent, anti-prothrombin antibodies occur with a significantly lower prevalence in IM than in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that these antibodies should be regarded as the expression of the broad autoimmune syndrome involving the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins </plain></SENT>
