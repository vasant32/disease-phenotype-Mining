<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate a clinical role of soluble (s) CD40 ligand in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A serum concentration of sCD40 ligand was measured with enzyme immunoassay (Bender Medsystems, Austria) in 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), in 25 patients with secondary APS (SAPS) associated with SLE, in 92 SLE patients and in 16 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A sCD40 ligand concentration in sera of SAPS and SLE patients was significantly higher than in donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant differences by the ligand level between the above patients were not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PAPS sCD40 ligand concentration was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum concentration of the ligand was observed in 9.5% patients with PAPS, 54.0%--with SAPS, 73.9%--with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This rise in SLE and SAPS was not related with the disease activity or renal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperexpression of the ligand in APS was associated neither with thromboses nor with a high concentration of IgG/IgM antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation occurred between sCD40 ligand level and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In SLE and SAPS elevation of the ligand level correlated with increased thickness of carotid artery intima-media complex, hypercholesterinemia and diastolic dysfunction of left ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hyperexpression of sCD40L in SLE and SAPS is associated with developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
