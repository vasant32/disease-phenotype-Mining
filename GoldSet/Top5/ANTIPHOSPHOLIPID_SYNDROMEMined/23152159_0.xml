<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some IgG samples from these patients activate endothelial cells (EC) in vitro as judged by surface expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules such as E-selectin, which can promote <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial microparticles (EMP), which themselves are potentially prothrombotic, are released by activated EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though elevated circulating EMP levels have been reported in patients with APS, it is not known whether these EMP are released due to a direct effect of aPL on the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of purified polyclonal IgG from patients with APS (APS-IgG) and healthy controls (HC-IgG) upon cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HUVEC exposed to APS-IgG produced significantly more EMP than those exposed to HC-IgG (p=0.0036) and a greater proportion of these EMP carried surface E-selectin (6.2% ± 4.0 for APS-IgG vs. 3.4% ± 2.0 for HC IgG, p=0.0172) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study therefore demonstrates that purified polyclonal APS-IgG can drive EMP release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that EMP generation may be a useful measure of aPL-mediated pathogenic effects upon EC </plain></SENT>
