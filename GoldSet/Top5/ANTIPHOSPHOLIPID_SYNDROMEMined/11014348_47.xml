<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association of autoantibodies against prothrombin with the clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 265 patients who visited our <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM antiprothrombin antibodies were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as either antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex (aPS/PT) antibodies or as antibodies against prothrombin coated on irradiated ELISA plates (as antigen) (aPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG, IgM, and IgA anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and their beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) dependency were also evaluated by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LAC was tested by 3 different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of aPS/PT, but not of aPT, significantly correlated with the clinical manifestations of APS (odds ratio [OR] 4.39, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.06-9.38), and aPS/PT antibodies were as specific as beta2GPI-dependent aCL for APS (93.1% for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG aPS/PT strongly correlated with the presence of LAC as detected using the dilute Russell viper venom time test (OR 38.2, 95% CI 13.4-109.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antiprothrombin antibodies are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and their clinical relevance depends on the method of detection applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Positive results on the aPS/PT test can serve as a marker of thrombotic events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
