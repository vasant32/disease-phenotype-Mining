<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied 83 Caucasoid patients with APS and two groups of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNFalpha levels were determined in plasma from 35 patients' and 21 controls using a highly sensitive sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The full patient group was genotyped together with 95 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>-308 and -238 TNFA promoter polymorphisms were assessed by ARMS-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-DQB1, DQA1 and DRB1 genotypes were determined by PCR using sequence specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNFalpha levels were significantly higher in patients with APS than healthy controls (median 2.95 pg/ml [range 0.51-10.75] vs. 0.95 pg/ml [0.51-1.6], respectively; p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of TNFA-308*2 genotype did not differ between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TNFA-238*A positive genotype was more frequent in APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy loss than in controls (OR 3.7 [95% CI 1.37-10.1], p = 0.007 and OR 3.95 [95% CI 1.3-11.7], p = 0.01; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DQB1*0303-DRB1*0701 haplotype was associated with TNFA-238*A in the control group (OR 96.0 [95% CI 9.6-959], p &lt;0.0001) as well as in APS patient's group (OR 54.2 [95% CI 9.6-306.5], p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Raised plasma TNFalpha levels were found in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a prothrombotic and proinflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha may be involved in the development of clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation between the TNFA-238 polymorphism and plasma levels associated with disease suggests that the TNF genetic marker may only indirectly relate to protein levels by virtue of allelic association with a functional marker which may reside in the HLA class II region </plain></SENT>
