<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and forty-five Japanese patients with SLE were studied. beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA typing of the DRB1 alleles was performed by the polymerase chain reaction sequence specific oligonucleotide probe method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL was positive in 29 (20.0%) out of 145 SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL had a significantly higher frequency or one or more of the clinical manifestations assumed to be associated with aCL, compared to those without beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DRB1*0901 was lower in SLE patients than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL were significantly associated with DRB1*0901 as compared to those without beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL (41.4% vs 15.5%, p &lt; 0.005, R.R. = 3.8), although the corrected P value was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A possible association of DRB1*0901 with Japanese SLE patients with beta 2 GPI-dependent aCL was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association indicates an association between the disease and the HLA-DR53 (DRB4)-bearing haplotypes in different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
