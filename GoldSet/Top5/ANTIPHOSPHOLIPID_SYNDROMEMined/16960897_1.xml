<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and to evaluate the association of these antibodies with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or other clinical characteristics of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four patients with RA and 82 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 84 (8.3%) patients were positive for aCL, six out of 84 (7.2%) for anti-beta(2)GPI, and six out of 84 (7.2%) for aPT, while in controls the overall prevalence of aPL antibodies was 3.6% (3 out of 82) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found aPL antibodies in 19.1% (16 out of 84) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and this prevalence was statistically higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
