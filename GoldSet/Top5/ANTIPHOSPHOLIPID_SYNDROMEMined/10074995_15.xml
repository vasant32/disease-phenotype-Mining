<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess maternal and fetal outcomes in 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (19 pregnancies) treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Monthly IV Ig therapy was initiated in the first or early second trimester of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnancies except two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional therapy consisted of low-dose aspirin and subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients also received steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial anticardiolipin IgG levels were measured in eight pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The live-birth rate was 84% (16 of 19 live births), and there were three pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of fetal growth restriction (FGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">Preeclampsia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nonreassuring fetal status</z:e> were each diagnosed in 25% of the pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five percent of the infants were delivered at 34 weeks' gestation or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin IgG decreased throughout the course of therapy in seven pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Placental pathology was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pregnancy complications</z:e> appear to be minimized with the use of IV Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Definitive recommendations regarding the use of IV Ig in pregnancy await the conclusion of randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>If the combination of IV Ig, aspirin, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly decreases the incidences of FGR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, it may be a cost-effective primary therapy for pregnancies complicated by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
