<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in this field may be misleading as the antigen coating density using mutant forms of beta(2)-GPI may be below the threshold required for monogamous divalent binding by low affinity anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies, while being easily detected by high affinity anti-beta(2)-GPI from immunized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antigen density threshold effect is found in anti-beta(2)-GPI autoantibodies from humans and from monoclonal anti-beta(2)-GPI derived from mice with models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI from an autoimmune mouse and from 18/21 human sera did not bind above background levels to a domain-I-deleted mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, single point mutations in domain I result in dramatic changes in the binding of many human sera containing anti-beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support a conclusion that domain I of beta(2)-GPI contains significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for the anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
