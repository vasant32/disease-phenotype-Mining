<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation has been suggested to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemostatic disorders</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, but no association with neuro-PAPS has been investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated 16 patients with PAPS by flow cytometry in the presence of circulating activated platelets as defined by the surface expression of activation-dependent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> CD62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationship among activated platelets and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects CD62 was found significantly increased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a significantly increased percentage of CD62-positive platelets was found in the neuro-PAPS group (nine patients) compared to the non-neuro-PAPS patients (seven subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, no significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to aCL IgG and platelet number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, within the neuro-PAPS group, no difference was evidenced, in the CD62-positive platelet percentage, between the four subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and the five with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, neuro-PAPS subjects with previous peripheral arterial and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> did not show a significantly more elevated level of CD62-positive platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a linear correlation was found between the aCL IgG level and the CD62-positive platelet percentage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and, more significantly, in the neuro-PAPS group, but not within the non-neuro-PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that circulating activated platelets are detectable by flow cytometry in the majority of PAPS patients and suggest the existence of a relationship among activated platelets, aCL, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> that patients affected by PAPS might undergo </plain></SENT>
