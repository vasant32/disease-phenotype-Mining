<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two main groups: I those who remained well without any further thromboembolic complications (n = 10); II those who developed recurrent thrombotic events in the five year period (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up to determine the relation between the level or the isotype of the anticardiolipin antibodies, or both, to the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and the effect of a variety of treatments (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, immunosuppression, anticoagulation) in the prevention of further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For some patients in group II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> seemed to occur at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> remained positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the levels remaining fairly constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels fell in only one patient in group I and in two in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in group II had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> related disease than those in group I; most were receiving concomitant steroid and immunosuppressive therapy, but this did not seem to protect against the development of further occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given anticoagulation treatment (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> (low dose aspirin 75 mg daily), or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep vein thromboses</z:e> developed more complications during anticoagulation therapy than those with cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Problems in anticoagulation control and recurrent thromboses consequent on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> withdrawal despite the administration of subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were responsible for complications in most patients in group II </plain></SENT>
