<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with APS who were attending our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> unit and who presented with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> while receiving oral anticoagulation were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was defined by the need for admission to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical features, concomitant diseases and drugs, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> doses, duration of anticoagulation, and International Normalised Ratios (INR) at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the study (12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) plus APS and 3 with primary APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 41.7 (range 27-66) and the median duration of the disease was 12.9 years (range 3-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of anticoagulation was between 10 days and 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The INR at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was under 3 in 4 patients, between 3 and 4 in 5 patients and above 4 in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 4 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo>, 4 episodes of renal haematoma (two after renal biopsy), 2 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1696704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian haemorrhage</z:e>, 2 episodes of rectal haemorrhage, 1 episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo>, 1 episode of haemarthrosis, and 1 episode of spinal haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitant drugs were aspirin in 9 patients, antibiotics in 2 patients, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present as a concomitant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was restarted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 3 of them had a new episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No relation was established between age, duration of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Concomitant drugs, mainly aspirin, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> were present at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in a large number of patients </plain></SENT>
