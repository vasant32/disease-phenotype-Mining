<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Two approaches for detecting anti-prothrombin antibodies have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first detects antibodies against prothrombin alone and the second, phos-phatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter more often correlate with clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to increase the capacity of antibody binding, we modified the previously described phosphatidylser-ine-dependent antiprothrombin ELISA and determined their avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined 203 patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and 222 blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our modification resulted in a greater intensity of antibody binding to prothrombin on phosphatidylserine-coated plate surfaces compared to the previously described method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By changing ELISA conditions, we were able to detect with one assay the two, presumably different, populations of antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic specificities of both ELISAs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were similar (92.5% vs. 93.1%), while the sensitivity of the modified phosphatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin ELISA was significantly higher than the anti-prothrombin alone ELISA (59% vs. 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low avidity antiprothrombin antibodies were only detected in the modified phosphatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four percent of patients with positive phosphatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin antibodies, showing clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> increased with the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody positivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that antibodies detected with a modified phosphatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin ELISA could improve the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> by offering additional information on the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, especially in patients negative for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
