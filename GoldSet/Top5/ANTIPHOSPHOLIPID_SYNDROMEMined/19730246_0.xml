<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accurate assessment of the autoantibodies in plasma is very important since the autoantibodies can lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to define the inhibitors causing reduced clotting activity in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipids antibodies</z:hpo> and to assess the potential of thrombin generation assay to assist in establishment of optimal treatment in case of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of clotting factors as well as inhibitors to factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For detection of inhibitors to prothrombin crossed immunoelectrophoresis was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG was purified by commercial protein A column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation was measured using a fluorometric assay in platelet-poor and platelet-rich plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors toward the activity of factors V, VII, VIII, IX, X and XI were defined and also an inhibitor to prothrombin antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No thrombin generation was induced in the patient's plasma by recalcification even in the presence of recombinant factor VIIa or factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, addition of platelets from either donor or patient or synthetic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> normalized the thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thrombin generation model showed that the addition of platelets and no recombinant factor VIIa or factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity would correct thrombin generation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On this basis, platelet concentrates were administered to a patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and low clotting factors activity </plain></SENT>
