<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic criteria for a familial form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS), identify families with &gt;1 affected member, examine possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo>, and determine linkage to potential candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Family members of probands with primary APS were analyzed for clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Families with &gt; or =2 affected members were analyzed by segregation analysis and typed for candidate genetic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven families were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty of 101 family members met diagnostic criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Segregation studies rejected both environmental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> models, and the data were best fit by either a dominant or codominant model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis showed independent segregation of APS and several candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory criteria are essential to identify the spectrum of disease associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe a set of criteria was developed that can precisely define affected family members with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modeling studies utilizing these criteria strongly support a genetic basis for disease in families with APS and suggest that a susceptibility gene is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in these families, APS was not linked with HLA, Fas, or other candidate genes, including beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1, HLA, T cell receptor beta chain, Ig heavy chain, antithrombin III, Fas ligand, factor V, complement factor H, IgK, and Fas </plain></SENT>
