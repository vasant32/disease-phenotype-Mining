<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To document the clinical association between the history of pregnancy loss in patients with the diagnosis of primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and the presence of different antiprothrombin antibody subtypes [immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA] in a cohort of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of 170 female patients with primary APS, or APS secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or secondary to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In female APS patients with IgG antiprothrombin antibodies (n = 105) significant associations to pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.0001), early pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.0001) and a negative association to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with IgG antiprothrombin antibodies and at least one pregnancy (n = 84) a significant association with pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.005) and especially with early pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.0001) was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No association with other immunoglobulin subtypes of antiprothrombin antibodies could be documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of patients with primary APS and at least one pregnancy in the history, pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.005) and early pregnancy loss (p &lt; 0.0001) were found to be highly associated with the presence of IgG antiprothrombin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG antiprothrombin antibodies represent the highest independent risk factor for pregnancy loss with an odds ratio of 4.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant association with venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IgG antiprothrombin antibody positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study document the association of IgG antiprothrombin antibodies with pregnancy loss and in particular early pregnancy loss in a large and well-characterized cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We would recommend routine testing for antiprothrombin antibodies in young female patients with APS </plain></SENT>
