<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many of them the stimulation by a specific autoantigen is claimed to be responsible for the initiation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, an autoimmune state may be induced by a pure dysregulation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such is the case in which severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) is induced in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis following thymectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have referred to this set of events as the 'kaleidoscope of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herewith, we would like to present another example of the kaleidoscope phenomenon, namely: the emergence of a full blown clinical presentation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS-recurrent thromboembolic phenomena, repeated fetal loss with high titers of anti-cardiolipid antibodies) in a 32 y old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis, two years following thymectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thymectomy in myasthenic patients may be associated with the emergence of new autoimmune conditions such as SLE and APS, pointing to the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> in the induction of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
