<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of both beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) and aPLs on the activity of extrinsic fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) of the sample consisting of beta2-GPI, two-chain recombinant t-PA, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) -1 was measured by a chromogenic assay using synthetic substrate S-2251, Glu-plasminogen, and soluble fibrin monomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Without PAI-1, beta2-GPI did not affect t-PA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 14.3 ng/ml PAI-1 was added to 3.6 U/ml t-PA, the remaining t-PA activity was increased from 48.9% to 60.4% by the addition of beta2-GPI (190 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of beta2-GPI did not require <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beta2-GPI seems to protect t-PA activity from the inhibition by PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs), EY1C8, and EY2C9, which were established from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, were further added to the mixture with a diluted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (Platelin) to investigate the influence of aPL, the remaining t-PA activity decreased to 50.1 and 80.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal aCLs appeared to inhibit the effect of beta2-GPI, that is, these monoclonals inhibited the fibrinolytic activity by an elevation in PAI-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility that the impairment of fibrinolytic activity by aCLs is one of reasons for the increased incidence in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with aCLs </plain></SENT>
