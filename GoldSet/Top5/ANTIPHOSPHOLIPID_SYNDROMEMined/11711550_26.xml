<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma protein beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) is the primary antigen recognized by the circulating autoantibodies in patients with the "anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome" (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is routinely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of APS patients, the primary <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding site within beta2-GPI has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More importantly, how <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> exerts its beneficial effects in vivo in APS patients has not been deduced at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an expression/site-directed mutagenesis approach, we now show that the positively charged site that resides in the first domain of beta2-GPI is not the primary <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather it is the second positively charged site located within the fifth domain of the protein that also binds to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lys(284), Lys(286), and Lys(287) in this domain are essential for the interaction of beta2-GPI with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that beta2-GPI binds to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in a relatively specific manner even though the affinity for the interaction is rather low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lys(317) resides in the center of the high affinity <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at concentrations that can be achieved in vivo during anticoagulation therapy greatly enhances the plasmin-mediated cleavage of the Lys(317)-Thr(318) site in beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the cleaved form cannot bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> effectively, the combined actions of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and plasmin result in a diminished ability of beta2-GPI to recognize <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, decreases the prothrombotic activity of the endogenous circulating anti-beta2-GPI antibodies in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> exerts its beneficial effects in APS patients by at least two distinct mechanisms </plain></SENT>
