<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Activated protein C resistance is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> that predisposes to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperestrogenism</z:e> strongly increases the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other thrombophilic disorders, such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome, probably mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0002551'>abnormal clotting</z:mp> in the placental circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this series is to present clinical and laboratory data on individuals with a poor obstetric history and activated protein C resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Within an 18-month period seven patients with more than five early pregnancy losses, recurrent intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo>, and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> in association with activated protein C resistance came to our attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis was made by activated protein C ratios, and molecular diagnoses of activated protein C resistance genotypes were made by polymerase chain reaction for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an extensive diagnostic workup for known etiologies of the above complications and other thrombophilic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had activated protein C ratios &lt;1.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients were heterozygous for the Leiden mutation, and one patient was homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A personal or family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was present in one case and three cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic workup was otherwise unrevealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One newborn was diagnosed of bilateral renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> on day 1 of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Activated protein C resistance was found in association with extremely poor obstetric outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A family or personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was suggestive in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A population-based study is needed to determine the role of activated protein C resistance in adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
