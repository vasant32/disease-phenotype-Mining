<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to analyze the risk factors, clinical course and outcomes in these 16 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ages of the patients varied from 29 to 39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four women had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE), 3 of which after caesarean section (C/S) at 35 to 40 weeks, and one case after ovarian cystectomy at 13 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), 4 of which during pregnancy, and the remaining 8 cases after C/S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients who had DVT during a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> course of pregnancy had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and antithrombin (AT) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> with or without AT and had healthy babies via successful vaginal deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common risk factors in 3 cases of PE with C/S was prolonged bed rest due to threatened <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature delivery</z:hpo> with total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placenta previa</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042133" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="UL">uterine myoma</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the case of the ovarian cystectomy had only one risk factor, which was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This patient died but the remaining patients recovered with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because of the low incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the Japanese population, prophylactic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy has not routinely been given to patients undergoing obstetrical operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, proper management including prophylactic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy might be considered for risk patients, depending on the risk factors </plain></SENT>
