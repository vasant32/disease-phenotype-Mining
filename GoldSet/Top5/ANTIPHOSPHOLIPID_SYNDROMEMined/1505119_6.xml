<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta 2-GPI is a single chain, 50 kd <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> made up of 326 amino-acids, present in human plasma at concentrations of about 200 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to represent the "serum cofactor" important in determining the binding of aCL to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> both in fluid and in solid phase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its cofactor activity is demonstrable for aPL antibodies from patients with autoimmune but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is immunogenic in heterospecific models, and immunization with beta 2-GPI seems to be able to induce the production not only of anti-beta 2-GPI but also of aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most probably its binding to CL changes the configuration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> to a more immunogenic one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The various characteristics of beta 2-GPI are summarized in Table I. beta 2-GPI has been recognized as a natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein, but its possible role in the pathogenesis of the APLS remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
