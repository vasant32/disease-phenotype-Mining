<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An echocardiography demonstrated mitral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo>, which caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> could be observed, serological investigations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and started on a treatment of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the treatment, the pleural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> went into complete remission, indicating that the serositis related to SLE had overlapped the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since there was no evidence of any other diseases that could be responsible for the valvular lesions, we concluded that they were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> had no significant effect on valvular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> or function as demonstrated by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When patients with valvular disease are seen, a valvulopathy related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
