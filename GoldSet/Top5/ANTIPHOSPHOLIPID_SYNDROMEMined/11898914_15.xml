<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 28 patients with SLE, 10 patients with PAPS, and 24 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEGF plasma levels were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunolocalization of VEGF was done in renal tissue from SLE patients and cadaveric controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that VEGF plasma levels were increased in SLE patients compared with PAPS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between clinical manifestations and VEGF levels revealed that SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> had significantly increased plasma VEGF levels (134.1 + 91.0 pg/ml) compared with SLE patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function (42.9 + 19.0 pg/ml), PAPS patients (41.9 + 26.6 pg/ml), and controls (36.2 + 27.0 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining showed a strong expression of VEGF in SLE renal tissue samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results indicate that VEGF is increased in plasma from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and a moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and is overexpressed in renal tissue from these patients </plain></SENT>
