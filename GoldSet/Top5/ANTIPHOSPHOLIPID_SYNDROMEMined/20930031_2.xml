<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, patients with gamma-HCD are so rare that no more than 150 cases can be found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report one additional case: an 83-year-old man with a gamma-HCD, in whom a kappa light chain component was detected in the serum by using the serum free light-chain assessment and in addition monoclonal kappa cytoplasmic expression was detected in bone marrow plasma cells by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the work-up of the patient, the underlying anatomopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> corresponded to a lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, as it is stated in the current World Health Organization classification (2008), with both lymphadenopathic and bone marrow infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in other cases, several autoimmune manifestations (antiphospholipidic syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) were present during the course of the disease in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case report illustrates a new case of gamma-HCD, in which serum free light-chain analysis and flow cytometry represented a valuable tool for diagnosis, a finding that could be very important for the future management of these patients </plain></SENT>
