<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the lower limbs and the pelvic region (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) in patients with positive AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six patients (48 female, 18 male) with positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and/or positive anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) underwent radionuclide (RN) venography with 370 MBq of 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy was performed in 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had positive LA and positive aCL (LA+/aCL+), 33 patients had positive LA only (LA+/ aCL-) and 18 patients had positive aCL only (LA-/aCL+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>43 patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and 19 were diagnosed with APS associated with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DVT was detected in 21 of 66 patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with LA+/aCL+ showed higher prevalence of DVT (53%) as compared to LA+/aCL- (27%) and LA-/aCL+ (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PE was found in 13 of 58 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of PE was higher in patients with positive aCL (33% in LA+/aCL+; 36% in LA-/aCL+) than in patients with negative aCL (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of the high prevalence of DVT and PE in patients with AA, RN scintigraphy must be recommended in screening for these clinical troubles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the prevalence of DVT and PE may vary in subgroups of AA </plain></SENT>
