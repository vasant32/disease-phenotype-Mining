<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS is the cause of obstetrical problems in the form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">EPH gestosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms described above are probably mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> which interact with endothelial and trophoblastic cells, blood platelets, embryonic tissue cells, as well as with coagulation factors and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade or in antibody binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of APS includes antiaggregation, anticoagulation, immunosuppression, and intravenous administration of gamma globulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment is not always the case and search for more efficient therapies continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The importance of animal experiments led to the design at the Department of Pathology of Pregnancy and Labour of an APS model in pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As Turowski et al. have confirmed the immunomodulating action of TFX in rabbits, it seemed justified to examine the properties of this preparation in pregnant rabbits with experimentally induced APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The material consisted of 30 pregnant New Zealand rabbits, divided into the following groups: I--10 pregnant rabbits (and 63 fetuses) treated intradermally twice weekly since the 10th day of pregnancy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> together with adjuvant; I-K--5 pregnant rabbits (and 17 fetuses) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and adjuvant in the same manner as group I and additionally with intramuscular injections of 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd day; I-T--10 pregnant rabbits (and 66 fetuses) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> with adjuvant in the same manner as group I and additionally with intramuscular injections of 10 mg/day of TFX (Jelfa, Poland) on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd day of pregnancy; K--5 pregnant rabbits (and 27 fetuses) treated with injections of 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> twice weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for laboratory analysis were collected by cardiac puncture before immunization (sample I) and on the day of caesarean section (sample II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts and APTT tests were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Numbers of live and dead newborns, resorbed fetuses, body mass, newborn viability and survival rates were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TFX administered to pregnant rabbits with experimentally induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> increased the number of live newborns, reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e>, increased the viability and survival rate of newborn rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of TFX on APTT and platelet count was revealed, such that these parameters remained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range despite immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes observed in the placenta were not specific </plain></SENT>
