<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate which serologic and clinical findings predict adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) and to test the hypothesis that a pattern of clinical and serologic variables can identify women at highest risk of adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women enrolled in a multicenter prospective observational study of risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with aPL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [LAC], anticardiolipin antibody [aCL], and/or antibody to β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I [anti-β2 GPI]) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were recruited for the present prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, serologic, and treatment data were recorded at the time of the first study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between individual and combined variables and adverse pregnancy outcome was assessed by bivariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2011 we enrolled 144 pregnant patients, of whom 28 had adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine percent of the patients with LAC had adverse pregnancy outcome, compared to 3% of those who did not have LAC (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among women with IgG aCL at a level of ≥40 units/ml, only 8% of those who were LAC negative had adverse pregnancy outcome, compared to 43% of those who were LAC positive (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgM aCL, IgG anti-β2 GPI, and IgM anti-β2 GPI did not predict adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, adverse pregnancy outcome occurred in 52% of patients with and 13% of patients without prior <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P=0.00005), and in 23% with SLE versus 17% without SLE (not significant); SLE was a predictor in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prior pregnancy loss did not predict adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous positivity for aCL, anti-β2 GPI, and LAC did not predict adverse pregnancy outcome better than did positivity for LAC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LAC is the primary predictor of adverse pregnancy outcome after 12 weeks' gestation in aPL-associated pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibody and anti-β2 GPI, if LAC is not also present, do not predict adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
