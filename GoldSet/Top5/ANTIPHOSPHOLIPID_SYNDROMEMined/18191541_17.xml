<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antinucleosome antibodies (anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) are reported to be highly sensitive and specific for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and to correlate with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may appear in early stages of the disease, in particular before anti-dsDNA antibodies, being a potential marker for identifying patients susceptible to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) may develop full-blown SLE but there is no evidence for markers predictive for that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate whether anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> may be predictors for full-blown or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> like disease (LL) in a cohort of PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicentric cohort of 105 PAPS patients was tested for IgG/IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> by using a home made assay with H1-stripped chromatin as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-one out of 105 (77%) of the patients were positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>; medium-high titre results were present only in 49/105 (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> were more frequently detected in PAPS+LL, but no relationship with clinical/serological features was found, except for a weak correlation with anti-dsDNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two PAPS patients evolved into full-blown SLE during the follow-up and displayed high titre anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> many years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> might be added to the mosaic of autoimmune phenomena characterizing PAPS patients and in particular those with more chance to evolve to SLE </plain></SENT>
