<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>Cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> has been reported infrequently in patients with APS and is one potential means of blood vessel injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine if autoimmune aPL antibodies and their target antigens contribute to the formation of cryoprecipitates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cryoglobulins were identified and isolated from 5 of 8 patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using identical concentrations of immunoglobulins isolated from matched sera and washed cryoprecipitates there was a significant enrichment (at least 100%) of aCL antibodies in the cryoprecipitates from 4 of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This involved IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes with specificity for both beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (GPI) and prothrombin (PT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The target antigens were detected in cryoprecipitates from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 aPL positive patients and in cryoprecipitates from 3 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that anti-beta2-GPI and anti-PT antibodies in association with their target antigens are integrally involved in the formation of cryoprecipitates in patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies and provide insight into a potential mechanism for blood vessel injury </plain></SENT>
