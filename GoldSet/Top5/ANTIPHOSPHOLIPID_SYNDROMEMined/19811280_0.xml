<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI-reactive T cells are clearly implicated in the generation of these AAb, but the mechanism responsible for their activation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that immunization of mice with human beta2GPI, in the context of a potent innate immune activator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), would generate not only high titers of anti-PL AAb, but also a strong beta2GPI-specific T cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy, nonautoimmune C57BL/6 mice were immunized repeatedly with human beta2GPI in the presence of LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High titers of anti-PL to beta2GPI appeared after the second immunization, with T cell reactivity to beta2GPI detectable only after the fourth immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenic T cells from these mice proliferated in response to native beta2GPI, alone or bound to anionic PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These T cells produced IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but not IL-4 or IL-10, indicating a Th1 bias of the beta2GPI-specific response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that T cells responsive to beta2GPI may become activated in APS patients by exposure to their cognate Ag in the context of innate immune activation and a pro-inflammatory environment </plain></SENT>
