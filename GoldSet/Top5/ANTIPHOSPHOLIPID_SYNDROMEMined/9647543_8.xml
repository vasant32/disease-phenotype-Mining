<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible association between the presence of circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (namely the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies), among a series of 21 consecutive IVF patients having a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> after their first embryo transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a control group (n=42), the nearest IVF cycle resulting in an ongoing pregnancy before and after each miscarried IVF cycle (i.e. the closest cycles in temporal relationship to the index cycle) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient (4.8%) in the study group and two women (4.8%) among controls were seropositive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These low and similar seropositivity rates found in the two groups studied lead us to conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> testing in IVF patients should be considered only in those women having repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001728'>failures of implantation</z:mp>/clinical abortion after embryo transfer but not in an <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> general population reaching an IVF programme </plain></SENT>
