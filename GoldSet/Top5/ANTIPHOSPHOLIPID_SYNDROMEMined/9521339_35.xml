<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) entails a prothrombotic state associated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aCL were shown to promote endothelial cell and platelet activation and to induce an APS-like syndrome in mice when administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that aCL target the plasma cofactor beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) rather than negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been determined whether different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-specific anti-beta2GPI antibodies obtained from one patient possess pathogenic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three beta2GPI-binding IgM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (ILA-1, ILA-3, and ILA-4) were cloned from a patient with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three antibodies were shown to bind beta2GPI immobilized on irradiated plates, yet only ILA-1 bound beta2GPI coated onto nonirradiated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when using the anti-beta2GPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ILA-1 was the only mAb inhibited by fluid phase beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ILA-1 and ILA-3, but not ILA-4, induced adherence of U937 cells to endothelial cells in vitro (reflecting activation of endothelial cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mAbs ILA-1 and ILA-3 as opposed to ILA-4 induced significant expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules when preincubated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Passive administration of ILA-1 and ILA-3 to pregnant BALB/c mice induced clinical findings consistent with APS (increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>reduced platelet counts</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo>), whereas both ILA-4 and the control human IgM did not produce similar effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate the differential effects of various populations of anti-beta2GPI antibodies on endothelial cell activation and on experimental APS </plain></SENT>
