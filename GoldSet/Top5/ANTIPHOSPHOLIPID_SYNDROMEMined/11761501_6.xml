<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the causes, complications, and histological appearance of nonbacterial thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (NBTE) in a surgical population compared with those in previously reported autopsy series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were identified by reviewing the surgical pathology reports for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiac valvular specimens removed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., between 1985 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Archived microscopic slides and medical records were reviewed for each study patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group consisted of 30 patients (20 female and 10 male), with a mean age of 49 years (range, 15-89 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 30 patients, 28 had single valve involvement (19 mitral, 8 aortic, and 1 tricuspid), and 2 had involvement of both their mitral and aortic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An underlying immune-mediated disorder was identified in 18 patients (60%), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (in 8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (in 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (in 2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (in 2), 15 (83%) of whom were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 12 patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, only 5 (42%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic malignant disease</z:e> or disseminated intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic embolization was documented in 10 patients (33%), 8 of whom had cerebral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valvular vegetations were visualized by echocardiography before surgery in 8 patients and were suspected but not confirmed preoperatively in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> vegetations consisted primarily of platelets and fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The site and appearance of vegetations did not vary with the underlying disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously reported autopsy series, NBTE in a surgical population was more commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> or disseminated intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Women were affected twice as often as men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Systemic embolization, particularly to the brain, was prominent in both surgical and autopsy series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Vegetations had a similar appearance regardless of the specific underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>An antemortem diagnosis of NBTE in a patient with no known risk factors should prompt a search not only for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">occult malignancy</z:e>, as suggested by autopsy studies, but also for autoimmune or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, particularly the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
