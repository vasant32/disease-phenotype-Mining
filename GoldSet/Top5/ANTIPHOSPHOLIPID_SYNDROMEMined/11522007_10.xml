<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of mAbs displaying LA activity for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As most patient samples contain both beta2Glycoprotein I (beta2GP1) and prothrombin dependent LA, a combination of two mAbs, one of each specificity, was added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma in a concentration from 0 to 60 microg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight assay systems using different reagents and instruments were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calibration curves were linear for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one, with marked differences between the responsiveness to each mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A panel of plasmas from 69 patients with persistent LA diagnosed using the SSC-ISTH criteria was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) was present in 40, whereas 29 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA activities of individual plasmas varied between assays (p &lt; 10(-4)), but homogeneous subgroups were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a majority of samples, LA activity displayed a prothrombin-dependent profile, with a variable contribution of beta2GP1-dependent activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter was associated to beta2GP1 antibodies detected by solid-phase immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By using 3 dilute Russell viper venom time assays, higher LA titers were found in APS, compared to asymptomatic patients (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
