<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who underwent renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the posttransplant clinical course and renal biopsy results in 97 consecutive SLE patients who underwent a total of 106 renal transplantation procedures at our center from January 1984 to September 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 81 female and 16 male patients, with a mean age of 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of dialysis prior to transplantation was 33.5 months; 9 patients were never dialyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the disease was clinically and serologically quiescent at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean posttransplantation followup period was 62.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a total of 143 posttransplant biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had pathologic evidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of the patients with recurrence had cadaveric grafts, 2 had living-related grafts, and 1 had a living-unrelated graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred an average of 3.1 years after transplantation; the longest interval was 9.3 years and the shortest, 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic diagnoses on recurrence included diffuse proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, focal proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, membranous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, and mesangial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> contributed to graft loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients with recurrence had serologic evidence of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, but only 1 had symptoms of active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients who lost their grafts secondary to recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> underwent second renal transplantation procedures and had functioning grafts at 7, 30, and 35 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the largest single medical center series of renal transplant patients with SLE, recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> was more common than reported in the literature, but was not always associated with allograft loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> was often present in the absence of clinical and serologic evidence of active SLE </plain></SENT>
