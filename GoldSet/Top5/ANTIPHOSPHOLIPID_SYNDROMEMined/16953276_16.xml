<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Women with unexplained obstetric complications and no definite autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), IgG/IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and IgG/IgM anti-human beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) antibodies and diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in classification category I on the basis of more than one laboratory criteria present in any combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristics at the time of diagnosis and risk factors for subsequent clinical events during a mean follow-up of 6.3 years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three of 600 women studied were found to fulfil obstetric criteria and had more than one positive laboratory test at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the women were aCL and abeta2GPI positive, and 16 were also LA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This latter group (triple positivity) had distinct features and had more frequently experienced previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (OR = 122.5, 95% CI 16-957, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also had an increased rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> loss (OR = 16.2, 95%CI 0.9-292, p = 0.01), and a higher IgG abeta2GPI titer at diagnosis (median, 25(th) and 75(th) percentile were 118, 37-962, vs. 23, 18-32, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the group of women with triple positivity and/ or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (OR = 57.5, 95% CI 2.7-1160, p = 0.0004) which were the only independent predictors of TE in the multivariate model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Triple positivity and/or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were again the only independent markers (OR = 34.4, 95% CI 3.5-335.1, p = 0.003) of an unsuccessful new pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in primary APS with pregnancy morbidity in classification category I, quite different groups of patients may be identified on the basis of laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Triple positivity and/or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> predict new TE events and new unsuccessful pregnancies </plain></SENT>
