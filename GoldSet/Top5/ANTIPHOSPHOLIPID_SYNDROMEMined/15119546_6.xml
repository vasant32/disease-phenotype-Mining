<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This makes differentiation between primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> a difficult task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in murine models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> have shown that the development of antinucleosome (anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) antibodies may occur from the early stages of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesize that anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies could help predict development of SLE in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies in 18 PAPS patients (15 female, three male), followed for a mean of 11 years to evaluate the potential development of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When PAPS was diagnosed, nine patients were positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of them developed clinical manifestations of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the patients who were negative to anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies developed it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies could help predict which patients with PAPS may eventually develop SLE </plain></SENT>
