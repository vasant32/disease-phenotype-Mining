<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The obstetric manifestations of APAS include early or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses and complications like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and fetal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its timely diagnosis and treatment can improve maternal and neonatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aims: To study the pregnancy outcome of patients with APAS treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of pregnancy outcome in 42 consecutive women with APAS, treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The case records of 42 diagnosed cases of APAS with pregnancy, over a 3-year period, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy outcome in this group was compared before and after treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin in terms of abortions, intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and live birth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the present pregnancy in terms of fetal and maternal complications was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age and average parity of women with APAS were 30.1±4.1 years and 3.2±1.2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the treated patients of APAS, 13 (30.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and 9 (21.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (IUGR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 2 (4.7%) intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 4 (9.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">missed abortions</z:e> and 3 (7.1%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>abruptio placentae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women with APAS had a live birth rate of 4.6% before treatment and 85.7% in the index pregnancy after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment of pregnant women with APAS results in marked improvement in the live birth rate (4.6-85.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, complications like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and IUGR occur even after treatment, requiring strict monitoring and timely delivery </plain></SENT>
