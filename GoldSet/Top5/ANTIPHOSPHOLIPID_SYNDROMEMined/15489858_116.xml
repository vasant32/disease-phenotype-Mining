<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because complement activation is essential and causative in aPL antibody-induced fetal injury, we hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> protects pregnant APS patients from complications through inhibition of complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (unfractionated or low molecular weight) prevented complement activation in vivo and in vitro and protected mice from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> induced by aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither fondaparinux nor hirudin, other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, inhibited the generation of complement split products or prevented pregnancy loss, demonstrating that anticoagulation therapy is insufficient protection against APS-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> prevent obstetrical complications in women with APS because they block activation of complement induced by aPL antibodies targeted to decidual tissues, rather than by their <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
