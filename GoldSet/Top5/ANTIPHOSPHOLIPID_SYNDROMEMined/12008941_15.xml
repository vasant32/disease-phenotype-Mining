<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin (ACA), anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI), and antiprothrombin antibodies of IgG and IgM classes were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 176 untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients across the histopathological spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Positivity rates ranged from 21% (IgG ACA) to 30% (IgM anti-prothrombin) versus 4% in healthy controls (p &lt;10(-2) to 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgM anti-beta2GPI and IgG ACA were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lepromatous leprosy</z:e> and multibacillary patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG3 was the most common subclass reactive to both beta2GPI and prothrombin in selected high-titer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> sera, unlike antibodies from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) largely restricted to IgG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients, but not in the APS control group, there was no statistical correlation between ACA and anti-beta2GPI antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, a large fraction of anti-beta2GPI positive sera (36/45 and 28/44 for IgG and IgM, respectively) were unreactive in the standard ACA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most assayed anti-beta2GPI antibodies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients showed (i) ability to recognize both human and bovine beta2GPI immobilized on non-irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates, (ii) concentration-dependent inhibition of binding by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, and (iii) relatively high avidity binding to fluid-phase beta2GPI, thereby differing from those found in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the location of the major epitopic region on the beta2GPI molecule targeted by autoantibodies was different in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> and APS, as assessed by direct binding to domain I- and V-deleted mutants and competition with the mouse monoclonal antibody 8C3, directed at domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> comprise persistent IgG and IgM anti-beta2GPI that differ from APS-related ones with respect to IgG subclass, avidity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity, possibly reflecting distinct pathophysiological significance </plain></SENT>
