<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events involve venous and arterial circulation, including unusual locations, such as cerebral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, intra-abdominal thromboembolic occlusions and microvascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients will have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, but a significant number have no identifiable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of treatment consists of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, although some patients appear to benefit from the addition of immunomodulatory therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other disorders that share this thrombotic storm phenotype include catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and similar aggressive clinical disorders </plain></SENT>
