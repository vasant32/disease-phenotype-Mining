<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the association of HLA Class I, II, and III alleles with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, both in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied Caucasian patients with SLE (n = 91) and with primary APS (n = 16) followed at the Ottawa General Hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatic Disease</z:e> Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) were defined by a positive IgG anticardiolipin antibody by serum ELISA and/or the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA Class I by serology and Class II by restriction fragment length polymorphism were compared in patients with and without serum aPL, and in patients with primary APS compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C4A null alleles were studied in patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aPL were found in 19 of 91 (21%) patients with SLE, and were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with primary APS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and recurrent fetal loss were the most common clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR17(3) and Dw24 were decreased in patients with SLE with aPL and in patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR4 and the linked DR53 were significantly increased in patients with primary APS compared to patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with aPL (SLE and primary APS) compared to patients with SLE without aPL, associations were found with HLA-DR53 (p = 1.5 x 10(-4), RR 5.1), DR7 (p = 0.01, RR 5.6), and to a slightly lesser degree DQ7 (p = 0.005, RR 3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C4A null alleles by protein allotyping and the C4A gene deletion were not associated with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirm the association of aPL with HLA Class II alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The strongest association with aPL in our study is with the HLA-DR53 haplotypes, some of which include the DQ7 allele, as suggested in an earlier study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B8, DR17, DQ2 haplotype so closely associated with SLE is significantly decreased in both patients with aPL and with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>C4A null alleles are not associated with primary APS in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests the aPL response in SLE and primary APS is immunogenetically distinct from SLE itself </plain></SENT>
