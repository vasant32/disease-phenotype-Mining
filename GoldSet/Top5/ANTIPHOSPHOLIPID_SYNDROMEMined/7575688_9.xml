<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmunity</z:hpo>-prone (New Zealand white x BXSB)F1 ([NZW x BXSB]F1) mice have been shown to be useful as a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the cross-reactivity of anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) derived from (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice with oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), which is closely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against CL were established from (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, and reactivity of aCL with ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was examined by micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher titers of anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> autoantibodies were found in adult (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice compared with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>-prone mouse strains (P &lt; 0.01) or a control strain (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between titers of aCL and those of anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice (r = 0.79, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 MAb against CL, 2 clones that showed beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1-dependent reactivity also cross-reacted with ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of monoclonal aCL to solid-phase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was inhibited by ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, but not by native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirmed that aCL derived from (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice can cross-react with ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that aCL, which is closely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, may also play an important role in atherosclerotic complications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
