<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical history of well-documented personal or familial episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with systematic construction of a genealogical tree orients the diagnosis of hereditary or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of favorable medical or surgical conditions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (surgical operation, prolonged bed rest, oral contraception, pregnancy, etc) are commonly observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young age, under 40, at the time of the first episode, the recurrent nature of thromboses and a positive family history are three criteria in favour of the diagnosis of hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests should be performed, if possible <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, or taking into account its effect on the results, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> reducing the antithrombin level and the oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> those of proteins C and S and affecting the "classical" test of resistance to activated protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This abnormality is observed in nearly 20% of patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> whereas it is twice less common in deficits of antithrombin, protein C and protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other more or less acknowledged causes, alteration of plasminogen, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenaemia</z:hpo>, homocysteinaemia, particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood diseases</z:e>, indicating systematic association of a full blood count with blood clotting tests, are much more rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, the commonest is the presence of circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or anticardiolipine antibodies, these two conditions also requiring systematic investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biological examinations for determining the cause of unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> is essential but should not delay instauring treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be associated with a familial enquiry if the patient has a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="?"><plain>Interpretation of the results should obey the rule of the 3 cs: is the biological abnormality the cause, a coincidence or the consequence of the affection </plain></SENT>
