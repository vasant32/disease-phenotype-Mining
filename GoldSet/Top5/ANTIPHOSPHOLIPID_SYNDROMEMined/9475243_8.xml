<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the significance of determination of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, clinical and laboratory findings were compared between patients whose sera were positive for these antibodies (Group A) and non-positive patients (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody (aCL) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) was determined by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboplastin time inhibition test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 27 cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> belonged to Group A and 3 of the 7 were confirmed to have anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG)-positive cells were more frequent in Group A than in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was difficult to discriminate APS from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> alone, when there were no symptoms or signs of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, measurement of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was thought to be useful for the differential diagnosis of APS and subsequently for the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
