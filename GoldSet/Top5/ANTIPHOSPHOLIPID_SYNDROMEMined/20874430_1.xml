<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical significance with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of laboratory findings of a-β2GP1 with events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or obstetric complications (pregnancy loss, <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental dysfunction</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo>) in women with clinical and laboratory evidence of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one patients (total 394 pregnancies) referred to a tertiary medical center for evaluation of clinical features consistent with APS were divided into three groups: group A (n = 34), two positive tests for anticardiolipin (ACL) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), in accordance with original APS classification (1998); group B (n = 18), two positive tests for a-β2GP1, in accordance with the revised APS criteria; and group C (n = 39), only one positive test for ACL or LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 52 women with APS (group A or B), 36 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e>, and 16 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On comparison of the groups, group B was characterized by a significantly higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancy</z:e> (83.3%) than groups A (47.1%) and C (76.9%), P = 0.007, and a higher rate of fetal loss (72.2%) than groups A + C (28.8%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the revised APS criteria are preferable to the original classification for the prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
