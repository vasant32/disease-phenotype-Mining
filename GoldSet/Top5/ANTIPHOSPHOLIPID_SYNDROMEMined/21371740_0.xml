<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis of relative <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> resistance in thrombotic PAPS and the effect of baseline IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> CYP2C9 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28371">vitamin K epoxide</z:chebi> reductase (VKORC1) haplotypes we compared weekly <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> consumption of 40 TPAPS (mean age 44 ± 16years) with that of 65 thrombotic patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (IT) (mean age 52 ± 18) at similar target INR 2.0-3.0 followed up between January-1994 and January 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate an involvement of the epoxidation pathway in this difference and to assess enhanced residual fibrin turnover decarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II) and D-dimers (DD) were cross-sectionally investigated in the same patients between March and May 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CEX7 and VKORC1 polymorphisms explained 45.1% of the variability in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> consumption, whose age-adjusted mean weekly consumption was greater in PAPS than IT (27.62 vs 21.24 mg, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PAPS baseline IgG aCL and VKORC1 predicted weekly <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> consumption (p = 0.028 and p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG β(2)GPI and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> dose independently predicted plasma PIVKA-II (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age and sex adjusted DD was greater in PAPS than IT (132 ± 34 vs 83 ± 37 mg/dl, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic PAPS exhibit a degree of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> resistance partly accounted by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and are in a state of enhanced fibrin turnover despite oral anticoagulation that might have implications for re-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
