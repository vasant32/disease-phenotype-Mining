<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to factor XII (FXIIabs) have also been identified in some patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factor XII (FXII) is a member of the kringle family of proteins which include plasminogen and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to prothrombin have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and have been shown to cross react with plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with APS and FXIIabs were investigated for the presence of antibodies to prothrombin, by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in a calcium (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+) independent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sixteen showed different antibody binding patterns than those observed for antibodies to FXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were further investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for antibody binding to covalently bound FXII and to covalently bound prothrombin in both <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ dependent and independent systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of three patients demonstrating antibody binding to FXII by SPR, none demonstrated antibody binding to prothrombin in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ independent system with one demonstrating antibody binding to prothrombin that was <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of five patients who did not bind FXII by SPR, one demonstrated antibody binding to prothrombin in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ independent system while two demonstrated antibody binding to prothrombin in a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ dependent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to FXII in patients with APS appear to be distinct from antibodies to prothrombin </plain></SENT>
