<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To fulfill diagnostic criteria, patients must have thrombotic or obstetrical morbidity and consistently positive antiphospholipid testing on two occasions separated by at least 12 weeks [2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other clinical manifestations include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is thought to be primarily due to the presence of autoantibodies directed against platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, although platelet activation and aggregation by APS-associated antibodies have also been implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in patients with APS is typically moderate in severity with platelet counts remaining greater than 50,000 cells/mm3 in most cases,so therapy is often unnecessary </plain></SENT>
