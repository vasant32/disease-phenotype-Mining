<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were measured by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the baseline serum samples of patients enrolled in a Cooperative Study of Systematic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rheumatic Diseases</z:e> (CSSRD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported, 5-year inception-cohort, prospective study of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA, n = 70), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE, n = 70), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>, n = 45), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (PM/DM, n = 36), and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> (EUCTD, n = 165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on standardized criteria and determined at the last study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nested group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SJ, n = 44) was also defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum from 200 blood donors (BB) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS, n = 33) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>-related renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, n = 52) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory personnel were blinded to sample diagnostic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of either IgG or IgM aCL among each diagnostic group was RA 15.7%, SLE 15.76%, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi> 6.7%, PM/DM 8.3%, EUCTD 9.1%, SJ 6.8%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> 3.8%, and BB controls 4.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of aCL was significantly different for both the RA and SLE groups versus BB controls (P &lt; 0.01) but not among other diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 study patients had positive tests for IgA aCL (1 with PM/DM and 1 with EUCTD) versus 15% of APS with positive IgA aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Study patients positive for IgG or IgM aCL were significantly more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> or a positive serologic test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> and less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no associations were found between aCL positivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, presence of a positive antinuclear antibody or rheumatoid factor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001482'>subcutaneous nodules</z:hpo> or digital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on results from this large CSSRD inception cohort, anticardiolipin antibodies are present in approximately 16% of patients with RA or SLE but are less common in patients with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53277">PSS</z:chebi>, PM/DM, EUCTD, SJ, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, where their prevalence approaches that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Few consistent clinical association can be found among patients with CTD who are aCL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The complete diagnostic and prognostic importance and specificity of these antibodies remains to be fully determined </plain></SENT>
