<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this report we present an unusual case of a 45-year-old female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who was hospitalized for mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In her childhood she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> on which grounds a preliminary diagnosis of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a quiescent period lasting two decades <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> erupted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, thromboembolic phenomena, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to severe malfunctioning of her mitral valve, the patient eventually underwent mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies involved in the pathogenesis of our patient's valvular disease were studied by immunohistochemical analysis, applying rabbit polyclonal anti-human IgG and IgM anti-human C3c and anti-idiotypes to a mouse monoclonal naturally occurring polyspecific human monoclonal anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody termed S2.9, and to the 16/6 Id which defines a common Id on anti-DNA antibodies in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoperoxidase staining using an anti-idiotype mAb to anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies demonstrated the deposition of these anti-bodies in the subendothelial layer of the valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) with SLE was the initial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings clearly indicate that APS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, particularly in young female patients who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
