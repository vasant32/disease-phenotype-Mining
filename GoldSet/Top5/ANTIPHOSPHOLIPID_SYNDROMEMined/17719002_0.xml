<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vis-NIR spectra from 90 plasma samples [anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPLs)-positive group, n=48; aPLs-negative group, n=42] were subjected to principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) to develop multivariate models to discriminate between aPLs-positive and aPLs-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and SIMCA models were further assessed by the prediction of 84 masked other determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> model predicted successful discrimination of the masked samples with respect to aPLs-positive and aPLs-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SIMCA model predicted 42 of 48 (87.5%) aPLs-positive patients and 33 of 36 (91.7%) aPLs-negative patients of Vis-NIR spectra from masked samples correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis could provide a promising tool to objectively diagnose APS </plain></SENT>
