<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of this investigation demonstrate beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression by human peripheral blood monocytes, indicating that these cells synthesize beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show beta2-GPI expression on cell surface of these cells by flow cytometric analysis, and the presence of this protein in cell lysate by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, beta2-GPI expression on monocytes is significantly increased in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) as against healthy blood donors and correlates with tissue factor expression on monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings support the view that monocytes are able to synthesize beta2-GPI and suggest that patients with APS may have increased beta2-GPI exposure on cell surface, which leads to persistently high monocyte tissue factor expression and consequently to a prothrombotic diathesis </plain></SENT>
