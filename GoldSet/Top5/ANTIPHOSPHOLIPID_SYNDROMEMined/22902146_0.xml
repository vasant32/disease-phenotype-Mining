<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the risk factors and clinical outcomes of pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen pregnant patients with a diagnosis of CVT were followed in the neurology unit between 2009 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and with CVT secondary to invasive procedures were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 19 pregnant women ranging in age from 18 to 38 years (mean 27.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 11 to 24 months (mean 19 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and signs that suggested a rise in intracranial pressure were present nearly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>) were present in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of CVT was higher in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most commonly affected cerebral sinuses in our patients, and parenchymal involvement was present in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no maternal mortality, and 20 infants were still alive and healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: If magnetic resonance imaging is available, it should be used for the detection of CVT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnant patients instead of computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with parenchymal lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> had a greater risk of being left with neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For pregnant patients with CVT, low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in full <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> doses should be continued throughout the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy did not appear to predispose patients to further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
