<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flair sequence allowed to detect 18 additional hypersignal (HS) that were not present on T2 sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These HS were located in the periventricular areas for 5 of them, near the cortical sulci in 10, and in the centrum semi-ovale for 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FLAIR sequence permitted analyze 41 other lesions that were not obvious on proton density sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty five of them were thus confirmed to be HS : 31 in the paracortical areas, 3 in the paraventricular regions and one in the internal capsule, whereas the remaining 6 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sulci of the brain </plain></SENT>
