<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and premature or accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the study were: a) evaluate myocardial perfusion in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> by means of contrast echocardiography (CE) and to establish its usefulness as compared to the results obtained by nuclear medicine (NM) (reference method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>b) evaluate the prevalence of alterations in subclinical myocardial perfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and to establish a strategy to evaluate the cardiovascular changes in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion in 37 outpatients of the rheumatology department was evaluated by CE at rest and with pharmacological stress (dobutamine) and NM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of alterations in the myocardial perfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> by CE and NM, when these methods were analyzed independently or when both methods were used was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive value (NPV) of both tests was 80% and 93%, respectively, the sensitivity was 80% and the specificity was 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of alterations of perfusion in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) was of 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this patients it was found that when both diagnostic tests are performed, NM reaches a sensitivity of 100% if the CE is positive and an specificity of 100% when the CE is negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that it is important to determine the presence of subclinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> by noninvasive studies such as Sestamibi SPECT and/or CE for assessment of myocardial perfusion in order to plan an adequate treatment and follow-up </plain></SENT>
