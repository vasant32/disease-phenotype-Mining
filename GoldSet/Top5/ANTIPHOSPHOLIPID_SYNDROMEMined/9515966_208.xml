<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the structure and function of membrane domains in the vacuolar apparatus of animal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unique feature of late endosomes, which are part of the pathway that leads to lysosomes, is that they contain a complex system of poorly characterized internal membranes in their lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These endosomes are therefore known as multivesicular or multilamellar organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some proteins distribute preferentially within these internal membranes, whereas others are exclusively localized to the organelle's limiting membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The composition and function of this membrane system are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that these internal membranes contain large amounts of a unique <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, and thus form specialized domains within endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These specialized domains are involved in sorting the multifunctional receptor for insulin-like growth factor 2 and ligands bearing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17369">mannose-6-phosphate</z:chebi>, in particular lysosomal enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also show that this unique <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> is a specific antigen for human antibodies associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These antibodies may act intracellularly by altering the protein-sorting functions of endosomes </plain></SENT>
