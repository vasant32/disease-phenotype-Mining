<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lung perfusion scintigraphy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33371">99Tc</z:chebi>(m)-macroaggregated albumin was performed in 31 patients (SLE = 7; SLE + APS = 14; PAPS = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The seven patients with SLE alone and the 10 patients with PAPS had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion lung scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the 14 SLE + APS patients showed a segmental uptake defect on multi-view perfusion scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SLE + APS patients were found to have a higher risk of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> than the SLE alone and primary APS patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest that lung perfusion scintigraphy should be performed routinely in these patients, even in the absence of pulmonary clinical manifestations, to obtain baseline data for disease outcome and management </plain></SENT>
