<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bovine beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI) was purified by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi> ion-exchange chromatography, and identified on immunoblots using a monoclonal antibody against human beta 2-GPI and by amino acid sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aB beta 2-GPI levels in the sera from 36 APS patients were measured by ELISA using purified bovine beta 2-GPI as an antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- standard deviation level of aB beta 2-GPI was 17.4 +/- 22.0 units in the 58% of APS patients who were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation (P = 0.003) between aB beta 2-GPI and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>aB beta 2-GPI from the sera of patients with APS was inhibited by bovine beta 2-GPI itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Purified IgG from the sera of patients with APS showed that bovine beta 2-GPI was capable of acting as a cofactor for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Purified bovine beta 2-GPI was useful antigen for conventional ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>aB beta 2-GPI may contribute to the further development of aCL analysis and to the understanding of the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
