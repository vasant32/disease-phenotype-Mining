<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> associated with recurrent arterial and venous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart valve abnormalities are commonly found in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1998 to March 2007, nine patients with APS underwent heart valve surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their clinical data, operative and postoperative courses and the long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 43.6+/-10.4 years, six were female and three male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent mitral valve replacement, three went through aortic valve replacement, one underwent combined mitral-aortic valve replacement and another aortic valve plasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The syndrome was primary in seven patients and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 8 days to 8 years (median 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died in the early postoperative period: both due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients presented an uneventful late postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced an ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 5 years after mitral valve replacement (MVR) and developed refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> requiring heart transplantation three years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heart valve surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> may carry considerable early and late mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thrombo-embolic complications are the most common complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mechanical prostheses have been used at our Institution in the previous years; however, today, after reviewing our historical results, we reconsider our general strategy and believe that tissue heart valve prostheses are the possible ideal substitutes, minimising the risks of morbidity and mortality due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> of APS </plain></SENT>
