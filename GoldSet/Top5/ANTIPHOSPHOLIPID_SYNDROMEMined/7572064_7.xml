<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have collected blood samples at entry from one hundred patients (53 men and 47 women), mean age 67.4 years, referred within 6 h of a first-ever non-hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and from an equal number of age- and gender-matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were &gt; or = 10 GPL in 26 patients and in 5 controls (p &lt; 0.0001, X2 test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression analysis, increase of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies remained independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.0034), together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.0009) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (p = 0.0238) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the occurrence of elevation of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients should antedate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and might be a risk factor per se </plain></SENT>
