<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of vitamins in pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> (VIP) trial database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: A total of 2399 women at increased risk of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> in 25 UK hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An analysis of a large prospectively validated database of high-risk women in the UK was undertaken to assess aspirin use across different risk groups and to evaluate the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> in 370 women who developed pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was employed to compare drug use between region and by recognised clinical indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Usage of aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the women with known risk factors at trial entry, 24% (569/2399) received low-dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin usage varied widely between risk groups [from 5% (19/378) in women with multiple pregnancy to 94% (50/53) in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>] and between geographical regions [from 8% (20/248) to 49% (95/193)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and seventy women developed pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, 52% (n = 193) of whom received new or additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> after 20 weeks of gestation; 34% (77/224) with a maximum recorded systolic blood pressure of &gt;OR=160 mmHg in the second half of pregnancy did not receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment; 17% (62/370) of women with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> prophylactically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic and treatment regimes for pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> in the UK vary by region and risk group </plain></SENT>
