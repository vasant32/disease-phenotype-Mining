<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of antibodies against the N-terminal domain of annexin A2 (ANXA2) in primary APS (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the 31N-terminal amino acids of ANXA2 (ANXA2(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36825">N31</z:chebi>)) as an antigen, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure anti-ANXA2(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36825">N31</z:chebi>) IgG and IgM antibodies in the serum of PAPS patients (n=19), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients (n=50) and healthy blood donors (n=106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not find any statistically differences between the three groups in terms of IgG and IgM anti-ANXA2(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36825">N31</z:chebi>) titres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated IgG anti-ANXA2(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36825">N31</z:chebi>) titres were not observed in the serum of PAPS or SLE patients who had previously tested positive for anti-ANXA2 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the ANXA2 N-terminal domain does not appear to be the target antigen for anti-ANXA2 antibodies in APS </plain></SENT>
