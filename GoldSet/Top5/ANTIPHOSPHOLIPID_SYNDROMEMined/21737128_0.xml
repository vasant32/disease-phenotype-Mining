<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> may recur in up to 30% of patients with a spontaneous venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after a standard course of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of patients at risk for recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> would facilitate decisions concerning the duration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this exploratory study, we investigated whether whole blood gene expression data could distinguish subjects with single venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> from subjects with recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 40 adults with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (23 with single event and 17 with recurrent events) on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma and serum samples were collected for biomarker testing, and PAXgene tubes were used to collect whole blood <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, but P-selectin and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison of gene expression data from the two groups provided us with a 50 gene probe model that distinguished these two groups with good receiver operating curve characteristics (AUC 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model includes genes involved in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing and platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis between subjects with single and recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> revealed that the Akt pathway was up-regulated in the recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> group compared to the single venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, gene expression profiles of whole blood appear to be a useful strategy to distinguish subjects with single venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> from those with recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies with additional patients are needed to validate these results </plain></SENT>
