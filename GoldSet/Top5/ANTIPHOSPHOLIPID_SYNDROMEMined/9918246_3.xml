<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two patients (73 female, 19 male) with positive LAC and/or aCL were included as 2 groups: (1) 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (16 had thrombotic episodes and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>); (2) 72 patients with primary APS (31 presented thrombotic episodes and 41 had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Group 1 seven of 20 (35%) patients with secondary APS had IgG aCL, 9 (45%) had both IgG/IgM aCL, and 2 (10%) had IgM aCL; the remaining patients had combinations of aCL isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group 2 patients with primary APS, IgG aCL was positive in 41%, IgG/IgM mixture in 21%, and 15% of patients had combinations of the 3 isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 20 (80%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> and 37 of 72 (51%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> tested positive for LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of one or any mixture of isotype of aCL with or without LAC is not associated with the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (venous or arterial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, in the patients with primary APS, the presence of the 3 aCL isotypes plus LAC was associated with a higher number of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> compared to other possible combinations of aCL isotypes </plain></SENT>
