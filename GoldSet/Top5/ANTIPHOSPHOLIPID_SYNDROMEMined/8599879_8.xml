<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have pointed to the pathogenic role of antiphosphatidylserine (aPS) Abs by inducing an experimental model of pAPS in naive mice following passive transfer of human aPS to the tail vein of ICR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to induce experimental pAPS in mice following active immunization with aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice were immunized with IgG and IgM aPS, purified from two patients with pAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sera of the mice were examined for the presence of different antiphospholipid Abs, and the beta 2 GPI dependency of aPS, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition ELISA studies, with <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> beads coated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, were used to detect cross-reactivity of aPS or aCL to other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mice were also tested for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (APTT), and the percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The purified IgG aPS but not IgM aPS had a strong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both IgG and IgM aPS were beta 2 GPI dependent and did not bind PS in the absence of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mice immunized with IgG aPS, but not IgM aPS, developed high titers of mouse aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mice generated polyspecific Abs, cross-reacting with aCL and aPS, as well as individual aPS or aCL Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only the mice immunized with IgG aPS developed clinical parameters of pAPS: prolonged APTT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, active immunization with IgG, but not IgM, aPS induces experimental pAPS in naive mice, thus pointing to the participation of aPS in the idiotypic network </plain></SENT>
