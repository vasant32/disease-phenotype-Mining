<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin reduces the frequency of recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No universally accepted approach regarding the duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the best antithrombotic regimen for patients with APS after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 6 anticoagulation regimens used in such patients, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with APS by literature search </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decision tree was developed and the expected risks and benefits of each anticoagulation regimen were assessed at 2 different time points: at one year and again 4 years after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the decision analysis, longterm <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> alone at an international normalization ratio (INR) between 3.0 and 4.0 had the highest expected utility of the 6 antithrombotic regimens, both one year and 4 years after the initial venous thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short term anticoagulation for only 6 months is less beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) does not offer an improvement in the expected utility over <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the applicability of this analysis to clinical decision-making is not entirely clear, patients with APS presenting with DVT appear to benefit from longterm <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (INR 3.0-4.0) that may be superior to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (INR 2.0-3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Short term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy seems to be less beneficial and the use of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> does not offer a clear additional benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a better basis for recommendations for the treatment APS </plain></SENT>
