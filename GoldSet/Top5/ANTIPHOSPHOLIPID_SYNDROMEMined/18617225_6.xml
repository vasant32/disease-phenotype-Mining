<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is controversial whether PAPS patients have early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is an early event in the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aim of our study was to compare endothelial function of patients with PAPS and no associated risk factors with that of age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PAPS, carefully selected to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy, pregnancy, intake of drugs affecting endothelial function, vitamins or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi>, were included in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls were age- (+/-5 years) and sex-matched subjects with the same exclusion criteria but without PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and some plasmatic markers of endothelial and platelet activation were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measures are expressed as mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty cases (mean age 42+/-4.0 years, 11 females) and 39 controls (mean age 41+/-2.9, 22 females) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FMD was 5.7+/-0.8% in cases (95% CI: 4.1 to 7.3) and 6.8+/-0.5% (5.7 to 7.9) in controls (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor was 128+/-11.3% and 134.2+/-16.1% in cases and controls, respectively (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Soluble P-selectin and soluble CD40L were 94.1+/-4.9 ng/ml and 0.7+/-0.1 ng/ml in cases and 87.7+/-4.0 ng/ml and 1.0+/-0.2 in controls, respectively (p=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In a substudy, circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial function in patients with PAPS and no associated risk factors is similar to that of age- and sex- matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the alterations leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in PAPS concern primarily the clotting system </plain></SENT>
