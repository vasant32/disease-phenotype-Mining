<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the binding specificities and sequence analysis of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2GP-I) or anti-prothrombin (anti-PT) antibody fragments generated by phage display from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained 39 positive clones, two that had the correct size reacted with beta2GP-I (Beta 1 and Beta 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten clones with the same restrictive pattern recognized PT (Prot 1) and cross-reacted with beta2GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three clones recognized anionic and zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The V(H) regions of both anti-beta2GP-I clones are members of the VH4 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prot 1 has a V(H) segment of the VH3 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Beta 1 J(H) segments are J(H)5b and J(H)4b for Beta 2 and Prot 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>V(L) genes are V(lambda)1, 3 and 1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No J(L) was identified for Beta 1, while Beta 2 and Prot 1 carry J(lambda)3b genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Beta 1 and Beta 2 carry highly conserved germ-line V(H) and V(L) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the Prot 1 gene appear to be antigen-dependent, most are hotspot mutations located in the CDR 1 and 2 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our work suggests that some anti-beta2GP-I from patients with primary APS are natural autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our work may also help to explain the frequent coexistence of anti-beta2GP-I and anti-PT in the same patient </plain></SENT>
