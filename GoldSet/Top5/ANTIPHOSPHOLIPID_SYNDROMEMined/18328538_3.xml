<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How these antibodies behave in arterial as compared to venous TE in APS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI with clinical manifestations in category I APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven APS patients with triple positivity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) antibodies), 28 with arterial and 29 with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the dRVVT ratio, IgG/IgM aCL and IgG/IgM abeta2GPI titers in the two patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the IgG (78.5 U+/-59.8 vs. 112.2 U+/-92.3) and IgM (16.3 U+/-15.9 vs. 21.1 U+/-14.3) anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI mean values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI and IgG anti-beta2GPI titers in the whole group of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the arterial group were older and had more risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data from this study do not support the hypothesis that IgG anti-oxLDL/beta2GPI are specifically associated to arterial TE in Category I APS patients </plain></SENT>
