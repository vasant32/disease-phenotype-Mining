<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the anti-CLAbs prevalence in AIH and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether anti-CLAbs are co-factor dependent and which is their avidity since co-factor dependency or increased resistance is associated with APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine AIH patients, 228 HCV, 50 HBV, 123 with other non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and non-autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disorders</z:e> (nV-nALD) and 267 healthy people were investigated for anti-CLAbs and antibodies against beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resistance of IgG anti-CLAbs was evaluated using 2 M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-CLAbs detected in 39% of AIH, 19.7% of HCV (p=0.006), 14% of HBV (p=0.01), 8.1% of nV-nALD (p=0.000) and 1.1% of healthy (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-CLAbs were associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and active AIH while their resistance to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI was detected in two AIH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of anti-CLAbs in patients with AIH compared to other diseases and healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-CLAbs were associated with AIH stage but no association was found with APLS clinical manifestations (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pregnancy morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, their avidity was comparable with that of APLS indicating the need for prospective studies in order to address whether anti-CLAbs in AIH may contribute to the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> or APLS development </plain></SENT>
