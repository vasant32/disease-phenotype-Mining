<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pregnant women in their first trimester were screened using a two-step approach using a self-administered 10-item questionnaire and subsequent testing for rheumatic autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, anti-extractable nuclear antigen, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-Î²2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) and evaluation by a rheumatologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> evaluated included fetal loss, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo>, fetal growth restriction, delivery at less than 34 weeks, neonatal resuscitation and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 2458 women screened, the authors identified 62 (2.5%) women with previously undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> (UCTD) and 24 (0.98%) women with previously undiagnosed definite systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalences were seven (0.28%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e>, six (0.24%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, three (0.12%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and one (0.04%) for systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multiple exact logistic regression, after adjustment for potential confounders, the OR of overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complications of pregnancy</z:e> were 2.81 (95% CI 1.29 to 6.18) in women with UCTD and 4.57 (95% CI 1.57 to 13.57) in those with definite diseases, respectively, compared with asymptomatic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our population approximately 2.5% and 1% of first trimester pregnant women had a previously undiagnosed UCTD and definite systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These conditions were associated with significant negative effects on the outcome of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
