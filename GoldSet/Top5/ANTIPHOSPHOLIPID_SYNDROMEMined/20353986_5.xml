<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the evolution of clinical practice, at least in the US, also has convinced us that our field would benefit from further clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, the number of women diagnosed with 'APS', but who do not meet the revised Sapporo criteria, seems to have increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is now common practice for women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> or prior fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to be treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, even in the presence of indeterminate or low titer <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) levels and even after only one positive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In part, this common practice derives from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> on the part of many clinicians and patients regarding the diagnosis of APS as well as the clinical and laboratory criteria for the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In part, this derives from the common practice of so-called 'empiric treatment' in US reproductive medicine, often driven as much by patients as by clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This brief commentary focuses on areas of uncertainty that we see as deserving of new or renewed study for the sake of improving our understanding of APS and best patient care </plain></SENT>
