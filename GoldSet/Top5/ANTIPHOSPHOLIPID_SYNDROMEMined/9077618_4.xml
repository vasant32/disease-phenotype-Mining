<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Sera were obtained from women with clinical features associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> who had negative test results for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-like) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied (1) the effect of passive immunization with their purified immunoglobulin G fraction on murine pregnancy (n = 35) and (2) the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anticardiolipin antibodies (n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera were also retested for anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fetal loss occurred in 235 of 1088 (22%) pups in 137 mice immunized with immunoglobulin G fraction from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-like women compared with 23 of 402 (6%) pups in 53 control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G from 11 study patients resulted in the loss of at least one third of the exposed pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five women had positive levels of antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (&gt;99th percentile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> levels were low positive, and three women also had low-positive levels of anticardiolipin antibodies on repeat testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of the 11 (45%) women whose immunoglobulin G fractions caused at least 33% fetal loss also had positive test results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A subset of women with clinical disorders suspicious for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> but who had negative test results for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies by current methods have serum immunoglobulin G that is pathogenic to murine pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing for pathogenic immunoglobulin G may provide additional means to identify women with an as yet uncharacterized immune condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of low levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in these women remains unproved </plain></SENT>
