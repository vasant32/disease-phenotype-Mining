<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients with primary SS were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aPL and characteristics of the clinical and laboratory features of these patients were compared with those of the following groups of patients: (i) 50 patients with SS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE); (ii) 100 patients with SLE without SS; and (iii) 100 healthy blood donors from the blood bank of our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 11 (14%) patients with primary SS were found to have aPL (anticardiolipin antibodies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, or both) in their sera, but anti beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies were not detected in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, aPL were detected in 12 (24%) patients with SS secondary to SLE and in 21 (21%) patients with SLE without SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the healthy controls presented aPL in their sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with primary SS presented a lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) compared with the other two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with primary SS was diagnosed as having an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), while 4 (8%) patients with secondary SS and 9 (9%) with SLE without SS were found to have APS (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with primary SS, aPL are present in a lower percentage than in patients with SS secondary to SLE or in patients with SLE without SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPL in these primary SS patients is not associated with the clinical events of APS </plain></SENT>
