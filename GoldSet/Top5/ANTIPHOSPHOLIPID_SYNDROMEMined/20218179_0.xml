<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerning the tests the search for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> is now better defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A modified antibeta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I assay has been shown to be more specific for clinical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems necessary to still perform anticardiolipin antibodies in case of pregnancy morbidity but not in case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> which raises the question of two separate clinical entities with different pathologic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concerning the pathophysiology, new data emphasize the role of complement and underscore the role of genetic predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data of some large cohort followed prospectively such as the European cohort (1000 APS patients) as well the data of some registries (APS in children and patients with a catastrophic APS) bring some new important information on the clinical aspects of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally this review will propose some algorithms to treat patients with APS </plain></SENT>
