<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence and clinical correlations of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> autoantibodies in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 118 patients with SLE, 78 with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), 27 with primary APS, 2 with HIT (as positive controls) and 47 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>-dependent and -independent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies were measured with an ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding was confirmed to be <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-dependent when inhibited by the presence of a high concentration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibody was assessed by <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>-dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in 11 SLE (9%) and 2 primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (3%) patients, but at much lower levels than in HIT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-release assays, only the HIT sera induced platelet activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>-independent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in 17 SLE patients (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the levels of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-dependent and -independent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity between these two antibodies was not detectable by ELISA competitive assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>-dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and IgM aCLs (P = 0.007 for both comparisons), while <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-independent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibody levels were correlated with SLE disease activity index (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the SLE patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies had previous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> is an autoimmune target in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
