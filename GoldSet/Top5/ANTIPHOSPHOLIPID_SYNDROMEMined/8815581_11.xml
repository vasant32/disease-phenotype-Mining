<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study has been undertaken to assess whether anticardiolipin and anti-beta 2-GPI are two distinct populations of (auto)antibodies, and to clarify whether the beta 2-GPI region critical for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding is also crucial for anti-beta 2-GPI reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 62 anticardiolipin (aCL) ELISA positive sera (22.6%) were positive for anti-beta 2-GPI by immunoblotting, 42 (67.7%) for aCL using TLC immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG fractions from 5 sera gave the same anticardiolipin reactivity detected by TLC immunostaining in the corresponding sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anti-beta 2-GPI-positive sera were reactive with the phenylthiocarbamyl derivative of the protein, indicating that binding of phenylisothiocyanate with lysine residues does not modify the molecule antigenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, incubation of IgG fractions with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site did not modify reactivity with beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that: a) "true" <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are detectable in patients' sera; b) aCL and anti-beta 2-GPI have a different immunological profile; c) the beta 2-GPI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site is not the region recognized by the antibodies </plain></SENT>
