<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 62 patients with APS, 88 with recurrent pregnancy loss, 50 healthy blood donors, and 24 women with one or more successful pregnancies, we measured antiphosphatidic acid (aPA), antiphosphatidyl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> (aPC), antiphosphatidylethanolamine (aPE), antiphosphatidylglycerol (aPG), antiphosphatidylinositol (aPI), and antiphosphatidyl-serine (aPS) IgG and IgM antibodies from 2 manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We computed the areas under the curve (AUC), sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values, and 95% confidence intervals to assess diagnostic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AUC analyses of the IgM assays demonstrated significant differences (P &lt; .01) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers except aPC, whereas the IgG markers showed comparable performance for most assays with the exception of aPE (P &lt; .01) and aPS (P = .02) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, the combined sensitivity of the aPL assays differed significantly between manufacturers and did not improve the diagnostic yield for APS </plain></SENT>
