<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, I studied on the involvement of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI) and anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies in apoptotic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By flowcytometric analysis, I demonstrated that beta 2-GPI could bind to a human T cell line, Jurkat cells, treated with an anti-Fas antibody, CH11. beta 2-GPI-bound cells were detected 2 hr later after anti-Fas treatment and the most cells were bound to beta 2-GPI by 6 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of beta 2-GPI-bound cells paralleled with morphological changes and DNA fragmentation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>I also demonstrated that anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies and a beta 2-GPI-dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody, established from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, could recognize beta 2-GPI-bound Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas-antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results imply that beta 2-GPI and anticardiolipin antibody may have a role in the clearance of apoptotic cells from the blood stream </plain></SENT>
