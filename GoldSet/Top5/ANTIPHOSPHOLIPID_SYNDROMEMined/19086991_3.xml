<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: Studies on experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) models proved that molecular mimicry between plasma protein beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) and structure within micro-organisms or their products, might be a cause for experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of polyclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs), it is important to define the precise characteristics of pathogenic aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To avoid the influence of polyclonality and to further analyse the connection between molecular mimicry and APS, we produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid (TTd) and tested their reactivity against beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: In this report, we analysed the characteristics of MAb26 raised against TTd and cross-reactive with beta(2)GPI: its binding properties in various in vitro immunoassays, its specific interactions with surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed on apoptotic cells and its role in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have demonstrated that MAb26: (i) binds beta(2)GPI being immobilized on an appropriate surface: irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates, non-irradiated plates pre-coated with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53250">polyvinylidene fluoride</z:chebi> membrane; (ii) binds specifically to apoptotic but not to viable cells and the binding is beta(2)GPI-dependent; and (iii) induces a pathologic pregnancy outcome when passively injected into BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study concluded that certain subpopulations of antibodies raised against TTd and cross-reactive with beta(2)GPI, because of the molecular mimicry mechanism, could have pathologic potential </plain></SENT>
