<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates that beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin are the main proteins to which autoimmune aPL bind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of different aPL in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 51 outpatients (42 lepromatous and 9 borderline <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>) without any clinical feature of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>35 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and 31 had anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibodies were highly positive in 29/51 and anti- prothrombin antibodies (anti-II) were detected in 23/51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aCL and anti-beta2GPI were of IgM isotype, while IgG isotype was more frequent among anti-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was found when aPL were evaluated in patients grouped according to their bacteriological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients under treatment (n=33) had a similar frequency of positive aPL compared to patients in vigilance (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessing the specificity of antibody binding to CL and beta2GPI in ELISA by means of inhibition studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-beta2GPI liposomes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> and APS sera showed a similar behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparable results were also found in both groups of patients when inhibition experiments with lysate of Mycobacterium leprae were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e>-related aPL resemble those found in patients with APS but the immunoglobulin isotype is different, with IgM much more prevalent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leprosy</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
