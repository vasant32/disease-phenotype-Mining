<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085574" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">palindromic rheumatism</z:e> (PR) in whom signs, symptoms, and/or serologic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical histories of the patients were reviewed with special emphasis on age, gender, duration of PR, and lapse of time until <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were detected or APS was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three representative cases are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients were women and four were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 49.3 years (range 36-80), and the mean duration of PR was 5.5 years (range 3-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, raised titers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were found on two or more occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed clinical pictures compatible with APS, two showed symptoms which may be attributable for APS, and raised titers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were found in only two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems that the appearance of these two uncommon conditions together is more than coincidental and may point to a previously unreported clinical association </plain></SENT>
