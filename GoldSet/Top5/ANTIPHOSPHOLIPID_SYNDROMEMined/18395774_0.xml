<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is a disease with a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These events may recur despite anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such cases, placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered to prevent propagation of a distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> toward the pulmonary vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether the placement of such a filter is beneficial in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Retrospective evaluation of the value of IVC filter placement as prophylaxis against recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> in patients with medically treated APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 10 patients suffering from APS who, despite anticoagulation treatment, had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent placement of an IVC filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined their medical files for further recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 10 patients in our study, only 1 had a documented PE following the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients had no evidence of PE after the filter insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of the 10 patients died, 2 of them suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In those 2 patients, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is unknown, but PE cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IVC filters seem to be protective against recurrent PE in APS patients but the true extent of their efficacy requires further study </plain></SENT>
