<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To ascertain preexisting medical conditions, clinical evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, and associated immunological disorders in a series of young patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty two patients younger than 50 years, who had presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thrombotic episode, were studied prospectively with a general physical, ophthalmoscopic and immunological examination, placing special emphasis on the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No baseline disease stood out significantly over the others, and the most frequent risk factor found was systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (5/22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No associated risk factor was found in nine cases (41%), and more than two factors were found in six cases (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> affected the venous vessels (18/81%), and five of them were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmologic follow-up showed a rapid evolution to <z:mp ids='MP_0008852'>retinal neovascularization</z:mp> in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show many immunologically altered values, there being nine cases (41%) of the series with more than four parameters altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiphospholipid assay showed a high prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (5/23%), and two patients were diagnosed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies and immunologic abnormalities found in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> younger patients leads us to recommend the systematic immunological study in these subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has relevant diagnostic and therapeutic implications in a population with no evident associated risk factors and a greater severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
