<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the study were: (a) to evaluate myocardial perfusion defects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> by contrast echocardiography and nuclear imaging; and (b) to evaluate the prevalence of alterations in subclinical myocardial perfusion defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion in 37 patients was evaluated by contrast echocardiography at rest and with dobutamine and with nuclear imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the two diagnostic tests at rest was 0.72 (P &lt; 0.0001) and with dobutamine was 0.65 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of abnormalities in myocardial perfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> by contrast echocardiography and nuclear imaging was 27% and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We concluded that there is a high level of agreement between contrast ecocardiography and nuclear imaging for assessment of myocardial perfusion defects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and their prevalence is similar to that reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
