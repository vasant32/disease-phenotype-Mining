<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (RF) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> that share similar cardiac and neurological pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the presence of shared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> between M protein, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28009">N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine</z:chebi> (GlcNAc) and beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2GPI), the pathogenic molecules engaged in these autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from the APS patients were affinity-purified on beta2GPI and beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from RF patients were affinity-purified on protein G column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beta2GPI and M protein-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were prepared by conventional solid-phase <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay direct binding and inhibition studies were performed on the RF and APS sera for the presence, and cross-reactivity, of antibodies against beta2GPI, beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, streptococcal M protein, M-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and GlcNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antibodies (Abs) to beta2GPI were found in 24.4% of 90 RF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against various beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were found in 1.1-36.7% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin G sera from RF patients possessed significant anti-beta2GPI activity, while sera from APS patients contained a considerable anti-streptococcal M protein as well as anti-GlcNAc activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, affinity-purified anti-beta2GPI and anti-beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> Abs from APS patients cross-reacted with streptococcal M protein and M5 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, while beta2GPI and beta2GPI-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> inhibited anti-streptococcal M protein activity from RF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results were confirmed by immunoblot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The beta2GPI also inhibited anti-GlcNAc activity from APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study, showing a considerable overlap of humoral immunity in RF and APS, support a hypothesis that common pathogenic mechanisms underlie the development of cardiac valve lesions and Central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>Nervous System abnormalities</z:mp> in both diseases </plain></SENT>
