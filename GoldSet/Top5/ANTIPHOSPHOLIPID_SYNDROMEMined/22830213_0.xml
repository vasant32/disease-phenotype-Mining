<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Pg level was measured in 78 APS patients: 35 of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 43 had primary APS and 19 with idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (IT) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pg and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>-1 levels were estimated kinetically </plain></SENT>
