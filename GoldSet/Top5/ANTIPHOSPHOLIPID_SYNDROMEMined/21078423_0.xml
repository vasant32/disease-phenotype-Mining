<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a common method used to inhibit the abnormal antibody levels and decrease the mortality of APS in emergency situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the Fc fragment of IgG is the molecular structure responsible for these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the beneficial effects of both recombinant and natural human Fc fragments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> IgG against human anti-β2-GP1 antibodies in mouse models with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed that both recombinant and natural human Fc fragments moderately but significantly decreased the levels of serum anti-β2-GP1 antibodies and had anti-coagulation effects in human β2-GP1-immunized mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both recombinant and natural human Fc fragments inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> formation and decreased mortality in mouse models infused intravenously with human anti-β2GP1 antibodies from patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that the Fc fragment might be one of the active structural units of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, recombinant human Fc fragment administration may be a useful treatment for individuals with APS </plain></SENT>
