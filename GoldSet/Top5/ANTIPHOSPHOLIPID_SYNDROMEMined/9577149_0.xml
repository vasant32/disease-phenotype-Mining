<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome is a clinical syndrome of venous and arterial thrombotic events, recurrent pregnancy loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with two autoantibodies: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) and anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A group of 83 pregnant patients with recurrent fetal loss or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008071'>maternal hypertension</z:hpo> for the presence of autoantibodies has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or any other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> such as sclerodermia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo>, autoimmune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients have been divided into two groups: a) 45 women with fetal wastage history; b) 38 women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008071'>maternal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of autoantibodies in the first group reaches 31.1% (14/45 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these 14 patients (14.3%) had fetal loss (one with treatment and one without) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>12 of this 14 patients (85.7%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> delivery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two treatment scheme were used in this study: one with aspirin and another with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the group of 45 patients there were 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> deliveries: 27 (79.5%) pregnancies were treated with aspirin and 7 (20.6%) were treated with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 11 fetal loss and 9 (81.1%) in patients without treatment and 2 (18.2%) in treated pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of autoantibodies in the second group reaches 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusions, it can be suggested that treatment strategies for the prevention of fetal loss in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are warranted because treatment appears to alter fetal outcome favorably </plain></SENT>
