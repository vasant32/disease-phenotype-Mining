<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed separately 73 pregnancies that occurred in 46 women from a cohort of 633 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had at least one pregnancy after SLE diagnosis, one or more of our severity criteria and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had taken immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Included data were related to disease severity, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), anticardiolipin antibodies (a-CL ab), and drugs received during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were pregnancies with fetal wastage; controls were pregnancies with live-born children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at pregnancy was 26.6 +/- 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases had longer disease duration, 6.1 +/- 3.5 years vs 4.5 +/- 4.3 of controls (p = 0.02); higher prevalence of renal involvement, <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05); they also tended to have a greater prevalence of a-CL ab, and previous fetal losses (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases used <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> more frequently than controls (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed an association of renal involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> prescription during pregnancy, previous fetal losses and APS with fetal wastage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive drugs and the APS remained significant in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.05; F = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors related with fetal losses in women with severe SLE were: longer disease duration, ingestion of immunosuppressive drugs during pregnancy and any related manifestation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We did not find macroscopic malformations in live-children of women that took <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
