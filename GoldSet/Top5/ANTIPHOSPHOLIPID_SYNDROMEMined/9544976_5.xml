<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dense, red dyed <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> beads coated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> were incubated with test sera for a short period of time, then added to a microtube containing anti-human IgG in a gel provided within a pre-cast card (DiaMed ID Microtyping System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The card was centrifuged at 150g for 5 min and then examined for movement of the beads through the gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beads without bound antibody travelled through the gel and formed a pellet on the bottom of the tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-human IgG within the gel matrix impeded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-coated beads when <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> bound to the beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positivity was indicated by the formation of a layer of beads on the top of the gel matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective analysis of 103 samples for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> by flow cytometry and the gel-card technique showed good correlation between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples found to be positive by flow cytometry (23 of 103) were identified as positive by the gel-card technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two samples were identified as positive by the gel-card method but negative by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The technique is simple to perform and should prove useful as a rapid screening method for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
