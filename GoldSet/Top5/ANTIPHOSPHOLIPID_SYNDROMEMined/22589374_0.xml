<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the long-term outcome and immunological status of children born to mothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, to determine the factors responsible for childhood abnormalities, and to correlate the child's immunological profile with their mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective follow-up of a European multicentre cohort was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow-up consisted of clinical examination, growth data, neurodevelopmental milestones and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APL) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children were examined at 3, 9, 24 months and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 134 children were analysed (female sex in 65 cases, birth weight 3000±500 g, height 48±3 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen per cent had a preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks; n=22), and 14% weighted less than 2500 g at birth (n=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neonatal complications were noted in 18 cases (13%), with five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 5-year follow-up, no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four children displayed behavioural abnormalities, which consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> behaviour, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">feeding disorder</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000750'>language delay</z:hpo> and axial hypotony with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At birth <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was present in four (4%), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) IgG in 18 (16%), anti-β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-β2GPI) IgG/M in 16 (15%) and three (3%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ACL IgG and anti-β2GPI disappeared at 6 months in nine (17%) and nine (18%), whereas APL persisted in 10% of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ACL and anti-β2GPI IgG were correlated with the same mother's antibodies before 6 months of age (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of APL in children, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or SLE were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities seems to be more important in these children, and could justify long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
