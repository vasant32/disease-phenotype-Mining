<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI and IgG anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum samples from 118 patients with SLE, including 40 with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2GPI were positive in 17% (20/118) of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence and titres of IgG anti-beta2GPI were strongly associated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
