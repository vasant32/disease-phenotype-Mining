<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We wanted to evaluate whether testing for anti-phosholipid antibodies other than anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM identifies patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) who may be positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a cross-sectional study comprising 62 patients with APS, 66 women with RPL, 50 healthy blood donors and 24 women with a history of successful pregnancies, we tested IgM and IgG antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine with and without beta-2 glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) from a single manufacturer as well as aCL and abeta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracies of individual and combined anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (aPL) assays were assessed by computing sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values together with their 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a general trend for increased sensitivities in the presence of beta2GPI co-factor with significant effect for certain specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall combined sensitivity of the non-recommended aPL assays was not significantly higher than that of the aCL and aB2GPI tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple aPL specificities in RPL group is not significantly different from controls and therefore of no clinical significance </plain></SENT>
