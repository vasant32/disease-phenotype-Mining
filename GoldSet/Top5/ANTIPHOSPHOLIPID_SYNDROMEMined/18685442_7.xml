<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of acquired and genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in 198 women with recurrent fetal loss who were having three or more than three abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine women had only early pregnancy losses, that is, first trimester abortions, 30 women had only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses, that is, second and third trimester abortions whereas 89 had both early and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group included 100 age-matched fertile parous women who did not have any obstetric complications and had at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several genetic and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> markers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest association was observed with anticardiolipin (odds ratio 22.6, confidence interval 5.7-89, P = 0) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1, antiannexin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndromes was detected with the time of pregnancy loss in anticardiolipin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, which was significantly associated with early pregnancy loss as compared with second and third trimester loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case of beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1, antiannexin it was less significantly associated with early pregnancy loss as compared with second and third trimester loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of fetal loss with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> was the highest risk observed for any heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, followed by protein C, factor V Leiden, endothelial protein C receptor, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and beta448 fibrinogen polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modest risks were also observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase, plasminogen activator inhibitor 4G/4G polymorphisms and beta448 fibrinogen polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of two or more than two genetic risk factors were observed in 55 (27.7%), whereas the genetic and acquired risk factors were observed in 107 (54%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> is an important contributing factor for both early and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses; approximately two-thirds of our cases of unexplained fetal losses could be explained by acquired or heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or both, which is in line with other western studies </plain></SENT>
