<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal blood samples were collected from 8 weeks of gestation in 28 women with treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 19 control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 were measured by immunoradiometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> pregnancies miscarried, four pregnancies had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, six pregnancies had a thrombotic event, and one pregnancy had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>abruptio placentae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/-SD) birth weight in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> group was 2867 +/- 914 g (control, 3492 +/- 527 g; P =.02), and the mean gestation at delivery was 36.5 +/- 5.2 weeks (control, 40.3 +/- 0.7 weeks; P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 and insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations increased with gestational age in both groups (2.8% and 2.4% per week), but insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was 61% higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> group (95% CI, 16%-122%; P =.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-I was not significantly different (8% higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>; 95% CI, -10% to 30%; P =.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 are abnormal in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> group and may reflect abnormalities in trophoblast invasion </plain></SENT>
