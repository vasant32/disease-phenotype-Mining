<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a flow-cytometric assay (FCA) based on the hypothesis that anti-platelet-anionic-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> autoantibodies (aPL) interfere with the activity of the natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein annexin A5, thereby accelerating platelet procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the clinical utility of the feasible FCA, which demonstrates the competition of the patient's aPL with the binding of annexin A5 to the platelet-anionic-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, in the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two (94%) of 66 APS patients, 20 (51%) of 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and two (4%) of 49 healthy individuals were positive by FCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the anticardiolipin (aCL) assay, the relative sensitivity was 82% and the specificity 73.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 19 (25%) aCL-negative patients were positive by FCA; 12 were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with LA assay, the relative sensitivity was 85% and the specificity 72.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 21 (26%) LA-negative patients were FCA-positive, 12 were positive for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FCA was particularly sensitive for APS patients with arterial (97.0%) and gestational vascular complications (100%) with overall sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the FCA is practical, sensitive and specific for the detection of clinically relevant aPL in the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
