<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antibodies and anti-fibrin-bound t-PA antibodies as possible causes of hypofibrinolysis in 39 patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the differences in anti t-PA antibodies between patients without previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20 patients) and patients with previous episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (19 patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> in nine, ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in six, arterial leg <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one, hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in one, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> in one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-t-PA antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and anti-t-PA fibrin-bound antibodies were measured by a solid-phase fibrin immunoassay (SOFIA) in 39 patients with PAPS and in 39 controls matched for gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High levels of IgG anti-t-PA were found in three out of 39 patients with PAPS, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; four other patients, one of whom had a history of thrombotic events, had high titres of antibodies directed against fibrin-bound t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had significantly higher levels of IgG anti-t-PA than patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data showed that, in patients with PAPS, the highest levels of anti-t-PA antibodies were present in subjects with previous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in the results obtained with two methods of detection of anti-t-PA antibodies, ELISA and SOFIA, indicates a different interaction of the antibodies with the t-PA molecules, which are directly bound to <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates in ELISA and bound to fibrin as a bridging molecule in SOFIA </plain></SENT>
