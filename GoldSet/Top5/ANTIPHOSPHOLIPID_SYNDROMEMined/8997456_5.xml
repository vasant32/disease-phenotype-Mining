<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The precise target of marker autoantibodies in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the theory that surface-bound beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2 GPI) presents a normally encrypted autoepitope and that antibodies to beta 2 GPI (anti-beta 2 GPI) are associated with APS, has been prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The literature has been searched from 1990 to 1995 (inclusive) to find studies in which: (1) anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies were measured and, (2) adequate clinical data describing the patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These conditions were met in four studies, from August 1992 to December 1995, in which patient samples ranged from 15 to 39 cases, the total of the four studies being 90 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Applying the diagnostic criteria of &gt; or = 2 clinical manifestations of APS, 65 cases had APS while 25 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the group with APS, 58/65 (89 percent) were anti-beta 2 GPI (+); among those who did not meet the criteria, 11/25 (44 percent) were anti-beta 2 GPI (+) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of either the primary (1 degree) or secondary (2 degrees) form of APS made no difference in association with anti-beta 2 GPI; 13/16 (81 percent) patients with 1 degree APS and 45/49 (92 percent) with 2 degrees APS had anti-beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) did not predict APS: 25/58 (38 percent) APS (+) cases were LAC (+); 11 APS (-) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LC (+) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG anticardiolipin also showed a closer association with APS absence (25/25 cases; 100 percent) than with APS presence (40/65; 62 percent, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data support the contention that anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies are closely associated with APS and that their measurement may facilitate the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
