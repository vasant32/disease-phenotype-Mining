<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters investigated were analyzed by ELISA using commercial reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PAPS patients with MI, in comparison to the group of non-PAPS MI survivors, had significantly elevated concentrations of oxLDL (p = 0.003) and anti-oxLDL antibodies (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-anxA5 antibodies of the IgG isotype were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> (OR = 4.788, p = 0.036, 95% CI: 1.104 - 20.762) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies represent additional risk factors which, together with other factors, might lead to complications of arterial thromboses, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> in PAPS, while association of IgG anti-anxA5 antibodies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> is a reflection of the small number of patients with this feature involved in the study and should therefore be investigated further </plain></SENT>
