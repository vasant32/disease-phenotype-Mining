<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL were found in 25 (34%) patients; IgG in 23 (12 had low titres, six moderate titres and five high titres) and IgM in five (three and two had respectively moderate and high titres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight (11%) patients were found to have LA; anti-beta2GP1 antibodies were detected only in three (4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two patients with LA, aPL and beta2GP1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with moderate titres of aPL exhibited recurrent spontaneous foetal losses </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other systemic involvements of pSS were the same in both groups with or without aPL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even if aPL prevalence reached 30% in pSS, titres were usually low, with a close correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> but not with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, which is related to positivity of both LA and aPL </plain></SENT>
