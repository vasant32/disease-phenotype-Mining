<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a missense mutation in the factor V gene (1691 G--&gt;A) has been identified that results in an abnormal factor V product (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutation, known as the Leiden mutation, causes an amino acid substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 506 in the factor V molecule and renders the protein resistant to proteolytic inactivation by activated protein C and thus predisposes to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (2, 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that some individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> may also carry the Leiden mutation, and thus have a "second hit" predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, allele-specific hybridization and allele-specific restriction analysis were used to test for the Leiden mutation in thirty women with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 10 of whom had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the women were heterozygous or homozygous for the factor V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> is not a prerequisite for the thrombotic events in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, due to the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> seen in patients lacking the factor V mutation </plain></SENT>
