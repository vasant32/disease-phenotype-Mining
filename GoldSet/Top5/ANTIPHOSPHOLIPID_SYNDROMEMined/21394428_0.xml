<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if elevated levels of ferritin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients correlate with disease activity and organ involvement in a large cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels (gender and age adjusted) were assessed in 274 lupus serum samples utilizing the LIASON Ferritin automated immunoassay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant disease activity was determined if European Consensus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Activity Index (ECLAM)&gt;2 or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)&gt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilizing an EXCEL database, we compared elevated ferritin levels to manifestations grouped by organ involvement, serology, and previous therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were predominantly female (89%), median age was 37 years old, and disease duration was 10.6 ± 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperferritinemia was found in 18.6% of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ferritin levels, a significantly greater proportion of patients with hyperferritinemia had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (15.4% vs. 33.3%, p=0.003) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (11.3% vs. 29.0%, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, compared to normoferritinemic subjects, hyperferritinemic subjects had significantly higher total aCL (99.7 ± 369 vs. 30.9 ± 17.3 GPI, p=0.02) and aCL IgM antibody levels (75.3 ± 357.4 vs. 9.3 ± 10.3 GPI, p=0.02), and marginally lower aCL IgG antibody levels (9.2 ± 4.9 vs. 9.7 ± 3.9 GPI, p = 0.096) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While the ECLAM score significantly correlated with hyperferritinemia (p=0.04), the SLEDAI score was marginally associated with hyperferritinemia (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serositis was marginally associated with hyperferritinemia, but not with other manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An association with serologic APS was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hyperferritinemia was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies suggest that it may be an early marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
