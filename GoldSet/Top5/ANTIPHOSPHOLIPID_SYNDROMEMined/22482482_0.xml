<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is characterised by arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> combined with the presence of specific antibodies known as antiphospholipids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is commonly associated with cutaneous signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we report a case of atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cutaneous eruption</z:e> occurring during the course of APS and we discuss the possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 45-year-old woman consulted twice within six months for an erythematosus papular eruption around the neckline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was being followed-up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> treated with fluindione (Préviscan®), and her International Normalized Ratio (INR) was consistent with the prescribed anticoagulation target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood tests confirmed the presence of anticardiolipin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, but no laboratory evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy demonstrated the presence within the vascular lumen of a weakly eosinophilic anhistic substance positive for <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> stain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was given <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> (Kardégic®) combined with fluindione, and four years later, she had presented no relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Despite a clinically evocative appearance, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> tumidus was ruled out in our patient by histopathological features, and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was repeatedly refuted on the basis of clinical and laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the specific histological images of intraluminal deposits within the dermal vessels seen in this patient, although not typical of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, are associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical remission seen from the start of antiplatelet treatment could be due to the action of these drugs against the obstruction of small-calibre dermal vessels </plain></SENT>
