<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The in vivo physiologic role of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) is presumed to be related to its interactions with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased quantities of procoagulant microparticles derived by the vesiculation of blood cells have been detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) frequently associated with antibodies against beta2GPI (anti-beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of beta2GPI and anti-beta2GPI on giant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles (GPVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GPVs composed of phosphatidylserine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> were formed in an aqueous medium and individually transferred to a compartment containing either beta2GPI, anti-beta2GPI, or beta2GPI along with anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shape changes of a single GPV were observed by a phase contrast microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most GPVs transferred to the solution containing only beta2GPI budded moderately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon the transfer of GPVs to the solution containing beta2GPI and anti-beta2GPI either from patient with APS or mouse monoclonal anti-beta2GPI Cof-22, the budding was much more pronounced, generating also daughter vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No such effects were seen when GPV was transferred to the solution containing anti-beta2GPI without beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a significant physiologic role of beta2GPI in the budding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes, which may be explained by the insertion of the C-terminal loop of beta2GPI into membranes, thus increasing the surface of the outer layer of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI, recognizing domains I to IV of beta2GPI, enhanced the budding and vesiculation of GPVs in the presence of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This might be a novel pathogenic mechanism of anti-beta2GPI, promoting in vivo the expression of proadhesive and procoagulant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces in APS </plain></SENT>
