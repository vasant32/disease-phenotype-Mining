<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patient is presented who developed white-matter lesions in the brain and spinal-cord, shortly after receiving toxic doses of radiation for an arterio-venous malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The institution of interferon therapy for presumptive MS not only led to worsening neurologic deficits, but triggered a cutaneous syndrome with pleomorphic stigmata of microvascular injury (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, splinter haemorrhages) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that radiation injury and treatment with interferon-therapy constituted iatrogenic 'hits' of endothelial injury, and potentiated aPL-mediated microangiopathic disease affecting the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and the skin </plain></SENT>
