<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Uncertainty exists, however, as to whether other reported features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> such as cardiac valvular vegetations are truly part of this disorder or more reflective of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have concluded that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have a higher risk of developing Libman-Sacks <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are the only risk factors for cardiac valvular disease in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) or SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with PAPS were matched with 20 patients with SLE and 20 healthy control subjects by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were tested for anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies by means of a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent two-dimensional and color-flow Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The echocardiograms were interpreted by two cardiologists blinded to the patients' underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the PAPS group had cardiac valvular involvement compared with 40% of the SLE group (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cardiac valvular vegetations are common both in aCL-negative patients with SLE and in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that aCL antibodies either play no causative role or are not the only risk factors in the development of cardiac valvular vegetations </plain></SENT>
