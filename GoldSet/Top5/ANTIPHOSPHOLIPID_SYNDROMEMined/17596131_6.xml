<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The classification criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were updated in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze associations between clinical complications and laboratory test abnormalities typical for APS in a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, based on the recently updated criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-six patients were enrolled into the study, with the majority (n = 235) suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory determinations included: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta(2)GPI) antibodies (ABs) [of both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM class] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association was found between laboratory and clinical features of APS; odds ratios (ORs) for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with the presence of LA, aCL, and anti-beta(2)GPI Abs were 4.04 [95% CI: 2.44-6.68], 3.71 (95% CI 2.32-5.92) and 2.57 (95% CI 1.60-4.1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis showed marked differences between the risk of clinical complications associated with the presence of an antibody in the IgG class (OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.42-7.12, and OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.37-9.61 for aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI, respectively) and in the IgM class (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.31-3.70, and OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.15-3.14 for aCL and anti-beta(2)GPI, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postulated inclusion of anti-beta(2)GPI antibody positivity into the previous laboratory criteria changed only slightly the number of patients diagnosed with APS (from 112 to 117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The updated APS classification criteria clearly represent a step forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, our results argue against the use of overall positivity for aCL or anti-beta(2)GPI, and favor a clear distinction between the IgG and IgM classes of antiphospholipid ABs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with both LA and anti-beta(2)GPI IgG or LA and aCL IgG positivity may represent the subgroups at the highest risk of thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
