<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate very premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, we studied prospectively 52 consecutive patients (34 women and 18 men) aged 16-35 years (mean 28.6 +/- 5.6 years) admitted over a 6-year period for an arterial cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> identified on CT, on MRI or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were investigated using a standard protocol including cerebral angiography, transthoracic echocardiography, 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, coagulation inhibitors levels, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> testing, HIV and syphilitic serologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional investigations were performed in a majority of patients: transesophageal echocardiography in 33, contrast echocardiography in 50, and anticardiolipin antibodies levels in 38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The arterial distribution of infarction did not differ from that of overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases were classified as certain aetiologies, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> with high embolic risk (n = 9), spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (n = 1), and inherited antithrombine III deficiency (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen cases were classified as possible aetiologies including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> with low embolic risk (n = 11) such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, miscellaneaous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathies</z:e> (n = 3) such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002191'>arterial dysplasia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> syndrome (n = 1) and migrainous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 18 last cases were classified as unknown aetiologies, despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but one had at least one vascular risk factor: this group significantly differed from the formers in that the patients were more frequently women using oral contraceptive associated with tobacco consumption, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died acutely and the survivors were followed 31 +/- 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed using the Rankin scale on admission and 6 to 12 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: patients evaluated &lt; or = 2 (no to mild handicap) were 31% on admission and 82% after recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty six p. cent remained unable to resume a work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite extensive evaluation, identification and classification of aetiologies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in young adults should be cautious because the risk as well as the pathogenesis of many potential causes still need to be defined </plain></SENT>
