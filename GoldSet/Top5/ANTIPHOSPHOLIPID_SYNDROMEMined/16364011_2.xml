<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with aPL have a high risk of foetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, with low-dose aspirin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) in combination with subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the chances of full-term delivery increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> treatment is avoided in pregnant, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>-sensitive women with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rapid oral challenge-desensitization to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was performed in four pregnant women with a history of APS and aspirin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three patients, desensitization was performed during pregnancy and before the next pregnancy in the fourth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Desensitization was carried out in the ICU using increasing doses of aspirin (0.1-125 mg) over a 24-hr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> desensitization was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe side effects occurred during the desensitization test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one patient required a small oral dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="37956">antihistamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin desensitization may be a safe alternative even during pregnancy if carefully monitored and permit patients with APS to receive treatment with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This would constitute a new indication in pregnant women with APS and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> sensitivity </plain></SENT>
