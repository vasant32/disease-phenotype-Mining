<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>(APS) include arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and a fetal loss, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism of thrombogenic state in APS, we investigated the markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> including thrombin-antithrombin complex(TAT) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>(aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2(F1 + 2) in patients with APS and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> patients with aPL increased significantly compared with those obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> patients without aPL or in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was not a significant difference in the TAT level of each group, suggesting that the formation of TAT was impeded in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate which aPL is responsible for the disturbance of the TAT formation, the ratio of F1 + 2/TAT was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, especially with prolonged kaolin clotting time, and furthermore the ratio strongly increased in patients with IgG type-anticardiolipin antibodies(aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that IgG-aCL is associated with thrombogenic state in APS because free thrombin is present in patients' blood by impeding the formation of TAT by mainly IgG-aCL </plain></SENT>
