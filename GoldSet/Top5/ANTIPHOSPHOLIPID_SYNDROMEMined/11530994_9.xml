<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relation to clinical manifestations, primarily thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, was recognised in the 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this clinical study two cohorts of patients, a population-based (84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)) and a hospital-based (87 patients with SLE and 53 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e>) were investigated for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and associated clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) of IgG and IgM classes were found in 13 and 38% of the population-based patients and in 29 and 58% of the hospital-based patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding figures for antibodies against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) were 15 and 10% in the population-based patients and 14 and 8% in the hospital-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibodies were always found in association with the corresponding immunoglobulin class of ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cohorts anti-beta2GPI of the IgG class were associated with arterial/venous occlusion, a result concordant with other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A novel finding in both cohorts, however, was an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and IgM anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
