<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: TNFa was measured with ELISA (Immunogenetics N.V., Belgium) in the sera from 147 SLE patients (70 men and 77 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those of 20 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TNFa elevated concentrations were found in 49% examinees with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentration of TNFa, SLE activity and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that TNFa is involved in pathogenesis of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of TNFa may serve a useful tool for monitoring SLE activity </plain></SENT>
