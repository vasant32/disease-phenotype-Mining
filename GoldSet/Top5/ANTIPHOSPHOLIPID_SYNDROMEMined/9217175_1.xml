<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies cause prolongation of in vitro clotting tests by inhibition of the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent to which this inhibition reflects antibody binding to, or functional inhibition of, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> alone, prothrombin alone, or a prothrombin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complex is pertinent to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin fractions (IgG) from 18 patients with LA activity were tested for inhibitory activity against prothrombin activation by either factor Xa, in a purified prothrombinase system, or by purified fractions of snake venoms (E. carinatus, E. multisquamatus) which cleave prothrombin at the same initial site as the prothrombinase complex but do not require anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> as a cofactor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parallel testing of the same IgG samples for prothrombin binding by immunoassay was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IgG samples inhibited the prothrombinase reaction, only three exhibited any inhibition of venom protease prothrombin activation in either the presence or absence of PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one sample exhibited prothrombin binding by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> antibodies are heterogenous and that many, if not most, of the autoantibody populations responsible for LA activity impair prothrombin activation by interaction either with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> alone or with a restricted range of prothrombin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed by prothrombin only as part of the intact prothrombin-prothrombinase complex </plain></SENT>
