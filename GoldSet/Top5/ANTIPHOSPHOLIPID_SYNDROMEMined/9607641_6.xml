<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in these patients may cause acquired activated protein C resistance, whereas hereditary activated protein C resistance results from a common single point mutation in coagulation factor V (factor VLeiden) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a family of 11 members with 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was documented in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three out of these were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> associated with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, these 3 subjects were also heterozygous for the factor VLeiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in this group of individuals did life threatening thromboembolic complications occur, while other thrombocytopenic family members showed no thrombotic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies revealed no linkage between APS and HLA class II alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we present a family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, which is associated with primary APS in at least 50% of thrombocytopenic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of both APS and factor VLeiden in thrombocytopenic subjects, led to an increased number of thrombotic events, suggesting a critical role of combined acquired and hereditary activated protein C resistance in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since no association between APS and specific HLA groups was found, other underlying risk factors for the development of APS must be considered </plain></SENT>
