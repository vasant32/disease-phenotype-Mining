<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) display a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of antibodies with beta(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 (β(2)GP1) as the major antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We isolated and characterized human mAbs directed against β(2)GP1 from the immune repertoire of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Variable heavy chain repertoires from B cells from two APS patients with anti-β(2)GP1 antibodies were cloned into the pHEN1-VLrep vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constructed full-length IgG antibodies were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) activity and binding to β(2)GP1 and its domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two clones of each patient were selected on the basis of the reactivity of single chain Fv (scFv) fragments displayed on phages towards full-length β(2)GP1 and its isolated domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affinity of selected antibodies for β(2)GP1 was lost when transforming from phages to monovalent scFvs, and was regained when antibodies were constructed as complete IgG, indicating a role for bivalency in binding to β(2)GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both selected clones from patient 2 recognized domain I of β(2)GP1, and for both clones selected from patient 1, binding required the presence of both domain I and domain II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mAbs displayed LAC activity in both activated partial thromboplastin time-based and dilute Russell's viper venom test-based clotting assays and in thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show successful cloning of patient-derived mAbs that require domain I of β(2)GP1 for binding, and that display LAC activity that is dependent on their affinity for β(2)GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These antibodies can help us to gain more insights into the pathogenesis of APS, and may facilitate standardization of APS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
