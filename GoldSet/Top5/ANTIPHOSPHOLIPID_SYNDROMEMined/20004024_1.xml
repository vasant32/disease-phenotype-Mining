<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a case-controlled cohort study, peripheral blood was obtained at 8-14 weeks of gestation from a consecutive series of 1155 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case group comprised 36 patients who later developed PIH during the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 PIH patients, 13 had severe PIH, 18 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and 11 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eleven age- and parity-matched women whose pregnancies ended in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> delivery without obstetric complications were selected as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that a titer of anti-beta2GPI IgG&gt;or=1.0 U/ml was a risk factor for severe PIH (P=0.023, OR 5.7 95%CI 1.4-22.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, titers of anti-beta2GPI IgM&gt;or=1.2 U/ml was found to be a risk factor for PIH (P=0.001, OR 8.8 95%CI 1.6-47.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women positive for anti-beta2GPI but negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine-dependent anti-prothrombin, or kininogen-dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> antibodies, the presence of anti-beta2GPI was not a significant risk factor for development of PIH or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of anti-beta2GPI antibody represents a risk factor for developing PIH and severe PIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the utility of anti-beta2GPI determination as one of the laboratory criteria for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of anti-beta2GPI measurement among women without other anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies requires further study </plain></SENT>
