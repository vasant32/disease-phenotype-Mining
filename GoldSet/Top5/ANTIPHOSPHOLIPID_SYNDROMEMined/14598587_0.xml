<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to B2GP-I and CL of IgG isotype were measured at enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of IgG aCL and IgG aB2GP-I in the serum of PAPS patients were 69.9 +/- 116.0 GPL, 74.1 +/- 117.4 SGU, respectively; of SAPS and SLE patients 60.5 +/- 68.9 GPL and 66.2 +/- 88.3 SGU, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These values were significantly higher than in SLE patients (19.5 +/- 27.6 GPL, p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0012; 14.5 +/- 41.9 SGU, p = 0.0001, respectively) and donors (3.9 +/- 3.8 GPL, p = 0.0001; 5.7 +/- 1.2 SGU, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By IgG aCL and IgG-aB2GP-I, PAPS and SAPS patients differed insignificantly (p &gt; 0.05), but these values correlated positively (r = 0.85; p &lt; 0.0005 for PAPS and r = 0.9, p &lt; 0.005 for SAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous detection of IgG aCL and IgG aB2GP-I occurred in 36.8% in PAPS, 52.4% in SAPS and 12.3% in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10.5% PAPS patients were positive by IgG aCL as well as 9.5% with SAPS and 13.4% with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated rise of IgG aB2GP-I concentration was observed in 21.1% patients with PAPS, in 9.5% patients with SAPS and 9.6% patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 43 patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 46.5% were positive by IgG aCL and IgG aB2GP-I, 7.0% positive only by IgG aCL and 11.6% only by IgG aB2GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgG aCL and IgG aB2GP-I in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (64.7 +/- 87.5 GPL and 66.0 +/- 94.8 SGU, respectively) were significantly higher than in patients without them (19.6 +/- 3.8 GPL, p = 0.009 and 16.4 +/- 52.2 SGU, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> IgG aCL and IgG aB2GP-I were higher than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For diagnosis of APS sensitivity and specificity of IgG aB2GP-I and IgG aCL were 60.0 and 83.8%; 57.1 and 73.5% (p &gt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the sensitivity and specificity were 58.1 and 84.6%; 54.5 and 72.7% (p &gt; 0.005), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, IgG aB2GP-I is an essential additional marker of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the presence of APS symptoms, but in negative results of APS test it is justified to confirm APS diagnosis by aB2GP-I test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To make APS diagnosis more accurate, it is valid to make simultaneous measurements of aCL using standard B2GP-I dependent enzyme immunoassay and aB2GP-I </plain></SENT>
