<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if the prevalence of 2 prothrombotic genetic factors, factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation, is increased in patients with antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies with a history of venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> compared to patients with aPL antibodies with no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with aPL antibodies were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of venous and arterial thrombotic events since the time of antibody detection was determined retrospectively, using appropriate clinical and diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were documented and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, cigarette smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, positive family history, use of oral contraceptive, pregnancy, trauma, hospitalization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from blood cells for determination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> G1691 --&gt; A and prothrombin mutation G20210 --&gt; A by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 157 patients, 69 had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (venous 37, arterial 32); 147 (94%) patients had anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies; 69 (45%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of factor V Leiden in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 13% compared to 4.6% in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR 3.11, CI 0.92-10.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with aCL antibodies, 15% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> had factor V mutation compared to 3.5% of patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR 4.9, CI 1.2-19.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin gene mutation was identified in 5 patients, none of whom had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that LAC (p = 0.005), male sex (p = 0.04), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) were the strongest risk factors for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and that no additional risk was conferred by factor V Leiden (p = 0.13) and prothrombin gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of factor V Leiden is modestly increased in patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, these results suggest that its detection does not significantly increase the risk of a thrombotic event, once other clinical risk factors have been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin gene mutation is not associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
