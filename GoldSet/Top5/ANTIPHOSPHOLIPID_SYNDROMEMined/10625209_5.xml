<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy has been widely recognized as a predisposing risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it still remains unclear why pregnant women without a history of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) have a higher incidence of DVT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) during pregnancy and puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the activated protein C (APC) system in healthy pregnant women and in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of DVT during puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty unselected Japanese pregnant women without a past or family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or APS and 3 Japanese women with DVT during puerperium were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endogenous thrombin potential-ratio (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>-r) was measured by determination of thrombin-alpha2-macroglobulin complexes in thromboplastin-activated patient plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC sensitivity ratio (APC-sr) was calculated by the determination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>-r in patient plasma in the presence and absence of APC (final concentration [conc.] 5.9 nM) to evaluate the functional APC <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean APC-sr was significantly increased at 30 weeks' gestation (2.35 +/- 0.72) and remained high during puerperium compared with the mean APC-sr in nonpregnant women (1.15 +/- 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean APC-sr in patients with DVT at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was significantly higher (3.57 +/- 0.54) than mean APC-sr during puerperium was, indicating that the sensitivity to APC was reduced in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>-based assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a significant reduction in the functional sensitivity to APC associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
