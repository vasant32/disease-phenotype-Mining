<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High titers of aCL immunoreactivity, mainly the immunoglobulin (Ig) G isotype, were shown to predict aCL-related thrombo-occlusive complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aCL antibodies, and IgG and IgM isotypes were measured by a validated assay in a single laboratory, run in duplicate, in 749 individuals with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (n = 300) and patients with other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease or undergoing diagnostic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age varied according to aCL categories, with a mean of 61.8 years among patients with negative aCL (&lt; 10 IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units [GPL]) to 62.3, 64.9, and 69.9 years in patients with immunoreactivity 10 to 20, 20 to 40, and &gt;40 GPL respectively (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> was associated with significantly higher rates of positive IgG aCL (&gt;10 GPL) and with higher immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL immunoreactivity increased significantly, in a dose-response manner, as a function of the number of cerebrovascular risk factors present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, rates of 10 to 20, 20 to 40, and &gt;40 GPL were 14%, 7%, and 0% among those with no risk factors versus 20%, 12%, and 12% respectively among patients with four or more risk factors (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were identified, however, between IgM isotype aCL and any of the risk factors or increasing number of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The presence of multiple cerebrovascular risk factors is associated with substantially higher rates of positive IgG isotype aCL, and with higher immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings should caution against overdiagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and consequent changes in management among patients with multiple cerebrovascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
