<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE (under reducing conditions) of beta2GPI from three sources indicates that the 54-kDa beta2GPI band is accompanied by a band corresponding to an 8-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of detergent and reducing agents (native PAGE), beta2GPI demonstrated a large complex (molecular mass approximately 320 kDa) which is dissociable by boiling in 6-8 M <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi>, yielding several lower molecular mass bands, one of which corresponds to the 8-kDa protein observed in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from five healthy adults demonstrated native beta2GPI migration equivalent to the commercially purified protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of native beta2GPI show aggregrates of particles each having a diameter of 30-35 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with a globular unit the size of which would be substantially larger than that expected for a 54-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments suggest that the 54-kDa beta2GPI monomer subunits exist as a multimeric complex with the 8-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
