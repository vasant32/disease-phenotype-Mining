<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass distribution of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta(2)-GP1) antibodies (abeta(2)-GP1), and to examine possible associations between the different abeta(2)-GP1 and aCL subclasses and the main clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 130 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and 35 patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure IgG aCL and abeta(2)-GP1 and to determine the IgG subclass distribution of these two autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When the number of patients positive for each subclass was examined, IgG(3) and IgG(2) aCL were more frequent (63.5 and 54.1% of patients were positive for the two subclasses, respectively), while for abeta(2)-GP1 IgG(2) was the most prevalent subclass (81.8% of patients were positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG(2) aCL was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P=0.023) and fetal loss (P=0.013), and IgG(3) aCL was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P=0.0003) and fetal loss (P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG(2) abeta(2)-GP1 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P=0.012) and IgG(3) abeta(2)-GP1 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P=0.036) and fetal loss (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IgG(2) predominance of abeta(2)-GP1 suggests that the antibody response against beta(2)-GP1 may be T-cell-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As IgG(2) and IgG(3) differ in their effector functions, their association with the same clinical manifestations (i.e. <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss) suggests that more than one mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss in APS </plain></SENT>
