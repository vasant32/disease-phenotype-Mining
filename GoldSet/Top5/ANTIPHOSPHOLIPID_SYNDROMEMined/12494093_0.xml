<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess prevalence of cardiac valvular lesions in patients with primary (P) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with and without secondary APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with PAPLS (n=56, 15 men and 41 women), SLE and APLS (n=88, 23 men, 65 women) and SLE without APLS (n=51, 19 men, 32 women) were followed up for 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serological markers of APLS were anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of various heart defects was the highest in PAPLS (43%) compared with SLE with APLS (c2=5.6, p=0.001) and SLE without APLS (c2=9.3, p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In secondary APLS prevalence of valvular involvement was 27% what was substantially more than in SLE without APLS (4%) (c2=7.2, p=0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes of mitral valve cusps and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> were found in 33, 41 and 50% of patients with SLE, SLE with APLS and PAPLS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_94'>valve defects</z:mpath> were significantly more frequent in patients with any APLS compared with those with SLE without APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thickening of aortic cusps was significantly more frequent in patients with PAPLS compared with patients with SLE (with and without APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes of tricuspid valve were significantly more frequent in patients with any APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression of valvular pathology was observed in 2 patients with SLE and APLS after 4 and 5 years of follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During 9 years thrombotic complications developed in 8 patients with APLS and valvular lesions (6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 retinal thromboses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An association exists between presence of APLS and various cardiac valvular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lesions of aortic valve are associated with PAPLS: Development of valvular pathology in patients with SLE and PAPLS during follow up dictates the necessity to monitor echocardiographical parameters and titers of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
