<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cofactor requirements may be assessed by measuring antibodies to beta2GPI or by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween 20</z:chebi> to some reagents in the assays for aPL (anticardiolipin and antiphosphatidyIserine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have measured anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS), and anti beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antibodies (abeta2GPI) in the serum of 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 20 patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (SAD) diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53424">Tween 20</z:chebi> to aPS, the assay couldn't differentiate protein cofactor dependent from independent antibodies, but this can be done by measuring abeta2GPI (P= 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between aCL and a(beta)2GPI in the control group and in the patients with SAD, but not in the HIV-positive (HIV+) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding the HIV+ patients, the best Spearman correlation was obtained between a(beta)2GPI and aCL (0.64, P&lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 out of 7 patients with positive a(beta)2GPI and in 5 out of 6 patients with moderate or high positive aCL of the group of SAD, there was a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of moderate or high values of aCL either alone or together with a(beta)2GPI was significantly associated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moderate or high aCL concentrations and their association with a(beta)2GPI seems to be useful for the assessment of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in unselected patients with SLE or APS </plain></SENT>
