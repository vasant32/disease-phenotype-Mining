<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A debate on updating the laboratory criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) was recently opened in view to lower the risk of over diagnosis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on data related to thrombotic APS, it proposes the exclusion of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (a-beta2-GPI) IgM detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine this possibility in a study which focuses on obstetrical APS (OAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report new data on a prospective multicenter European cohort of 109 pregnant women having APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 73 had purely obstetrical APS, not associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolated antibodies and isolated aCL positivity were present in 50/109 (46%) and in 34/109 (31%) of the women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An isolated a-beta2-GPI IgM was present in three women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aCL and a-beta2-GPI IgM cannot be dropped for the diagnosis and classification of OAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low level of some antibodies associated with severe obstetrical complications raise the issue of keeping or not the same laboratory criteria for OAPS and for thrombotic APS and whether additional criteria after large prospective studies could further improve diagnosis </plain></SENT>
