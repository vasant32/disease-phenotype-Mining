<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to describe our experience with patients who have a transmural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) in the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical profile, demographic characteristics and outcomes of these patients are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2006 and August 2011, 21 patients who presented with a Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were found to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate of this entity was 1.5% (21 out of 1,400 Q wave MI patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were characterized by their young age (the mean age=44.95±14.86), male dominance (90.47%), and a high prevalence of smoking (85.71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, 4 patients have an evident spontaneous spasm shown on coronary angiography which disappeared after intracoronary injection of nitrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Coagulation Disorders</z:e>, such as activated protein C resistance (APC) resistance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome were found in 4 of 12 patients who underwent systematic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> which may be associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> and may explain the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricle ejection was 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5±12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 24±10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients developed residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> which was generally easily controlled by anti-spastic therapy and no patient had a major cardiovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Q-wave MI</z:e> and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries seem to have a good short and long-term prognosis especially when they are treated with an exclusive medical strategy </plain></SENT>
