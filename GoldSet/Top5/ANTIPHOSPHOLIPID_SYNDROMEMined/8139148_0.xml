<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a study to investigate the clinical and renal pathological findings in five patients with APS, but not SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the clinical findings, the patients had negative tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo>, and their renal function and tubular function were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the light microscopic findings, three patients exhibited mild <z:mp ids='MP_0011427'>mesangial hypercellularity</z:mp>, and two had minor glomerular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In immunofluorescent study, there were IgM and/or C3 depositions in the mesangial area in some cases, and in electron microscopic study, there were no special findings other than <z:mp ids='MP_0011427'>mesangial hypercellularity</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> is a rare complication in patients with APS, unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
