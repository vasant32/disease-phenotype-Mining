<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing interest is being paid to the possible consequences of maternal disease and associated treatment on the fetus and newborn infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If maternal disease is characterized by the presence of IgG isotype auto-antibodies, these can cross the placenta with possible antibody-mediated damage to the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of gestational complications, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> is higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> rather than in the general population and probably this finding is related to both maternal disorder and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, results of our studies suggest that the antenatal exposure to immunosuppressive drugs given to mothers during pregnancy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> does not impair significantly the development of immunity in exposed children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, mothers disease and/or treatment could be related to neuropsychological dysfunctions reported in some of their children </plain></SENT>
