<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of circulating anti-protein S (anti-PS) antibodies in association with PS deficiency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma was obtained from blood samples collected from 27 patients with SLE (5 men, 22 women; mean +/- SD age 32 +/- 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-PS antibodies were detected by immunoblotting according to a previously described method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of free and total PS antigen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PS activity was assayed by a clotting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of C4b binding protein (C4bBP) were measured by latex immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 27 patients with SLE, 19 (70.4%) had PS activity, and 12 (44.4%) had PS free antigen below the lower limit established for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population (mean -2SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between PS activity and levels of PS free antigen (r = 0.851, P &lt; 0.001), PS total antigen (r = 0.743, P &lt; 0.001), and C4bBP (r = 0.597, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Circulating anti-PS antibodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) (IgG type) were detected in 7 (25.9%) and 14 (51.9%) of the 27 patients with SLE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient (3.7%) had both anti-PS antibodies and aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PS activities in patients who were positive for anti-PS antibodies (mean 38.7%) tended to be lower than those in patients who were negative for anti-PS antibodies (mean 54.9%), but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-PS antibodies, independently of aPL, may play a role in the occurrence of PS deficiency in some patients with SLE, with possible effects on the function of PS that do not change the levels of PS antigens </plain></SENT>
