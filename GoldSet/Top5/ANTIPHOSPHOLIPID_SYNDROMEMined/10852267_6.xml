<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of serum anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) antibodies and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study their diagnostic value for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-beta2-GPI and IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) were determined in sera from 102 consecutive patients with SLE using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum and plasma tests were also done for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, and antibodies to dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory features of APS were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalences were 23.5% for aCL and 18.6% for anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the presence of aCL and anti-beta2-GPI and between their titers were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between anti-beta2-GPI and disease activity criteria (SLEDAI, ECLAM, dsDNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI were significantly associated with LAC (p = 0.005), APS (p = 0.005), and a high aCL titer (aCL &gt; 5 SD; p&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC was the best diagnostic criterion for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that determination of anti-beta2-GPI in addition to aCL and LAC is unlikely to improve the diagnosis of APS in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
