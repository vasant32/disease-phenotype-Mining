<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fetal loss and other clinical manifestations of APS were prevented in the group of APS mice upon exposure to the enriched n-3 diet compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The titers of anti-betaGPI were significantly lower (in O.D. at 405 nm, 1.387+/-0.232 in comparison to non-treated mice 0.637+/-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>111, P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduced titer of anti-betaGPI antibodies in the sera of the treated mice was associated with a reduced number of anti-betaGPI forming cells in cultured splenocytes (84+/-14, antibody-forming cells (AFC)/10(5)cells in comparison to 37+/-4 AFC/10(5)cells (P&lt; 0.02).In addition to the suppression of the humoral response in mice with experimental APS fed with linseed oil, we also observed an inhibitory effect on the cellular response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T-cell response to anti-betaGPI was lower in comparison to mice immunized with H-3 anti-betaGPI mAB, which were kept on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> may improve clinical and laboratory parameters of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of diets enriched with n-3 should be further examined as a potential mode of therapy for patients with APS </plain></SENT>
