<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin time (PT) is routinely used to monitor oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fact that PT is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL)-dependent coagulation test raises the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) might interfere with this test, thus complicating the control of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of 6 affinity-purified preparations of anti- (a)beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (GPI) antibodies with LA activity on the PT was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instead of prolonging PT as expected, the abeta2-GPI antibodies reduced the PT of both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma and anticoagulated plasma by a mean of 2.4 seconds and 5.6 seconds, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This effect was also observed using other 5 commercially available preparations of thromboplastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abeta2-GPI-mediated reduction in PT was dose-dependent and was lost upon removal of beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The failure of abeta2-GPI antibodies to express LA activity in PT was found to depend on the fact that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> were added together with PL at the beginning of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, modification of the standard diluted Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) test by adding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> together with PL resulted in a loss of abeta2-GPI <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procoagulant effect was not as evident in an assay that used stimulated monocytes as a source of thromboplastin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that abeta2-GPI antibodies exhibit an 'in vitro' procoagulant effect in PT and an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect in dRVVT only when the interaction with their antigen and PL occurs in the absence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
