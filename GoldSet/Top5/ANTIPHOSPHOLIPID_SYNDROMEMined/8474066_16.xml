<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 800 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 37 were found to have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> of bone (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Routine radiological screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> joints was not performed and these 37 represented symptomatic patients only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of these were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both aPL positive and aPL negative patients had received large doses of oral steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was higher in the aPL positive group, but this did not reach statistical significance, perhaps because of the small numbers of patients involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the difference in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was more marked in the aPL positive group (p &lt; 0.08), once again, this was not statistically significant at the 5% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the prevalence of aPL positivity in the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> population is about 30-40%, the presence of the aPL may be associated with an increased tendency to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is supported by recent reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> occurring in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in the absence of previous steroid administration </plain></SENT>
