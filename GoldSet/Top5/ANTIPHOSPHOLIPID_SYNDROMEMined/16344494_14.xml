<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been described in patients with primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (PSV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of APS in patients with PSV attending a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> clinic and the prevalence of patients with positive aCL and/or the LA who do not fulfil the classification criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> case notes of patients attending the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> clinic over a 12 month period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outpatients and inpatients were both included and were assessed for features of the APS and presence of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive aCL or LA tests were classified according to the significance of these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 144 patients with PSV, 25 had positive aCL or LA on at least one occasion, representing a point prevalence of 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, nine had definite APS (classified by the Sapporo criteria) and a further four patients had clinical and serological features of APS, although insufficient to satisfy the Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
