<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cultured HUVECs were incubated with pooled plasma from third-trimester pregnant women with the addition (20 mg/mL) of MaCL with anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I activity that was obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), MaCL from an individual without APS, or from a control patient with immunoglobulin M without aCL activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Supernatants were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated factors XII and VII, prothrombin-fragment 1 + 2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA), and differentiating 2 chain UPA were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cultured HUVEC supernatants, the addition of MaCL increased activated factor VII and prothrombin-fragment 1 + 2, did not modify UPA, and decreased activated factor XII and differentiating 2 chain UPA, in comparison with samples with control immunoglobulin M added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MaCL without APS activity did not change any parameter that was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MaCL with anti-beta-2 activity that was obtained from patients with APS may interfere in the activation of the contact complex during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
