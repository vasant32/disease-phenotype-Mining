<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 3 adolescents who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> as the first manifestation of probable catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients, 2 male patients and 1 female patient were 14 to 18 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> in the past, but the other 2 had no previous relevant medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> presented with excruciating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> without additional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physical examination was noncontributory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory results were remarkable for high inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasonography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and abdominal computed tomography scan showed nonspecific findings of liver infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only computed tomography angiography revealed evidence of extensive multiorgan <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had elevated titers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with full heparinization, high-dose steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin with a resolution of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient was resistant to the treatment and was treated with rituximab </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion with prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent severe morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
