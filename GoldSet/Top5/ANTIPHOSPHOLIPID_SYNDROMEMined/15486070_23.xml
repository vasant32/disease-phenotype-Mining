<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently found that CD4(+) T cells autoreactive to beta(2)GPI in patients with APS preferentially recognize a cryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> encompassing amino acid residues 276-290 (p276-290), which contains the major PL-binding site, in the context of DR53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear how previously cryptic p276-290 becomes visible to the immune system and elicits a pathogenics <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> to beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that presentation of a disease-relevant cryptic T-cell determinant in beta(2)GPI is induced as a direct consequence of antigen processing from beta(2)GPI bound to anionic PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dendritic cells or macrophages pulsed with PL-bound beta(2)GPI induced a response of p276-290-specific CD4(+) T-cell lines generated from the patients in an HLA-DR-restricted and antigen-processing-dependent manner but those with beta(2)GPI or PL alone did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the p276-290-reactive T-cell response was primed by stimulating peripheral blood T cells from DR53-carrying healthy individuals with dendritic cells bearing PL-bound beta(2)GPI in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our finding is the first demonstration of an in vitro mechanism eliciting pathogenic autoreactive T-cell responses to beta(2)GPI and should be useful in clarifying the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
