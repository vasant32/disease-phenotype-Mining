<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta 2 glycoprotein I (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> H, beta 2GPI) is involved in the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>(s) recognized by clinically relevant autoantibodies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the binding of beta 2GPI to chemically activated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> in a microtitre plate format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adsorption isotherms (at 37 degrees C) were generated for beta 2GPI on activated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> and on unactivated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi>, with both human serum antibodies and rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies as probes, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-tagged anti-IgG to detect binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, beta 2GPI was biotinylated and isotherms were developed by using HRP-streptavidin as the recognition sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human serum autoantibodies, which did not precipitate beta 2GPI in solution, yielded a characteristic chemisorption isotherm on activated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> but did not recognize beta 2GPI bound to untreated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rabbit IgG, which did precipitate beta 2GPI in solution, detected beta 2GPI bound to both activated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> and, to a lesser extent, to untreated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of beta 2GPI to untreated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> was confirmed by the use of biotinylated beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the prevalence of IgG anti-beta 2GPI autoantibodies, we surveyed 113 sera submitted to our laboratory for anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only nine (8%) had anti-beta 2GPI activity greater than two standard deviations above the mean for those sera in which aCL activity was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> presentation of beta 2GPI for human autoantibody binding is dependent on surface properties of the <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi>, and that beta 2GPI autoantibodies are found only in a subpopulation of sera positive for aCL </plain></SENT>
