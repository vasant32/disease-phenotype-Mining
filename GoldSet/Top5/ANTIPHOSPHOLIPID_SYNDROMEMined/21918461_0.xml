<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature review was performed to estimate test performance, effect sizes, and treatment effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electronic searches were performed through April 2011, with review of references from included articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>English-language studies addressed analytic validity, clinical validity, and/or clinical utility and satisfied predefined inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate evidence showed high analytic sensitivity and specificity for F5 and F2 testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence for clinical validity was adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The summary odds ratio for association of recurrent pregnancy loss with F5 in case-control studies was 2.02 (95% confidence interval, 1.60-2.55), with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and suggestion of publication bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies in women with recurrent pregnancy loss or unselected cohorts showed F5 carriers were more likely to have a subsequent loss than noncarriers (odds ratios: 1.93 and 2.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results for F2 testing were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For clinical utility, evidence was adequate that anticoagulation treatments were ineffective (except in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome) and had treatment-associated harms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The certainty of evidence is moderate (high, moderate, and low) that anticoagulation of women with recurrent pregnancy loss and F5/F2 variants would currently lead to net harms </plain></SENT>
