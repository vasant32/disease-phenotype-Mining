<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests that autoantibodies to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) may contribute to upregulation of the tissue factor (TF) pathway of blood coagulation and the development of thrombotic complications in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the influence of aPL e.g. anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2GPI) and anti-prothrombin, on in vitro TF-induced thrombin generation in the presence and absence of TFPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: IgG fractions were collected from subjects with aPL (n=21) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-TFPI activity was determined after incubation of IgG isolated from control or subject plasma with pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma using an amidolytic assay for TFPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influence of IgG fractions and purified aPL (anti-beta2GPI and anti-prothrombin) on TF-induced in vitro thrombin generation was determined using a chromogenic assay of thrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with aPL had significantly elevated thrombin generation (median [interquartile range]) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (112.0 [104.0-124.0]% vs 89.9 [85.7-100.9]%, respectively; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombin generation was significantly correlated with anti-TFPI activity in patients with aPL (r(s)=0.452; p=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also demonstrated that anti-beta2GPI, but not anti-prothrombin IgG antibodies, significantly enhanced TF-induced thrombin generation in the presence of TFPI, using both purified and patients' samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that anti-beta2GPI IgG antibodies accelerate thrombin generation in the presence of TFPI and may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in patients with aPS </plain></SENT>
