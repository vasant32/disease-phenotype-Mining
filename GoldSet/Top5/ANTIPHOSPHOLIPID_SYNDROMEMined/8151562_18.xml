<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It is accepted that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is due to the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since phosphatidylserine is a negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, we tried to demonstrate the pathogenic role of antiphosphatidylserine in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used affinity purified IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies from sera of 2 patients with APS characterized by recurrent thromboembolic phenomena, recurrent fetal loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (aPTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient the antiphosphatidylserine Abs were the main <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) while the 2nd patient also had pathogenic aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified antibodies were passively infused into the tail vein of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice were mated and we followed them for manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Passive infusion of IgG but not IgM antiphosphatidylserine antibodies to pregnant ICR mice resulted in increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate (40%), lower mean weights of the placentae and fetuses and prolonged aPTT (82 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were detected in the placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the pathogenic role of antiphosphatidylserine antibodies and emphasize the importance of looking for the presence of antiphosphatidylserine Abs in sera of patients with clinical manifestations compatible with APS even in the absence of aCL Abs </plain></SENT>
