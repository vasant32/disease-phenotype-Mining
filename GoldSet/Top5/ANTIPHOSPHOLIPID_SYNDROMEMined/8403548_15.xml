<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After showing the binding of IVGG to mouse and human ACA (e.g., the existence of natural anti-idiotypic autoantibodies to ACA) we infused 36 micrograms of IVGG to the tail vein of mice in which experimental APLS was induced by passive transfer of monoclonal mouse ACA (CAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice treated with IVGG had significantly less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> when mated, in comparison to untreated mice (5-13 +/- 6% vs 25 +/- 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best results were achieved when IVGG was given 2 days after induction of the disease (on Day 6 of pregnancy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It seems that IVGG may be employed as a good adjunct to any therapy of APLS </plain></SENT>
