<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) with the development of clinical thrombotic manifestations and to characterize the efficacy of anti-thrombotic therapies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 272 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient files and a cumulative database were used to collect patients' medical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) were measured according to international recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New thrombotic events were registered during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were prospectively studied for 5 years, of whom 107 were aPL negative (aPL- group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were fulfilled by 84 of 165 aPL-positive patients (APS+ group) indicating that SLE patients with aPL have around 50% risk to develop thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aPL+ group (n = 81) consisted of aPL+ but APS- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LAC was the most common aPL (n = 27, 32.1%) in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative presence of aPL further increased the prevalence of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, aPL developed in 8 of 107 patients (7.5%) from the aPL- group, of whom 3 (2.8%) presented with thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other types of aPL developed in 7 of 165 (4.2%) aPL+ patients within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New thrombotic events occurred in 3.7% of aPL+ (n = 3) and 8.3% (n = 7) of the APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 52 of 81 aPL+ patients received primary prophylaxis, and 1 (1.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the non-treatment group, 2 (6.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine of 84 of the APS patients received secondary prophylaxis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in 2 patients (on cumarine therapy maintaining an international normalized ratio around 2.5-3.0), and 5 suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (1 on aspirin and 4 on aspirin + cumarine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the importance of determining both aCL and abeta2GPI antibodies and LAC in SLE patients and the need for adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
