<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with SLE and 36 with primary APS were enrolled in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IgG and IgM aCL, anti-beta(2)GPI, and antiprothrombin antibodies and IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(2), and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(3) were determined by standard enzymatic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PON activity was assessed by quantification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi> formation, and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(2), and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(3) were reduced in patients with SLE compared with controls (mean +/- SD 0.51 +/- 0.3, 0.37 +/- 0.3, and 0.14 +/- 0.1 mmoles/liter, respectively, versus 1.42 +/- 0.9, 1.01 +/- 0.7, and 0.40 +/- 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with SLE and primary APS had higher titers of anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> antibodies and lower PON activity than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SLE population, PON activity was inversely correlated with IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> titers (r = -0.48, P = 0.005) whereas in the primary APS population, IgG anti-beta(2)GPI was the only independent predictor of PON activity (r = -0.483, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the SLE group, anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was inversely correlated with <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> (r = -0.40, P &lt; 0.02), and PON activity was positively correlated with <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> (r = 0.43, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies are associated with reduced PON activity in patients with SLE and primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since the physiologic role of PON is to prevent <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> oxidation with its attendant atherogenic effects, the reported interactions may be relevant to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in SLE and primary APS </plain></SENT>
