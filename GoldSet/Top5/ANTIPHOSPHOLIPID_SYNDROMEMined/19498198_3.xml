<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is associated with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, the presence of aPL is associated with ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Combined data from 2 major substudies of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trial (WARSS) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PICSS subjects were included if they were enrolled in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (APASS) and underwent a baseline aPL test (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin antibodies, or both) within 1 month of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in PICSS underwent transesophageal echocardiography for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> as well as VaT, which was performed blinded to aPL status and treatment arm (325 mg/day aspirin or adjusted dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>; target international normalized ratio, 1.4-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome event was the 2-year risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because there was no treatment effect, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin groups were combined to increase power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the combined end point, power to detect HR of 2 was 47.8% for the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and aPL-positive group, and 75.3% for the valve thickening and aPL-positive group, assuming 2-sided type I error of 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-five subjects were tested for the combined presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and aPL and were available for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome event rate was 23.9% (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.75-2.59) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-positive/aPL-positive group, compared to 13.9% (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.44-1.56) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-positive/aPL-negative group, and 19.9% (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.68-1.90) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>-negative/aPL-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five hundred forty-five subjects tested for combined presence of aPL and left-side cardiac VaT were available for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The primary event rate was 22.6% (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 0.88-3.09) in the VaT-positive/aPL-positive group, compared to 19.4% (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.82-2.75) in the VaT-positive/aPL-negative group, and 20.2% (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.81-3.25) in the VaT-negative/aPL-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined presence of aPL either with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> or with left-side cardiac VaT did not significantly increase risk of subsequent cerebrovascular events in this PICCS/APASS cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
