<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of anti-C-reactive protein (CRP) autoantibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and non-SLE patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and their association with clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera of 137 patients with SLE, 127 with persistent aPL and 30 with idiopathic venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, were assayed for the presence of anti-CRP reactivity by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations of anti-CRP reactivity with clinical features, with other autoantibodies, and with serum concentrations of C3 and CRP were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antibodies against CRP were seen in 51% (n = 137) of patients with SLE and in 54% (n = 127) of patients with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with anti-CRP antibodies showed increased frequencies of anti-dsDNA and aPL antibodies compared to those without anti-CRP (52% vs 26% and 68% vs 31%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean serum C3 levels were lower in the subgroup of patients with SLE positive for anti-CRP antibodies (79 +/- 25 vs 92 +/- 25 mg/dl; p = 0.004 ) and mean serum CRP levels were significantly higher (13 +/- 17 vs 5 +/- 8 mg/l; p = 0.01 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> was higher in SLE patients with anti-CRP antibodies, than in those without (27% vs 13%; p = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with clinical and serological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) the frequency of anti-CRP antibodies was significantly higher than in asymptomatic aPL carriers, in both SLE patients [85% (23 of 27) vs 59% (19 of 32); p = 0.021] and non-SLE patients [76% (38 of 50) vs 19% (9 of 47); p &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with APS with or without SLE, 26 had arterial events, 31 had venous events, 6 had combined arterial and venous events, and 14 had fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean titers of IgG anti-CRP (29 +/- 21, 30 +/- 19, 60 +/- 37, and 26 +/- 12 AU/ml) and frequencies of anti-CRP antibodies (88%, 71%, 50%, and 71%) in these subgroups of patients were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We confirmed the high prevalence of anti-CRP autoantibodies both in patients with SLE and in non-SLE and aPL-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed that the presence of these antibodies was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and with clinical features of the APS in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
