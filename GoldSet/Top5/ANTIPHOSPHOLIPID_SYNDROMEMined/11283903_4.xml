<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLS) has been recognized as the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, APLS-induced BCS has been seen rarely in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgical strategy for BCS depends on the patency of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 10-year-old boy with a diagnosis of BCS complicated with IVC obstruction caused by APLS received medical treatment and radiologic intervention for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spite of these treatments, no relief of the symptoms could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the patient underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), which required cavoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He has had an uneventful course since the LDLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IVC-obstructed BCS associated with APLS seems to be a good indication for LDLT with cavoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because liver transplantation (LT) itself is not a cure for APLS, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> cannot be eliminated entirely by LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although immunosuppression may influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production, long-term observation and life-long <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is needed even after LT </plain></SENT>
