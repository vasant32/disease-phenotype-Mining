<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several attempts have been made to alter the progression of various atopic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> in which the immune system plays a major role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied this issue in an animal model of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) by supplementing the animals' daily intake with a probiotic mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of nutritional supplementation of a commercial product that consists of 10(8)/ml Lactobacillus casei (Actimel) on Balb/c mice that were immunized with beta-2- <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (beta2GPI) in order to induce a familiar murine model of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As controls, we used similar animals that were fed with either yogurt or sham solution as a supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effect of Actimel on the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-10 interferon gamma (IFNgamma) as well as the extent of the primary T cell response to beta2GPI, and the levels of autoantibodies to beta2GPI determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after priming (in the hind footpad) of Balb/c mice with beta2GPI, we analyzed the cytokine profile of the animals by measuring the concentration of IL-10 and IFNgamma in the supernatants of lymphocytes that were extracted from the popliteal lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following stimulation with 10 microg/mL of beta2GPI, we noticed significant (P &lt; 0.05) suppression of IL-10 production by the stimulated lymphocytes in the animals fed with Actimel and yogurt in comparison to sham solution (73.42 +/- 29.4, 84.7 +/- 8, 196 +/- 41.62 pg/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both dairy products enhanced the secretion of IFNgamma from 657 +/- 47.09 pg/mL to 896 +/- 78.1, and 933 +/- 76.7 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively; similarly they also accelerated by a mild degree the level of the T cell primary response to beta2GPI measured by [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of autoantibodies to beta2GPI was suppressed in mice fed with actimel and yogurt in a significant manner (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actimel as well as yogurt confer an immunological impact on Balb/c mice immunized with beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actimel was able not only to enhance IFNgamma secretion but also to inhibit IL-10 production </plain></SENT>
