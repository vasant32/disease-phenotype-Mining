<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They had had no (10/19, 53%) or just one prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and did not have a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many (8/19, 42%) had had a prior uncomplicated pregnancy ending in a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These women were randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were few obstetric complications recorded in either treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One woman in the aspirin group had a fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and one in the usual care group had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low-birth-weight</z:hpo> infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of complications was so low that &gt; 600 such women would need to be entered into a randomized trial to evaluate whether low-dose aspirin would be beneficial treatment during a pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that treatment of pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> who are otherwise at low risk cannot be justified on the basis of the available evidence </plain></SENT>
