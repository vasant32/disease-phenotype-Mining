<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of the inherited polymorphisms of genes encoding proteins involved in the coagulation cascade is one of the possible causes of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent years, protein Z (PZ) and PZ-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (ZPI) have been added to the list of prothrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PZ is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> serving as a cofactor of ZPI, which is responsible for the inhibition of prothrombinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the PZ gene is under the control of many transcriptional factors; several polymorphisms alternate the rate of gene expression </plain></SENT>
