<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The tolerogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, hCDR1, ameliorated manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) via the immunomodulation of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because type I interferon (IFN-α) has been implicated to play a role in SLE pathogenesis, we investigated the effects of hCDR1 on IFN-α in a murine model of SLE and in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: (NZBxNZW)F1 mice with established SLE were treated with hCDR1 (10 weekly injections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Splenocytes were obtained for gene expression studies by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>hCDR1 down-regulated significantly IFN-α gene expression (73% inhibition compared to vehicle treated mice, p = 0.002) in association with diminished clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, hCDR1 reduced, in vitro, IFN-α gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 lupus patients (74% inhibition compared to medium, p = 0.002) but had no significant effects on the expression levels of IFN-α in PBMC of primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome patients or of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> patients were treated for 24 weeks with hCDR1 (5) or placebo (4) by weekly subcutaneous injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood samples collected, before and after treatment, were frozen until <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in IFN-α was determined in hCDR1 treated patients (64.4% inhibition compared to pretreatment expression levels, p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No inhibition was observed in the placebo treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In agreement, treatment with hCDR1 resulted in a significant decrease of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IFN-α appears to play a role in the mechanism of action of hCDR1 since recombinant IFN-α diminished the immunomodulating effects of hCDR1 on IL-1β, TGFβ and FoxP3 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE: We reported previously that hCDR1 affected various cell types and immune pathways in correlation to disease amelioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present studies demonstrate that hCDR1 is also capable of down-regulating significantly (and specifically to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>) IFN-α gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, hCDR1 has a potential role as a novel, disease specific treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
