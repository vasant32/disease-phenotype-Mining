<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much of the debate is related to the use of polyclonal antibodies during the different antiphospholipid assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, a strategy was designed to analyze the reactivity of each one antibody making up the polyclonal anticardiolipin activity, breaking down this reactivity at the clonal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was performed in a single patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> by combining (1) the antigen-specific selection of single cells sorted by flow cytometry using structurally bilayered labeled anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and (2) the cloning of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes originating from individual IgG anticardiolipin-specific B cells by a single-cell polymerase chain reaction technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corresponding V regions were cloned in order to express human recombinant antibodies in insect cells by a baculovirus expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular analysis, the fine specificity, and the protein cofactor dependency of the first 5 monoclonal IgG anticardiolipins are reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This clonal analysis reveals the extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of these antibodies, which could account for the difficulties in the previous attempts to define the pathogenic antiphospholipid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach should help to unravel the complex antiphospholipid immune response and the mechanism of the prothrombotic state associated with these antibodies, but it could also shed some light on their possible origins </plain></SENT>
