<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A review of a hematological database with chart review was undertaken to identify patients on LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Levels were drawn monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were considered suboptimal if prophylactic and therapeutic doses of LMWH had an anti-Xa value &lt;0.2 U/mL and 0.6 U/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables of interest included age, parity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 30 patients, three required therapeutic-dose LMWH and 27 were on prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six percent on a therapeutic dose required a dose change, whereas 11% on a prophylactic dose were changed (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the variables were predictive of a need for change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One thromboembolic event was noted while on prophylactic-dose LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No single variable is predictive of a need for dose change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients on a therapeutic dose were more likely to need change </plain></SENT>
