<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we analysed the plasma of 10 patients with aPL antibodies, and were able to demonstrate that in four patients with both clotting test reactivities, the dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (dRVVT) activity can be separated from the dilute Kaolin Clotting Time (dKCT) reactivity by using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi>-immobilised phosphatidylserine column but not with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differential reactivity of the autoantibodies in this patient population is not due to binding to beta2GPI, prothrombin or protein C in solid-phase immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence LA antibodies detected in different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent clotting tests detect different populations of antibodies in some APS patients and the routine detection of LA antibodies should be performed with at least two clotting tests looking at different coagulation reactions </plain></SENT>
