<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither the prevalence nor the natural history of AH due to HIT are known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to identify the spectrum of AH causes, to characterise the frequency of AH due to HIT and determine the natural history of HIT-associated AH </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over this time frame, there were a total of 115 patients with AH of which 11 cases (10%; mean ag e 67 Â± 8 years; 73% female) were associated with HIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one occurred in the postoperative setting and involved both adrenal glands (89%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000846'>adrenal insufficiency</z:hpo> at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were found incidentally during an evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or mental status changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HIT patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> at other locations including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e> (n=14), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> (n= 4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty had "spontaneous HIT" with AH in the absence of identifiable <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other causes of AH included trauma (29%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (15%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (10%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AH is an important but seldom recognised presumed thrombotic complication of HIT, which usually occurs in the postoperative period, especially after orthopaedic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This syndrome can occur in the apparent absence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> exposure, especially following major joint replacement surgery </plain></SENT>
