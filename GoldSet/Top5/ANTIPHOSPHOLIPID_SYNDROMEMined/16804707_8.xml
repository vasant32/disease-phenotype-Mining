<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which patients on hydroxychloroquine therapy underwent automated 10-2 threshold static visual field examination and mfERG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-parametric unadjusted and age-adjusted Spearman correlation coefficients rho were calculated between the cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine and the visual field mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) values; and the mfERG response amplitudes and peak latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis was also performed between the visual field MD and PSD values and the mfERG response amplitudes and peak latencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26 eyes in 13 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of hydroxychloroquine therapy was 4.9 years and the mean cumulative dose was 574 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between the cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine and the visual field MD and PSD values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between the cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine and mfERG N1 and P1 response amplitudes for the central rings (ring 1-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correlations between the dose of hydroxychloroquine and mfERG N1 and P1 response amplitudes were strongest for the paracentral ring 2 (rho =-0.63 and rho =-0.62, respectively, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were also found between the visual field MD values and mfERG response amplitudes of various ring eccentricities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients on hydroxychloroquine, mfERG response amplitude correlated with both the 10-2 visual field MD values and with the cumulative dose of hydroxychloroquine used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of mfERG can provide objective measurement of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> function in patients on hydroxychloroquine and may provide supplementary quantitative information to visual field findings </plain></SENT>
