<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data on pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are very sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the main clinical characteristics, laboratory data and complications of pediatric APS patients, and to analyze the differences between primary APS and APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data of 32 children at the Federico Gomez children's hospital in Mexico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had SLE, 12 (37.5%) had primary APS and 1 (3%) had immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We collected information on sociodemographic variables, vaccinations, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> and non-thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunological features included immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, IgG and IgM anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and anti-dsDNA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients included 24 females and 8 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common thrombotic events were small vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (44%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (28%) mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) in lower extremities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical non-thrombotic manifestations were hematological (53%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, nonthrombotic clinical manifestations or laboratory features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were some important differences between the clinical manifestations of APS in children compared with adults, but we found no significant differences between patients with primary and APS associated with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger studies in Latin American APS children are necessary to determine whether there are differences between ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
