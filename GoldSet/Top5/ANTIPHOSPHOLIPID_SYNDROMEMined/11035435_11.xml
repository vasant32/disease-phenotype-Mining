<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated during the visit by looking at 100 variables such as demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, therapeutical, behavioral, (compliance), emotional (Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory), disease activity, (Mex-SLEDAI), disease severity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> SDI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> damage (SLICC-ACR), and physician's and patient's global assessments of severity </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance was set at the 0.05 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>180 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>164 were female, mean age 31.7/11.39 y, mean Mex SLEDAI score 3.8, mean SLICC-ACR 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo>, poliarthralgia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> were the main causes of consultation with 26, 25 and 18 cases each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>49 patients were hospitalized and these were statistically different than non-hospitalized patients in level of formal education (10.2 vs 11.8, P=0.03); compliance (7.6 vs 9, P=0.0001); malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (57% vs 82%, OR, 95% CI=0.28, 0.13-0.62, P=0.0008), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> daily dose intake (45 vs 77 mg, P=0.04); disease severity in physician's global assessments (5.6 vs 2.1, P=0.0001) and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory (21 vs 16, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression identified physician's global assessment, fewer ACR criteria and higher SLICC-ACR scores as the main variables associated with hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients died; two with community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, multiple thromboses, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, one with <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp>; and one with pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, poor compliance, low level of formal education, severity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, lower ACR criteria and higher SLICC-ACR scores were important variables identified with hospitalization </plain></SENT>
