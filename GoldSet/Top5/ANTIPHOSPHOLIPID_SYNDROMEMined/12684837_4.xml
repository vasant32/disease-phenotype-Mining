<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen female PAPS patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations and hypoperfusion lesions demonstrated on initial (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images were performed 1 month after ACT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before ACT, 14 (87.5%) patients had positive ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After ACT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 PAPS patients showed decreased serologic findings, and their neuropsychiatric manifestations subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After ACT, 11 (68.8%) patients showed complete recovery of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and five (31.2%) patients showed partial recovery in the follow-up (99m)Tc HMPAO brain SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This type of imaging is a logical and objective tool for measuring the effects of ACT in PAPS patients with brain involvement by determining changes in rCBF </plain></SENT>
