<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight PAPS and five SLE-APS patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient the evaluation was based on anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody levels, nailfold capillaroscopy, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fluorangiography and transcranial doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis has been performed using chi 2 analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological alterations of capillary loops, venular visibility and sludging of blood were often observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While we found in higher prevalence a variability of capillary loop length in PAPS patients, the SLE-APL group significantly differed for the presence of microhaemorrhages (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we evaluated the clinical history, a marked microcirculatory damage was related with the occurrence of thrombotic manifestations in the PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody levels, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fluorangiography and transcranial doppler sonography did not correlate with clinical history in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nailfold capillaroscopy can be usefully employed in the differentiation between primary and SLE-associated anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, and it can help to identify the patients at higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
