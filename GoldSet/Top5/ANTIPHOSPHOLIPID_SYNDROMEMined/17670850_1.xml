<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate immunological specificities and functional activities of aPS/PT, four monoclonal aPS/PT, designated as HG-4, KE-6, KF-5 and KF-6, from two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) were established and characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of these antibodies (HG-4, KF-5 and KF-6) recognized the complex of phosphatidylserine and prothrombin, but did not react to prothrombin directly coated on oxygenated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KE-6 bound not only to the complex of phosphatidylserine and prothrombin but also to prothrombin on oxygenated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of them showed the binding activity to prothrombin directly coated on non-oxygenated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HG-4, KE-6 and KF-5 had LA-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings support the hypothesis that autoimmune aPS/PT recognize the cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> or neoepitopes exposed upon interaction between prothrombin and phosphatidylserine, and that aPS/PT are, at least in part, responsible for LA activity </plain></SENT>
