<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is one of the main reasons of graft loss following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) is known as a high risk for graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in kidney transplants alone, little is known about APLS in SPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2000 and December 2001, 45 SPK were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment and clinical course of 2 patients with APLS is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one patient, APLS was known before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After SPK, she was treated by systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28794">coumarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both grafts are doing well 5 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second patient underwent SPK without knowledge of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> 5 weeks posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> screening revealed APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grafts were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SPK can successfully be performed in APLS patients if anticoagulation is performed consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To reduce the risk of graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a pretransplant screening for APLS would probably be of benefit </plain></SENT>
