<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), primary or secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), or with SLE, were assayed by immunoblot analysis for anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (abeta2-GPI), and by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) technique for reactivity with astrocyte and neuron cell lines and with histological sections of human brain biopsies and monkey cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six sera from healthy donors were studied as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of the 20 patient sera contained abeta2-GPI and were immunoreactive with astrocytes and neurons, both in culture and in the histological sections, and with the endotheliocytes of the microvessels present in the histological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell localization and the pattern of immune reaction were similar to those obtained with a monoclonal antibody abeta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the remaining patient sera, found abeta2-GPI-, did not react with the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> substrates (and the control sera), while one exhibited immunoreactivity analogous to the abeta2-GPI+ sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interference of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in the immunoreactivity with the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> substrates was excluded since aCL were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient sera and no immune reaction was observed in the histological sections incubated with a monoclonal aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the binding of abeta2-GPI from patients to cells of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) occurs independently from aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This issue may be relevant to further evaluate the potential pathogenetic role of abeta2-GPI in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> damage of APS-like conditions </plain></SENT>
