<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An extracorporeal selective adsorption system using such columns has been developed and clinically used to remove anti-DNA from the circulating blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These columns can adsorb pathogenic anti-DNA subgroups of high avidity and/or cationic antibodies, anticardiolipin, anti-CLbeta2GPI, and anaphylatoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An open clinical study on 19 SLE cases (the mean number of apheresis sessions totaled 3.7 times; the mean dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, 38 mg/day) revealed that the mean SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score significantly decreased from the pretreatment level of 10.2 to 4.5 after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several case reports have indicated that this modality might also be useful for treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compartment model analyses showed the one-compartment model to be the most suitable for the kinetics of anti-DNA during and following the apheresis procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indications for immunoadsorption in the treatment of SLE remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A steroid-sparing effect might be one of them, but further controlled studies are necessary to verify this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
