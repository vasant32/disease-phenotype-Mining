<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conformation of each domain of beta2-GPI was optimized from its crystal structure by energy minimization and by molecular dynamics simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three electrostatic interactions, i.e. D193-K246, D222-K317 and E228-K308, were observed between domains IV and V in the optimized structure that was constructed based on the consensus sequences obtained by the phage-displayed random <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antigenic structures determined by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping mainly consisted of hydrophobic amino acids located on two discontinuous sequences in domain IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These amino acid clusters, as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, were covered by domain V and were of a hidden nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar but incomplete counterpart to the epitopic clusters was found in domain I but was not in domains II or III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding of anti-beta2-GPI auto-antibodies to solid-phase beta2-GPI was significantly reduced either by L replacement for W235, a common amino acid component for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, or by V replacement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of D193, D222 and E228 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis indicated a hypothesis that these electrostatic interactions between domains IV and V retained exposure to W235 and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> spreading occurred in the region surrounding W235 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, epitopic structures recognized by anti-beta2-GPI auto-antibodies are cryptic and inter-domain electrostatic interactions are involved in their in exposure </plain></SENT>
