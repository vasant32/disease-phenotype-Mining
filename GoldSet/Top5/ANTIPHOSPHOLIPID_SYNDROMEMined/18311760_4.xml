<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To verify the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disabilities</z:e> (LDs) in the offspring of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) as a consequence of fetal exposure to maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), and to evaluate the impact of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease on children's development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 17 children of mothers with primary APS using a standardized intelligence test (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised), a specific LD battery of tests (Sartori, MT groups' test for reading ability, MT groups' test for math skills), and a questionnaire on behavioral and social characteristics (Child Behavior Checklist [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mothers were interviewed about their pregnancy and motherhood experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence level (full-scale intelligence quotient &gt;85); 15 pregnancies occurred in mothers with IgG aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LDs were diagnosed in 4 children (26.7%), 2 boys and 2 girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these children was born premature, with a brother also affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four children (26.7%) showed a higher risk to present problems on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> total competence scale and 2 children (13.3%) on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CBCL</z:e> total behavior scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two children were described as <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> (1 had an LD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> families had a good socioeconomic status and educational level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Besides <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> and genetic and environmental factors, the genesis of LDs may also include in utero exposure to aPL, in agreement with described experimental models and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic status does not seem to influence the occurrence of LDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A long-term multidisciplinary followup may improve quality of life in patients with primary APS and their children </plain></SENT>
