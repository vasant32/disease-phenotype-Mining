<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of 10 years, 24 pregnancies in 17 females with SLE in a single center were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal and maternal outcomes were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean patient age was 27.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 24 pregnancies occurred in the period of disease remission at the time of conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>Proteinuria</z:hpo> presented in 12 pregnancies; however, no patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> or deterioration of renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had their disease flare up and delivered <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillborns</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) had a fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no maternal mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean gestation age was 34.3 weeks (range, 17-41 weeks), and the mean birth weight was 2,179 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean APGAR scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One baby with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was born to a mother with positive anti-SSA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were five cases (20.8%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> (41.6%) in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is relatively safe in women with SLE in remission but should be considered as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">high-risk pregnancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>APS is associated with poor pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient needs to cooperate with obstetricians and physicians for optimal disease control and detailed monitoring throughout the gestation </plain></SENT>
