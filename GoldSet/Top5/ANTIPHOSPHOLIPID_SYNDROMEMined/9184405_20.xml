<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of coagulation assays are currently employed for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), many of which are influenced by reagent dependent and methodological variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study lyophilised plasma samples from three subjects with "strong", "weak" and "absent" LA were tested in 220 centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used tests for LA were Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (DRVVT) and Kaolin CLotting Time (KCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median DRVVT ratios were 1.75, 1.17 and 1.10 for the three samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of a strong LA was not detected by 4% of laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis was made by 94% of users of DRVVT and 85% of users of KCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A weak LA was not detected by over half of centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correction was observed on addition of plasma and also in platelet neutralisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis was made by 37% of users of DRVVT and 27% of users of KCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> was falsely considered to be present in a Factor IX deficient plasma by approximately one quarter of laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Amongst users of DRVVT and KCT absence of LA in this sample was correctly reported by 73% and 69% of centres respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of testing for LA in the present study is suboptimal and this is likely to have important clinical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is clearly a need for greater conformity in the selection and performance of LA tests to facilitate accurate diagnosis of this important group of disorders </plain></SENT>
