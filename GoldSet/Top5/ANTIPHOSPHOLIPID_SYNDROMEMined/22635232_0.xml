<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed sera of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> for the occurrence of IgG autoantibodies recognizing galectins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These pluripotent effectors can also bind to apoptotic or necrotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS; n = 104) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE; n = 62) were examined, healthy donors (n = 31) served as controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of anti-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-2(PEP)-IgG were significantly increased in SLE and APS when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with APS showed significantly higher levels of anti-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-2(PEP)-IgG compared with patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-2(PEP)-IgG may, therefore, be considered novel biomarkers for APS </plain></SENT>
