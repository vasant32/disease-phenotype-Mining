<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both of these conditions and RVO, platelet activation occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aspirin, not <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, is the most effective antithrombotic agent in RVO and, taken together, these observations suggest an important role for platelets in this common ocular thrombotic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ia/IIa (GpIa/IIa) is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule mediating platelet-collagen interactions and is key to the initiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, the cellular density of this molecule was shown to be determined by two silent, linked polymorphisms (C807T/G873A) within the GpIa/IIa gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that some of the resulting genotypes are associated with thrombo-embolic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study therefore aimed to establish the prevalence of the GpIa/IIa polymorphisms and the three commonest hereditary thrombophilic disorders (prothrombin gene G20210A (PT) mutation, Factor V Leiden (FVL), and the thermolabile <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T (MTHFR) mutation) in patients with RVO and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GpIa/IIa polymorphisms and thrombophilic abnormalities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified using the polymerase chain reaction.Our results show that the frequency of the GpIa/IIa polymorphisms was similar in our <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control population to previously published series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with RVO, however, had only a 10% (4/40) frequency of the lowest risk subtype (CC/GG) compared to 37.5% (15/40) in the control group-P 0.0039 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the PT, FVL, and MTHFR thrombophilic mutations was not different between the two groups, but interestingly none of the 7/40 RVO cases with a PT, FVL, or MTHFR mutation had the low-risk GpIa/IIa genotype while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the controls did-P&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, 17.5% of RVO patients harboured more than one prothrombotic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The principal difference between the RVO and control group was the very high incidence of the intermediate-risk GpIa/IIa subtype (CT/GA)-82.5 vs 50%, P&amp;&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a major role for GpIa/IIa polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of RVO </plain></SENT>
