<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are patients with aPLS who do not have SLE or any other illness who have been grouped under the term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, patients with diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, may have aPL but do not develop the associated clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has been attributed, at least in part, to the immunochemical features of their aPL, including the requirement for beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta 2GP-I) for binding of aPL to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, but these have not been studied in sera from patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By ELISA we studied 95 sera from 17 patients with PAPS and 100 sera from clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals for IgG and IgM antibodies to the main anionic and zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and their related compounds, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (PA) and synthetic phosphorylcholine (PRC). beta 2GP-I was present, either in newborn calf serum (NBCS) or purified, to block wells and to dilute samples, or was substituted by 0.3% gelatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> micelles were used to confirm reactivities with the corresponding <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients had IgG and 11 had IgM antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were primarily IgG whereas those to zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were mainly, and often exclusively, IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a statistically significant difference in the mean levels of antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> except aPTS, and to the haptene PA (P &lt; 0.001) between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between levels of IgM antibodies to zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> was statistically significant with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) and the haptene (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Levels of most IgG and most IgM aPL correlated significantly among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pattern and titers of reactivity are variable between patients, but stable within each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Requirement of beta 2GP-I for this reactivity was not an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-or-nothing phenomenon in individual sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In general, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> sera, antibodies to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> require that this cofactor be present coating the ELISA plates, whereas those to zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It would appear that patients with PAPS have polyclonal mixtures of antibodies that react with various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and have different requirements for beta 2GP-I for such reactivity </plain></SENT>
