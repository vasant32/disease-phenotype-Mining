<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1990 through 2003 615 pregnant women were identified at 18 hospitals in Norway with a diagnosis of first time VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2006, 531 of 559 eligible cases and 1092 of 1229 eligible controls were invited for further investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final study population comprised 313 cases and 353 controls, who completed a comprehensive questionnaire and donated a single blood sample, 3-16 years after index pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the results on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-ss(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 antibodies alone, in combination, and with the contribution of the factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cut-off values for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> were chosen according to current international consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>29 (9.3%) of the cases and 24 (6.8%) of the controls had at least one positive test for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.8-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine cases (2.8%) and no controls had more than one positive test (multi-positivity) for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After excluding women with factor V Leiden or prothrombin polymorphisms, still 6 cases were multi-positive for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that multi-positivity, but not single-positivity, for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> was weakly associated with a history of ante- and postnatal VT </plain></SENT>
