<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of these studies was to investigate whether the leucocytic ultrafiltrate LeukoNorm Cytochemia, which is approved for the treatment of immunologically-based recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> (RSA), improves treatment results in patients with repetitive IVF or ICSI failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Included in this study were patients with 3 embryo transfers, with at least 8 morphologically good-looking embryos of the categories a and b, and no conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excluded were patients with accompanying <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disorders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000130'>uterine malformations</z:hpo>, and those exhibiting the presence of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and of further autoantibody syndromes (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> [ANA]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated in three prospective, randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies differed with respect to the frequency and timing of the administration of LeukoNorm Cytochemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pregnancy rates in each of the study protocols were generally higher than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the small number of patients (study I: 10 patients), the differences were not always significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of study III, which is still ongoing and in which LeukoNorm Cytochemia has been given on 5 consecutive days starting with the day of oocyte retrieval, are more significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the treatment group of study III the pregnancy rate was 55% as opposed to a rate of 21.2% in the non-treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The administration of LeukoNorm Cytochemia can significantly improve treatment results in patients with repetitive IVF or ICSI failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Currently the most favourable results are observed with a dosage of 1 unit/10 kg on 5 consecutive days, starting with the day of oocyte retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results imply that, in the IVF or ICSI programmes, there exists a group of patients with disturbances in the embryo-maternal dialogue, and therefore no conceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the administration of LeukoNorm Cytochemia can improve the implantation rate of transferred embryos in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that growth factors and cytokines synthesized and secreted by leucocytes have an important influence on embryonic implantation and growth </plain></SENT>
