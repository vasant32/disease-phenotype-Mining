<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> (valvular thickening and/or regurgitation) or potential embolic sources (spontaneous echocontrast and/or vegetations) in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multiplane transesophageal echocardiography was performed consecutively on 40 PAPS PATIENTS: 17 of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 27 with at least one thromboembolic event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>, arterial and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) and 14 with recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cardiac involvement (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> and/or embolic sources) was present in 33/40 (82%) of PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to aCL titer these lesions were revealed in 17/24 (71%) of patients with aCL &lt; or = 40 GPL-U, while these lesions were present in 100% of patients with aCL &gt; 40 GPL-U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and 3 non-infective valve masses or vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolic sources were found in 4/24 (17%) patients with aCL &lt; or = 40 GPL-U, while they were observed in 6/16 (37%) of patients with titer of aCL &gt; 40 GPL-U (chi2 = 10.03, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between mitral valve thickening and aCL antibodies titer (r = 0.5; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valvular lesions are commonly found in PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data showed a significant correlation among aCL titer, mitral leaflets thickening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
