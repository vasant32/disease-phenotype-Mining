<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) have severe involvement of the cardiovascular apparatus and often need surgical interventions to correct these manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies that have looked at the outcomes of cardiothoracic surgeries in APLS patients have reported high rates of perioperative mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the outcomes of adult APLS patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and/or valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also wanted to determine whether aggressive anticoagulation therapy could prevent life threatening thromboembolic complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of nine patients with primary APLS undergoing cardiothoracic surgery between 1985 and 2005 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, operative procedures and one-year clinical outcomes were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five percent of our patients had more than three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> other than APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no mortalities in our case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 89% of our patients developed major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive anticoagulation, 37.5% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> and vena caval <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, redo of CABG surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite aggressive anticoagulation and lack of significant pre-operative co-morbidities, APLS patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery appear to have high rates of post-operative clinical events </plain></SENT>
