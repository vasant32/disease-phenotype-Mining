<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because CL selectively enhances activated protein C/protein S-dependent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activities in purified systems and because CL is not known to be a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma component, we searched for CL in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extracts [<z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> (2:1, vol/vol)] were subjected to analyses by using TLC, analytical HPLC, and MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> component was purified that was indistinguishable from reference CL (M:1448) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When CL in 40 fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extracts (20 males, 20 females) was quantitated by using HPLC, CL (mean +/- SD) was 14.9 +/- 3.7 microgram/ml (range 9.1 to 24.2) and CL was not correlated with phosphatidylserine (3.8 +/- 1.7 microgram/ml), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (64 +/- 20 microgram/ml), or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (1,580 +/- 280 microgram/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on studies of fasting blood donors, CL (&gt;/=94%) was recovered in very low density, low density, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (11 +/- 5.3%, 67 +/- 11.0%, and 17 +/- 10%, respectively), showing that the majority of plasma CL (67%) is in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of relative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> contents of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> indicated that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> is selectively enriched in CL and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results shows that CL is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma component and suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> could include CL or oxidized CL in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> or in complexes with plasma proteins (e. g., beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, prothrombin, protein C, or protein S) or with platelet or endothelial surface proteins </plain></SENT>
