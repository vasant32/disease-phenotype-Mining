<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is diverse, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, especially hematopoietic in origin, is the most common underlying disease of BMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective analysis, cases with BMN were re-evaluated for etiology, histopathologic details, and clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the last 8 years, 23 cases of BMN were detected among the 1,083 bone marrow (BM) biopsies, and the prevalence was found to be 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of these 23 cases with BMN were children, and 20 cases were in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these cases (80%) had underlying malignant disease, and four (20%) had nonmalignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the malignant cases, three cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), four had relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), two had non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL), three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) associated with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>/myeloproliferative syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/MPS) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common laboratory findings were variable and associated with underlying disease, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and high LDH and alkaline phosphatase levels were detected in the majority of the cases, as was also seen in other series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMN was graded according to the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the BM biopsy, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was extensive in 12 cases, moderate in five cases, and mild in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased reticulin was found in 16 cases; four cases had severe, eight had moderate, and four had mild <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and this was found to be an interesting accompanying finding in BMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> is the most common cause of BMN but some nonmalignant conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> and APS may be the underlying cause of BMN </plain></SENT>
