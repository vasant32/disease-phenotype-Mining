<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its downstream nuclear transcription factors have not been well explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we further investigated whether nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein (AP-1) were activated and their roles in anti-β2GPI/β2GPI complex stimulating TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that treatment of the cells with anti-β2GPI (10μg/ml)/β2GPI (100 mg/ml) complex could markedly increase the levels of phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB p65) and c-Jun/AP-1 (p-c-Jun), as well as TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (20 μM) and AP-1 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> (25 mM) could attenuate TF expression induced by anti-β2GPI/β2GPI or APS-IgG/β2GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination of any two inhibitors of MAPKs (SB203580/U0126 or SB203580/SP600125 or U0126/SP600125) could decrease activation of NF-κB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SB203580/SP600125 or U0126/SP600125, but not SB203580/U0126, could reduce the phosphorylation of c-Jun/AP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither NF-κB nor c-Jun/AP-1 activation caused by anti-β2GPI/β2GPI complex could be affected by TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results indicate that both NF-κB and c-Jun/AP-1 can be activated and play important roles in the process of anti-β2GPI/β2GPI-induced TF expression in monocytes, thereby contributing to the pathological processes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
