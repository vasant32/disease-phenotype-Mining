<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although controversial, some authorities have implicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) as a cause of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (anti-CLAbs) in APLS are cofactor-dependent ('pathogenic' antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study in order to determine the prevalence of anti-CLAbs in HCV patients, and furthermore to address whether these autoantibodies are cofactor-dependent or not and whether they are associated with features of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) were also evaluated in order to assess whether there are differences in the prevalence and the clinical significance of anti-CLAbs between these two major types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four consecutive HCV patients, 50 HBV patients and 267 healthy were investigated for the presence of anti-CLAbs and antibodies against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI), which is the most important cofactor of the 'pathogenic' anti-CLAbs in APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-CLAbs were determined by an in-house quantitative ELISA and anti-beta2-GPIAbs using a commercial ELISA kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21.3% of the HCV and 14% of the HBV patients tested positive for IgG anti-CLAbs (P &lt; 0.0001 compared with healthy controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither age, sex, certain epidemiologic and laboratory parameters nor the clinical status and the histologic findings were associated with anti-CLAbs detection in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2.3% of the HCV (P &lt; 0.05 compared with healthy controls) and 2% of the HBV patients tested positive for anti-beta2-GPIAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presence of anti-CLAbs was not associated with features of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of the HCV and HBV patients had detectable IgG anti-CLAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the anti-CLAbs titres were relatively low, and in most cases seem to be cofactor-independent ('nonpathogenic') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter is further supported by the lack of their association with clinical features of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, anti-CLAbs appear to be detected irrespective of the demographic, laboratory, clinical and histologic status in both HCV and HBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, prospective studies of longer duration may be required in order to address whether anti-CLAbs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> are or are not of clinical importance </plain></SENT>
