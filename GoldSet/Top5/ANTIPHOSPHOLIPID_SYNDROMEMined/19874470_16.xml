<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data examined patients referred to Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> Centers that were diagnosed with definite APS and tested positive for aPL [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) antibodies] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data were confirmed in a central reference laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and sixty patients were enrolled in this cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The qualifying events at diagnosis were venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (76 cases; 47.5%), arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (69 cases; 43.1%) and pregnancy morbidity (11 cases; 9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients (2.5%) suffered from catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in the follow-up period was 12.2% (95% CI, 9.6-14.8) after 1 year, 26.1% (95% CI, 22.3-29.9) after 5 years and 44.2% (95% CI, 38.6-49.8) after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was significantly higher in those patients not taking oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> as compared with those on treatment (HR=2.4 95% CI 1.3-4.1; P&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> associated with oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was low (0.8% patient/years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients died (seven were cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS and triple positivity for aPL are at high risk of developing future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrence remains frequent despite the use of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, which significantly reduces the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
