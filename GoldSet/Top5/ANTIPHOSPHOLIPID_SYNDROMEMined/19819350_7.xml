<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Since characterization of the extent to which particular combinations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (ADs) occur in excess of that expected by chance may offer new insights into possible common pathophysiological mechanisms, polyautoimmunity (i.e., ADs co-occurring within patients) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and its associated factors were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 335 consecutive patients with SLE and the history of 22 ADs were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A systematic literature review was done and results were grouped by hierarchical cluster procedure analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 136 (41%) SLE patients presenting with at least one other AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 191 ADs were observed, of which the most frequent were autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> (AITD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (SS), registered in 60 (18%), 48 (14%) and 47 (14%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of a total number of 1515 SLE patients with polyautoimmunity (1379 reported previously and 136 informed here) there were 77 (5.1%) cases with multiple autoimmune syndrome (i.e., two or more ADs in addition to SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female gender, articular involvement, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, anti-Ro positivity and patient's origin were risk factors for polyautoimmunity while the presence of anti-RNP antibodies was protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four clusters of ADs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most hierarchical one was composed of AITD, APS, SS, and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Polyautoimmunity is frequent in SLE, and it is influenced by clinical and immunological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings support that clinically different autoimmune phenotypes might share common susceptibility variants </plain></SENT>
