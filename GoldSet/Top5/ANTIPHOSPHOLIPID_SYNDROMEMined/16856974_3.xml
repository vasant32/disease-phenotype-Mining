<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports show an apparent large number of individuals with low to moderate titers of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), particularly of the IgM isotype with no clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of these results is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence of low positive titers of IgM ACA antibodies in a large number (n = 982) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood donors (Group 1) and in a group of 159 individuals &gt; 60 years of age (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of re-defining the currently used cut-off values for the IgM ACA tests was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgM ACA antibodies were tested in three ELISA assays: the Bindazyme Anti-IgM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">Cardiolipin</z:chebi> EIA kit (assay A), an 'in-house' ACA test (assay B), and the APhL ELISA kit (assay C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: THE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range cut-offs were re-calculated using the 95th percentile of the data for Group 1 (12.4 MPL U mL(-1) for assay A, 5.4 MPL U mL(-1) for assay B and 9.5 MPL U mL(-1) for assay C) and Group 2 (9.9 MPL U mL(-1) for assay A, 5.5 MPL U mL(-1) for assay B and 13.2 MPL U mL(-1) for assay C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These values were not significantly different from the current cut-off values for each assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of low positive results in Group 1 relative to the re-defined cut-off for that group were: 1.0%, 1.1% and 0.9% in assay A, B and C; and in Group 2: 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An indeterminate zone (between the 95th and 99th percentile) was then established for the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence in Group 1 was 3.8%, 3.9% and 3.9% for assays A, B and C, respectively, and for Group 2: 4.4% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that the current cut-off point for each of the three assays is correct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest based on this study that the low positive range is re-assigned 'indeterminate' and recommend that samples falling in this category should be retested to confirm positivity at a later date </plain></SENT>
