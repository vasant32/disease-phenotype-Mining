<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: We present the case of a 47-year-old woman with PAPS presenting with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: Vascular leakage was an incidental finding on fundoscopy in a myopic Chinese woman, and initially this was diagnosed as diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, signs of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vaso-occlusion developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopaenia</z:e> and positive tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were consistent with the diagnosis of PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prevented further thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The possibility of PAPS should be considered in patients presenting with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> without obvious vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
