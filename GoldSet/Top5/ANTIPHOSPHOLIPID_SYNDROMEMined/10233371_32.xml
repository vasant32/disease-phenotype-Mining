<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of these five aCL, as well as two previously published IgG aCL, revealed three patterns of reactivity: (1) four antibodies reacted strongly with human beta2GP1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) complexes and weakly with human beta2GP1 alone; (2) two antibodies recognized bovine beta2GP1, but not human beta2GP1; (3) one antibody reacted with complexes of human beta2GP1 and CL, but not with human beta2GP1 alone </plain></SENT>
