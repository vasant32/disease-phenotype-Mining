<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TORCH is an acronym for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Toxoplasmosis</z:e>, Others (HBV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Varicella-Zoster</z:e> virus, Epstein Barr virus, Coxsackie virus and Parvovirus), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035920" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rubella</z:e>, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herpes Simplex</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 54 pregnancies in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were assessed in comparison with data from 222 healthy pregnant women as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each woman in both groups was systematically screened for TORCH IgG and IgM during pre-conceptional evaluation and/or at the beginning of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assessment of IgG avidity was also evaluated in order to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary infection</z:e> or false positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant increase of CMV IgM false positivity in APS in comparison with controls was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A worse pregnancy outcome was observed among APS patients having CMV IgM false positivity in comparison with APS patients without false positivity; in particular a statistically significant lower neonatal birth weight and a lower neonatal birth weight percentile were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the presence of CMV IgM false positivity could represent a novel prognostic factor for poor pregnancy outcome in APS patients </plain></SENT>
