<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was carried out to clarify the relationship of IgG phosphatidylserine-dependent anti-prothrombin antibody (aPS/PT), IgG beta 2 glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibody (beta 2-GPI aCL), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, using data from 93 patients who visited our hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We computed the positive rates for each of IgG aPS/PT, beta 2-GPI aCL, and LA in the 93 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and carried out logistic regression analysis with IgG aPS/PT as the outcome variable and with beta 2-GPI aCL, LA, and each risk factor as predictor variables in order to assess the relationship of IgG aPS/PT with each factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG aPS/PT was more highly correlated with LA than beta 2-GPI aCL in IgG aPS/PT-positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG aPS/PT itself appears to have high specificity as a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), because there were patients who were IgG aPS/PT-positive but both beta 2-GPI aCL- and LA-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In IgG aPS/PT-positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, IgG aPS/PT is more highly correlated with LA than beta 2-GPI aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also strongly associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurement of IgG aPS/PT in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> could be of diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
