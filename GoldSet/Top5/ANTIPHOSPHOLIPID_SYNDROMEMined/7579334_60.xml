<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> who have venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) in unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited evidence suggests that there is an association between the presence of APLA and both initial and recurrent episodes of VTE and that patients with APLA and VTE are resistant to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unselected patients with a first episode of clinically suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> were evaluated with objective tests for VTE and with laboratory tests for APLA; the latter included tests for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with VTE were treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy and observed during and after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for symptomatic recurrence of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a strong association between LA and VTE (odds ratio, 9.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 46.2) and 9 to 65 (14%; 95% CI, 7% to 25%) patients with VTE had LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of ACLA and VTE (odds ratio, 0.7; 95%CI, 0.3 to 1.7) because of the high frequency of positive ACLA assays in patients without VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 16 patients with VTE and APLA developed recurrent VTE while receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in rates of recurrent VTE in patients with or without APLA after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strong association between LA and VTE suggests that testing for LA in patients with VTE is useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The measurement of ACLA in patients with VTE has no clinical usefulness because the results are abnormal in a high proportion of patients without VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of APLA in patients with VTE was not associated with resistance to a conventional intensity of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or an increased risk of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, a larger study should address these issues in a subgroup of patients with VTE and LA </plain></SENT>
