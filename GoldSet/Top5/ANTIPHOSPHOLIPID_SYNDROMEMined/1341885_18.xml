<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to better characterize valve disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and to determine its association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Estimates of the prevalence of valve disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> have been higher in autopsy series than in clinical studies using transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have been suggested to be a primary pathogenetic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed on 1) 54 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e>, 22 of them with (group I) and 32 without (group II) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>; 2) on 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (group III); and 3) on 35 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in groups I and III had similar types and concentrations of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leaflet thickening was found in 50% of group I, 47% of group II, 10% of group III and 9% of group IV patients (group I or II vs. group III or IV, p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leaflet thickening in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> was diffuse; it usually involved the mitral and aortic valves and was associated with valve regurgitation (73%) or valve masses (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Valve masses were observed in 41% of group I, 25% of group II, 10% of group III and in none of group IV patients (group I or II vs. group IV, p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most valve masses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> were located near the base on the atrial side of the mitral valve or on the vessel side of the aortic valve, had variable size (0.2 to 0.85 cm2), shape and echodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valve regurgitation was observed in 64% of group I, 59% of group II, 10% of group III and 20% of group IV patients (group I or II vs. group III or IV, p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderate or severe regurgitant lesions were noted in 27% of group I and 25% of group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus erythematosus</z:e> valve disease is frequent (74%) regardless of the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> may not be a primary pathogenetic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The characteristic appearance of leaflet thickening and masses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> may be unique </plain></SENT>
