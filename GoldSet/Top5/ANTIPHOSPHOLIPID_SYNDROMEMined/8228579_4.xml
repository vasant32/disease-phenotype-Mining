<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A population of 58 patients susceptible of having LA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLA), was screened for reactivity to HexII PE using the new clotting assay and for the presence of anti-PE antibodies (aPEA) using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients could be classified as follows: 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 14 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e> and 18 miscellaneous non <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HexII PE reactivity was detected in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was significantly more often associated with LA-positivity (20/29) than with LA-negativity (2/29), (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 9 patients with LA had negative HexII PE assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-PE antibodies were detected by ELISA in only 12% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between the distribution of aPEA and that of HexII PE reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 2 LA- and aPLA-negative patients exhibited HexII PE reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of identity between the distribution of HexII PE reactivity and that of either LA or aPEA indicates that this new assay has its own specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It might detect antibodies to the immunogenic hexagonal PE and may therefore have a broader scope than that proposed initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although in the studied populations, no significant relationship could be found between HexII PE positivity and clinical complications (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or recurrent fetal losses), it might be associated with other complications of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
