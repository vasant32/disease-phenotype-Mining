<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was 32-year-old Japanese female who was admitted to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the right upper extremity in September 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations revealed slight <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and hypesthesia of the right arm and leg, impairment of vibration sense below the right knee, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations disclosed raised anticardiolipine antibody level of the IgG class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the cervical spine revealed changes in the spinal cord at C3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A gradual enlargement of the cord at C3-5 level was revealed on T1-weighted sagittal images; increased signal intensity at these same levels was visualized on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following administration of contrast material, an area of increased signal intensity was visualized within the cord extending from the C3/4 level to the C4/5 level in sagittal views and was located in the right lateral and posterior funiculus of the cord in axial views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the admission, the patient's neurological symptoms worsened, and then we treated her by steroid pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After that, the patient's symptoms gradually disappeared and the abnormal signal intensity of the spinal cord on an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No evidence of recurrence was yielded by neurological examinations or neuroimaging studies </plain></SENT>
