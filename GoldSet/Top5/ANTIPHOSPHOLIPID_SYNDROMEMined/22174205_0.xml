<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver enzymes</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and whether further investigations were done, and the differences in SLE-related and/or metabolic factors in patients with and without liver biochemical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients from the University of Toronto <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Clinic who met at least 4 of the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE and had 1.5 times the upper limit for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> transaminase or alanine transaminase on 2 consecutive visits within a 2-year period were matched with controls for age, sex, and SLE duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted at the time of the first appearance of liver enzyme abnormality for the cases and at the reference point for the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 1533 patients reviewed, 134 (8.7%) met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty of these patients were evaluated by a hepatologist, 75 had imaging studies (41 were done specifically for liver investigation), and 13 had liver biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results based on these investigations showed 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty livers</z:hpo>, 35 cases of drug-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, 10 autoimmune etiologies, and 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, cases were higher in body mass index, anti-dsDNA antibody, prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and use of immunosuppressive medication, especially <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>; they were lower in IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>Metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and hepatotoxic effects of medication used to treat SLE may contribute more than SLE-related factors to liver biochemical abnormalities in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
