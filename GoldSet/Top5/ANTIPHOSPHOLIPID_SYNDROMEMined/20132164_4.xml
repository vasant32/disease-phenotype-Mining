<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL target the placenta by binding to beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2) GPI) expressed by the trophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate if and how aPL affect first trimester trophoblast migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: First trimester trophoblast cells were treated with anti-beta(2) GPI monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Migration was determined using a two-chamber assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-6 production was evaluated by RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation was assessed by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Trophoblast cells constitutively secreted IL-6 in a time-dependent manner and this directly correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of anti-beta(2) GPI Abs, trophoblast IL-6 mRNA levels and secretion was downregulated in a Toll-like receptor 4/MyD88-independent manner and this correlated with a reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the anti-beta(2) GPI Abs reduced the migratory potential of trophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was able to reverse aPL-dependent inhibition of trophoblast IL-6 secretion and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that aPL limit trophoblast cell migration by downregulating trophoblast IL-6 secretion and STAT3 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was unable to prevent these effects, our findings may explain why women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, remain at risk of developing obstetrical syndromes, associated with impaired deep placentation, such as pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
