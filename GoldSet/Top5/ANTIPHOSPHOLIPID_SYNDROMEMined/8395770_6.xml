<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was passively induced in ICR mice by injecting them with anticardiolipin antibodies on the first day of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these mice were treated with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in two different doses, with regular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and with a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On gestational day 17 the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the pregnancy outcome was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed by means of a one-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> resulted in a resorption rate of 22.4% as opposed to 41.4% in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> that were given regular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and 51.7% in nontreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> can prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
