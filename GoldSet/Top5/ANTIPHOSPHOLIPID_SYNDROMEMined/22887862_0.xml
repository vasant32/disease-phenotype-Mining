<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of autoantibodies against immunoregulatory effectors can be relevant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and/or the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging insights into an immunological activity profile including a role as opsonins give reason to systematically monitor sera of patients for immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, preferably for several galectins at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on a study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE; pilot cohort p, n = 40; confirmation cohort c, n = 109), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA; p, n = 32; c, n = 25) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS; c, n = 64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based series using galectin-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -8 and -9 and natural processing products, i.e. the truncated version of galectin-3 and the N-terminal domains of galectin-4, -8 and -9, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> healthy donors (p, n = 20; c, n = 21) and patients with paraproteins (c, n = 19) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highly significant optical density-value readings for IgG autoantibodies were consistently detected for the proto-type galectin-7 (SLE) and the tandem repeat-type galectin-8 and -9 (SLE and RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their presence was independent from the autoantibody status against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> (for patients with SLE) or a rheumatoid factor (for patients with RA), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, anti-galectin-2 autoantibodies highly significantly correlated with the appearance of a secondary APS in patients with SLE so that this parameter may serve as an additional biomarker for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Equally of note, the presence of IgG autoantibodies against galectins capable to act as an opsonin may contribute to a sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
