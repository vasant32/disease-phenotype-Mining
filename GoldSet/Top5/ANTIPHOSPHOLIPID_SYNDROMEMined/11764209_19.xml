<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some reports have shown that testing for IgA anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) provides extra diagnostic help in patients with APS, while other authors could not support this data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed this cross sectional study to determine the prevalence of IgA aCL, anti-beta2-GPI, and antiprothrombin antibodies and to study their clinical significance in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised 134 SLE patients (126 women; median age 37.5 yrs, range 16-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the disease was 9 years, range 0.1-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 55 (41%) had a history of thrombotic events: 22 (40%) presented an arterial event, 22 (40%) a venous event, and 11 (20%) both arterial and venous events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 49 women who had been pregnant, 18 (37%) gave a history of recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was present in 14/127 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (30%) were diagnosed as APS secondary to SLE, 23 (17%) had IgG/M aCL and/or LAC without clinical features of APS, and 71 (53%) were SLE patients who were repeatedly negative for IgG/M aCL or LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IgG, IgM, IgA aCL and anti-beta2-GPI were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antibodies directed to prothrombin were detected by 2 ELISA using prothrombin coated on irradiated plates (aPT) and phosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex (aPS/PT) as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgA aCL were found in 18/134 (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3 (17%) had IgA aCL as well as IgG/M aCL, and 2 (11%) had IgG/M aCL and anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 18 patients positive for IgA aCL, 8 were also positive for LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of these, one (5%) patient had IgA aCL as well as other isotype of aCL, and 7 (39%) patients had both aCL and anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had binding of IgA aPT or aPS/PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Of the entire group of 18 patients, 5 (28%) had IgA aCL as the sole aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Four of 5 of these patients were diagnosed as SLE but had no antiphospholipid (aPL) related clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We found no association between the presence of IgA aCL and clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-beta2-GPI were found in 8/134 (6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Of these, one (12.5%) had IgA anti-beta2-GPI as well as IgG/M anti-beta2-GPI and aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients positive for IgA anti-beta2-GPI, 6 (75%) were also positive for LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Of these, one (12.5%) patient presented with IgA anti-beta2-GPI along with other isotypes of aCL, and 4 (50%) patients with aCL and other isotype of anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>One patient (12.5%) had IgA anti-beta2-GPI along with LAC only, and one patient (12.5%) who was diagnosed as SLE had no aPL related clinical manifestation but had IgA anti-beta2-GPI as the sole aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IgA aCL and anti-beta2-GPI are found in SLE, usually along with IgG and/or IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Testing for IgA aCL and anti-beta2-GPI is not a helpful screening test and does not contribute to the recognition of APS in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>IgA aPT and aPS/PT are not present in patients with SLE, therefore there is no need to test for these antibodies </plain></SENT>
