<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 230 patients (218 women, mean age 42.7 ± 11.9 years, mean disease duration 12.2 ± 8.7 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilling the 1982 criteria for SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), anti-β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-β2GPI), solid phase anti-prothrombin (aPT), anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (aPE) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy for each combination of tests was assessed by ROC and their area under the curve analysis as well as by the Youden's index (YI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Testing for six aPL derived 23 possible combinations of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, LA + anti-β(2)GPI + aPS/PT had the best diagnostic accuracy for APS as a whole and individually for both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy loss (AUC 0.712, OR 3.73 [95% CI 1.82-5.38], P = 0.0001, YI = 0.32 and AUC 0.709, OR 3.75 [95% CI 2.13-6.62], P = 0.0001, YI = 0.37 and AUC 0.677, OR 4.82 [95% CI 2.17-10.72], P = 0.0007, YI = 0.38, respectively) and the best specificity when compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other obtainable combination of tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple positivity for LA + anti-β(2)GPI + aPS/PT was more strongly associated with clinical events (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or PL) when compared with double or single positivity (OR 23.2 [95% CI 2.57-46.2] vs. OR 7.3 [95% CI 2.21-25.97], OR 5.7 [95% CI 2.12-17.01] or OR 3.11 [95% CI 1.56-7.8] for single positivity for LA, aPS/PT and anti-β(2)GPI, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combining LA, anti-β(2)GPI and aPS/PT improves the diagnostic power and helps in stratifying the risk for each patient, according to their aPL profile </plain></SENT>
