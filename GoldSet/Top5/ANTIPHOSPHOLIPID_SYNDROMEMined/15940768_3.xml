<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical significance of factor XIII (FXIII) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study including patients with primary APS (n =29), persistent carriers of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) with no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 14), thrombotic patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (n =24), healthy controls (n =28), and patients with mitral and aortic valve prosthesis (n =32, as controls for FXIII only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FXIII and fibrinogen were measured by functional assays: IgG anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), IgG anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) by immunoassay; and paraoxonase activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16836">paranitrophenol</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of carotid arteries was determined by high resolution sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FXIII activity (FXIIIa) was highest in primary APS (p= 0.001), particularly in patients with multiple occlusions (n =12) versus those with single occlusion (158 +/- 45% vs 118 +/- 38%; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In primary APS, FXIII positively correlated with PAI (p=0.003) and fibrinogen (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly in the thrombotic control group, FXIIIa correlated with PAI (p =0.05) and fibrinogen (0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In primary APS, FXIIIa was related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid artery segments (p always &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In thrombotic controls FXIIIa correlated only to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the common carotid (p =0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In primary APS, FXIIIa was strongly associated with IgG aCL and IgG anti-beta2-GPI (p=0.005 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These associations were weaker in the aPL group (FXIIIa with IgG aCL, p= 0.02, with IgG anti-beta2-GPI, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enhanced FXIII activity may contribute to atherothrombosis in primary APS via increased fibrin/fibrinogen cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This pathway is not exclusive to primary APS, being present also in thrombotic controls, but the presence of IgG aPL may favor a higher degree of FXIIIa activation in the primary APS group </plain></SENT>
