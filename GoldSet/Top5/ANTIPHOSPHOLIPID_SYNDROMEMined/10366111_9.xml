<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Exons 7 and 8 of beta2GPI, which encode for its fifth domain, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the presence of mutations was determined by restriction digestion and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical correlation with these mutations and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), anti-beta2GPI antibody, and the development of thromboembolic complications was performed using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From a total of 143 patients studied, we found that 5.6% were heterozygous for the mutation at exon 7 (codon 306), and 7.7% were heterozygous for the mutation at exon 8 (codon 316) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No homozygous subjects were found for either mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between these mutations and the presence of aPL, LAC, or anti-beta2GPI antibodies was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with SLE (n = 95), 4 of 6 patients with exon 8 mutation had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, compared with 22 of 82 patients without the mutation (P = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mutations in the fifth domain of beta2GPI in these patients with SLE and/or APS were similar to those previously reported for the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterozygosity for either mutation does not influence the incidence of aPL, but in patients with SLE, the mutation at exon 8 may predispose to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as an independent factor </plain></SENT>
