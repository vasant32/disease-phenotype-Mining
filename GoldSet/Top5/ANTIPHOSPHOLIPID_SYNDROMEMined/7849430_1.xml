<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> other LE-associated symptoms are not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical course and therapy of three patients with this rarely reported disease, discussing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three young patients (28, 29 and 31 years) were seen at the university eye clinic, presenting severe occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with vitreal haemorrhages and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient did not respond to any therapy (various immunosuppressives, plasma-pheresis, laser coagulation) and ended up with defective light perception in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient also had light perception as final outcome in spite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, steroids and immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient established complete reperfusion on an arteriovenous occlusion after haemodilution and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> interfere with the blood clotting system in many ways (activation and aggregation of thrombocytes, endothelial function, coagulation cascade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimal therapy of this severe disease is unclear, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> seems to be important, while the effect of immunosuppression or steroids is uncertain </plain></SENT>
