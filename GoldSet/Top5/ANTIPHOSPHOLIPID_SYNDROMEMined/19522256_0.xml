<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this symposium, laboratory tests for platelet abnormality were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tests for platelet aggregation were reported to be important for the diagnosis of platelet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> is classified according to the degree of fibrinolysis, it was stated that the measurement of hemostatic molecular markers was further required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> is caused by abnormality of ADAMTS13, verotoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, etc </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> and HIT is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APS is one of the most important diseases which cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or abortion, suggesting that a differential diagnosis of APS is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was reported that diagnostic criteria of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> have been established using a new antibody assay for platelets, immature platelet fractions, thrombopoietin, etc </plain></SENT>
