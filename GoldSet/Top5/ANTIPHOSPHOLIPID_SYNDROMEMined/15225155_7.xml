<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> is also recognized by a cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> generated following the interaction of APOH with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (PL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in the general U.S. white population is about 10%, but it ranges from 30-70% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the structural characterization of APOH from different mammalian species is important to identify the evolutionary conserved regions that may be critical for its function, we have previously determined the chimpanzee APOH gene structure and the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are only two amino acid differences between the chimpanzee and human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> APOH proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chimpanzees have an unusually high prevalence (64%) of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a common protein polymorphism in the human APOH gene, with the occurrence of four alleles APOH*1, APOH*2, APOH*3 and APOH*4, the latter being present only in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on its differential reactivity with an APOH monoclonal antibody, the APOH*3 allele is further divided into APOH*3(W) (present only in whites) and APOH*3(B) (present only in blacks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study we have screened a large African population (n = 755) to determine the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and the molecular basis of the protein polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost 50% of the Africans were found to be positive for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The APOH*3(B) allele was found to be identical to the chimpanzee's <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> APOH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel two-site or three-site haplotypes, encoded in the third domain of APOH, explained the molecular basis of the APOH*3(B), APOH*3(W) and APOH*4 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the comparison of the human and chimpanzee APOH DNA sequences, we suggest that the APOH*3(W) and APOH*4 alleles arose on the ancestral APOH*3(B) haplotype after the split of human races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also found that these haplotypes are associated with the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recombinant APOH haplotypes, expressed in COS-1 cells, showed that these mutations also affect the binding of APOH to anionic PL </plain></SENT>
