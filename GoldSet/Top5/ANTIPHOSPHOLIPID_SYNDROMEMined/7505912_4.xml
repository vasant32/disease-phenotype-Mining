<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether unexplained elevations of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was used to compare pregnancy outcomes between women with second-trimester MSAFP values equal to or greater than 2.5 multiples of the median (MoM) and less than 2.5 MoM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cohort included 60 pregnancies in 47 women with medium to high positive levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen pregnancies (22%) had elevated MSAFP values (median 3.6 MoM, range 2.5-12.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, amniotic fluid AFP was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in seven and elevated in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the elevated MSAFP levels were explained by fetal anomalies, current fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, multiple gestation, incorrect dates, or vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies with elevated MSAFP values had a significantly higher incidence of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (eight of 13, 62%, versus three of 47, 6%) and perinatal loss (ten of 13, 77%, versus seven of 47, 15%) than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSAFP (P &lt; .001, Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these women, the sensitivity and specificity of an unexplained elevated MSAFP level in ascertaining fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were 73 and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For perinatal loss, the sensitivity was 59% and the specificity was 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the placentas studied, infarction occurred in eight of nine (89%) among the women with elevated MSAFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained second-trimester elevations of MSAFP are common in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and are significantly associated with fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in the fetoplacental barrier are implicated as part of the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-mediated pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
