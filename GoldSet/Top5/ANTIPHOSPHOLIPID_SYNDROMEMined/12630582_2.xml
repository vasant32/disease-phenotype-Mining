<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1, 1993, and March 31, 1994, 89 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> were assessed for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and the secondary end points were cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for a mean of 59 months; 1 patient (without aPLs) was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had increased titers of aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were significantly more frequent in the aPL-positive group than in the aPL-negative group (7/19 [37%] vs 8/70 [11%]; P=.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular mortality tended to be higher in the aPL-positive group than in the aPL-negative group (3 [16%] vs 6 [9%]; P = .40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate Cox analysis, presence of aPLs was not an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> and aPLs have an increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
