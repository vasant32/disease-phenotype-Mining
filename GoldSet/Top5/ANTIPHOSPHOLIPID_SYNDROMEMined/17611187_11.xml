<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> can significantly reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in women with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports suggest that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> may act by mechanisms other than anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> on trophoblast biology in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> has not been extensively investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate trophoblast invasion, using an established cell line and primary extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), following exposure to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and fractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An EVT cell line (SGHPL-4) was used to study invasion in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and varying concentrations of fractionated and unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These experiments were repeated using first trimester primary EVTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both forms of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> significantly reduced HGF-induced invasion in the SGHPL-4 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suppression of invasion appeared to be dose-dependent for fractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In primary EVT cells, fractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> also demonstrated significant suppression of invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> has the potential to reduce trophoblast invasion in cell lines and first trimester EVT cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This article highlights the need for further evaluation of these medications in vitro and in vivo, especially when used in the absence of thrombophilic disorders </plain></SENT>
