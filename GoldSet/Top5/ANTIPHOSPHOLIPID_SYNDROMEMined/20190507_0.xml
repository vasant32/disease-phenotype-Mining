<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical and laboratory findings, we made a tentative diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and immediately initiated the plasma exchange (PE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the PE, she developed panperitonitis due to multiple intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic infarction</z:e> within a week after the admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of arterioles at perforated portion in the resected small and large intestines was histologically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we made a definite diagnosis of catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) based on the presence of antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex antibodies (aPS/PT) throughout the course and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> that was revealed positive on one occasion, and multiple thrombotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease of CAPS appeared to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> because of her clinical history and laboratory findings such as persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that CAPS causes systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at microvessels mostly within a week from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the mortality rate in this disorder is as high as 50%, we successfully treated her in combination with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, anticoagulation, concentrated human IgG, surgical procedures, and hemodialysis in addition to PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of CAPS and immediate start of PE may have contributed to the successful treatment </plain></SENT>
