<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated clot lysis time, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen (TAFI) levels and TAFI gene polymorphisms in pregnant patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e>, with or without associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study groups included 82 pregnant patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> (PE group) and 10 pregnant APS patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e> (APS-PE group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Controls included 76 primary pregnant APS patients (APS group) and 89 healthy pregnant patients (NOR group) with uneventful term pregnancy and delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the APS-PE, APS and NOR groups were sampled during each trimester of pregnancy and at 4-6 months and 12 months after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the PE group were sampled during the third trimester and after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly prolonged clot lysis time after delivery was found in the PE, APS-PE and APS groups compared to the NOR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PE and APS-PE groups had longer clot lysis time than the APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of TAFI were found to be higher after delivery in patients of the PE and APS-PE groups compared to the APS and NOR groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allele distribution of the TAFI gene polymorphisms was similar among the four study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased TAFI antigen levels and impaired fibrinolysis are pathogenetic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, regardless of whether or not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> is associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
