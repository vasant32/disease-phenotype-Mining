<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe clinically and pathologically the valvular lesion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied six patients with PAPS and valvulopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of them died and had autopsy and two had valvular replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 18 heart valves, 16 from autopsy and two, one mitral and one aortic, resected at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Murmurs and echocardiographic findings kept correlation with gross pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were found in one or more valves in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients including two of five aortic, two of five mitral, one of four pulmonary and two of four tricuspid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-existence of new and old lesions was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathologic findings included intravalvular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, vascular proliferation, mild histiocytic/fibroblastic infiltration, laminated and verrucous fibrin deposits, laminated and/or nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and focal calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PAPS valvular lesion consists mainly of superficial or intravalvular fibrin deposits and its subsequent organization: vascular proliferation, fibroblast influx, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This results in valve thickening, fusion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> leading to functional abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> is not a prominent feature of this lesion </plain></SENT>
