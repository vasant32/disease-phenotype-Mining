<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) who develop diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> is an occasionally reported manifestation of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis, however, may be overlooked or manifestations attributed to another disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven episodes in 5 patients with primary APS were identified and retrospectively reviewed for presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The severity of the condition varies, and diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> may be the initial manifestation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients may present with symptoms ranging from cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo>, to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypoxemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> are usually present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other causes need to be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage with or without biopsy often aid in confirming the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathologic abnormality appears to be microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">capillaritis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> usually leads to marked improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with APS may present with diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>alveolar hemorrhage</z:mp> resulting in mild to life threatening symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prompt and thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> usually leads to rapid improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical setting will dictate whether other therapies such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> or intravenous immunoglobulin are required </plain></SENT>
