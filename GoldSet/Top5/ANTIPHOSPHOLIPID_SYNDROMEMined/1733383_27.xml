<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with evaluation of case patients and control patients by Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up for case patients was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University-based tertiary medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients who were diagnosed with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> during a 10-year period; 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ten patients (36%; 95% Cl, 19% to 56%) with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> had cardiac valvular involvement: Four patients had mitral valve involvement; four patients, aortic valve involvement; and two patients, both mitral and aortic valvular involvement; no patients had tricuspid or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034087" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 patients had a regurgitant murmur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the control patients had valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean mitral valve thickness in patients with mitral valve involvement was 7.0 +/- 1.6 mm, compared with 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves and 3.2 +/- 0.9 mm in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean aortic valve thickness in patients with aortic valve involvement was 3.8 +/- 0.5 mm compared with 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> valves and 1.4 +/- 0.5 mm in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stenotic lesions were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regurgitation was severe in two patients (one required surgery), moderate in three patients, and mild in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valvular involvement is frequently found in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The lesions are left-sided, causing regurgitation that may be clinically important </plain></SENT>
