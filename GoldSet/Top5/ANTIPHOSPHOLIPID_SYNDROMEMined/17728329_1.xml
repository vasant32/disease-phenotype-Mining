<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We analysed the genetic polymorphisms in platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (GP) Ib-alpha, Ia/IIa and IIb/IIIa and their correlation with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 131 patients with APS (86 with primary APS and 45 with APS associated with SLE), 102 patients with SLE and 160 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GP Ib-alpha VNTR polymorphism, GP Ia/IIa 807 C/T polymorphism and GP IIb/IIIa PlA1/2 polymorphism were determined by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events were assessed clinically and confirmed by objective methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was evaluated by a carotid ultrasound study in a subgroup of 70 patients with SLE measuring the intima-media wall thickness and the presence of arteriosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 50 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in 36 patients with APS have been registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a significant correlation between the 807 T/T genotype of GP Ia/IIa and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (22% vs 7%, p = 0.04; OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.20 to 10.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The VNTR Ib-alpha and P1A1/2 IIb/IIIa polymorphisms were not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with APS when individually analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of both 807 T and PlA2 alleles increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> risk (28% vs 7%, p = 0.005; OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with SLE, no relationship was found between the presence of carotid arteriosclerotic plaque and separate polymorphisms of platelet GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of alleles 807 T of GP Ia/IIa and PlA2 of GP IIb/IIIa was associated with the presence of carotid plaque (35% vs 4%, p = 0.002; OR 12.92, 95% CI 2.39 to 69.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The T/T genotype of 807 C/T polymorphism of GP Ia/IIa may be an additional risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of both 807 T and PlA2 alleles increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> risk in patients with APS and preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
