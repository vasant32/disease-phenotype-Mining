<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, LA activity sustained by anti-FII antibodies has a much weaker association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than LA activity sustained by anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because assays aimed at detecting LA activity are now commercially available, we evaluated the relative sensitivity to anti-FII and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies of a commercial LA assay in a consecutive series of patients with the clinical suspicion of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and ten consecutive patients with the clinical suspicion of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome (primary in 39) and 36 healthy controls were evaluated for the presence of LA activity (LA, Staclot, Stago), anticardiolipin antibodies (Quanta Lite aCL IgG, IgM, Inova Diagnostics), and IgG binding to solid-phase and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL)-bound beta(2)-GPI and FII by ELISA assays developed an optimized in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for the association of IgG binding activity with LA and the aCL IgG status were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In LA patients, dependency of LA potency (as assessed by clotting time prolongation in absence or presence of hexagonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>) on autoantibody titers was analyzed by the generalized linear model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total IgG fractions were purified from selected patients to evaluate their ability to inhibit prothrombin activation at low FII concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) of the IgG or IgM type were found in 64 and 23 patients and LA activity in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI and anti-FII (solid-phase and PL-bound) IgG titers exceeding by more than 3 standard deviations the mean values observed in control subjects were found in 46 and 47 patients and in 56 and 30 patients respectively, with the highest titers detected in the subgroup of patients with both LA and aCL IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of LA for patients free of anti-FII and/or anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG was 0.03 after stratification for the aCL IgG status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI (solid-phase and PL-bound) IgG (RR 34.4 and 12.6) and anti-FII (solid-phase) IgG (RR 6.33) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, when taking into account co-existence of anti-FII and anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG in the same patients, the relative risk of LA for patients with isolated anti-FII IgG (solid-phase and/or PL-bound) was 0.50, whereas it ranged from 4.24 to 8.70 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the antibody combinations including anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)-GPI (PL-bound) and aCL IgG titers were the only significant predictors of LA potency determined in absence <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG) or in presence of hexagonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (aCL IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total IgG fractions purified from 12 patients (6 with anti-FII IgG) did not significantly inhibit factor II activity up to a 150-fold molar excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the high prevalence of anti-FII and anti-beta(2)-GPI IgG in patients with the clinical suspicion of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome and particularly in the subgroup of patients with LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The fraction of LA activity which can be quenched by addition of hexagonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> is, however, only dependent on IgG directed to PL-bound beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Other antibodies associated with anticardiolipin IgG may explain residual clotting time prolongation observed in the presence of hexagonal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
