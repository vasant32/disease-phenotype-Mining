<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) frequently detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) have been associated with vascular occlusive diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore we measured the s-TM in 60 patients with SLE, in 23 patients with other diseases including aPL (disease control group) and in 26 healthy subjects, by means of an enzyme immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies to human TM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation was found between s-TM and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels in SLE patients (r = 0.813, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the s-TM level was divided by the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level (TM/Cr) to exclude the effect of renal clearance, the TM/Cr ratios were significantly increased in SLE patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) compared to those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratios did not correlate with the presence of aPL or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLS) in SLE patients or in the disease control group, although a weak correlation between the TM/Cr ratios and IgG-anticardiolipin antibody titers was found in the SLE patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (r = 0.449, p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that elevated TM/Cr ratios reflect renal and possibly extra-renal endothelial cell damage in SLE patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>, but that s-TM levels do not associate with the presence of aPL or a history of APLS </plain></SENT>
