<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Science 2005; 308:1906-1908], difficulties in eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV were linked to the binding of prototypic broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to autoantigens and in particular, to the binding of two antigp41 antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, to the autoantigen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a number of assays to understand whether 2F5 and 4E10 are autoreactive, polyreactive, or have a generalized affinity for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> that may facilitate recognition of their membrane proximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2F5 and 4E10 were evaluated for autoreactivity using diagnostic assays developed to detect serum antibodies associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As an indication of polyreactivity, we measured the binding of 2F5 and 4E10 to liposomal bilayers of differing composition using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and to protein microarrays using biochip technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2F5 showed completely negative results in the APS and SPR studies, indicating that it is neither autoreactive nor absolutely requires <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 4E10 bound to more than one <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and showed weak activity in the APS studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The activity displayed by 4E10 more closely resembles that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> elicited during many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> than that of autoimmune APS antibodies, at variance with the notion that difficulites in eliciting 4E10-like antibodies can be attributed to tolerance mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microarray studies further indicated that broadly neutralizing anti-HIV mAb are not exceptionally polyreactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that autoantigen mimicry cannot be reliably invoked as a general mechanism for HIV immune evasion </plain></SENT>
