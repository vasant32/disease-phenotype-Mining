<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of these syndromes is unknown, but may involve antibody-mediated alterations in endothelial cell coagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this possibility, we determined the incidence of endothelial cell-reactive antibodies in 76 patients whose plasma contained anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, but who had no clinically-evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma from 47 patients deposited significantly more immunoglobulin on cultured endothelial cells than control plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive tests were more frequent in patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in those without (17/19 v 23/48; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we observed no correlation between immunoglobulin deposition on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and endothelial cells by individual plasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, endothelial cell reactivity was not diminished by adsorption of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies from patient sera using liposomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin fractions prepared from 5/6 patient sera immunoprecipitated a approximately 70 kDa endothelial cell surface protein; 4/5 of these fractions also induced the release of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor from endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that plasma from many patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, but no clinically-evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, also contains endothelial cell-reactive antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detection of such antibodies might help identify individuals in this patient population at greatest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
