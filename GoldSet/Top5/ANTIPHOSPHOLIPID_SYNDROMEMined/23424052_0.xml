<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These have included variability in the sensitivity of assays and reagents; high false-negative and false-positive detection rates; a lack of consensus for the use of mixing tests; and, to some extent, lack of compliance with guidelines published by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibody</z:hpo> Scientific Standardization Committee of the International Society on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and Haemostasis (ISTH) </plain></SENT>
