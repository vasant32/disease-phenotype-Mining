<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose a logical pathway of how experimental APS (eAPS) causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e>: binding of the antibodies to the brain endothelium evoking microthrombosis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, and IgG leakage through the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), then secondary inflammatory cell spread around blood vessels and production of cytokines by these inflammatory cells leading to further disruption of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diffuse brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> would result in extravasation of serum proteins including APS IgG and activated thrombin, which may induce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> observed in the APS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have collected data from the mouse eAPS model which supports this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the mechanism of the pathogenicity of aPL in vitro and in vivo will serve as a much needed basis for developing new therapeutic modalities in this important disorder </plain></SENT>
