<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) has been often associated to RPL since 1980 and some reports in the Literature rarely described antibodies to factor XII in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE HISTORY: We report the case history of 34-year-old caucasian women with recurrent fetal loss and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemostatic tests revealed persistent light decrease of clotting factor XII with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and transient positivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Few reports in the Literature described antibodies to factor XII in patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and transient LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So, once other causes of RPL were excluded, the patient was diagnosed an unusual form of APS associated to antibodies to factor XII, reduced factor XII plasma levels, transient LA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: We suggest to consider also antibodies directed to clotting factors (e.g. factor XII in our case) as second step of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening in RPL, in particular if a persistent prolonged aPTT is present without an apparent cause </plain></SENT>
