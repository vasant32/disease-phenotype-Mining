<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter randomized trial included 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Generalizability of results from randomized patients was evaluated by means of additional data from 13 women refusing and 12 women ineligible for randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from study groups were compared with Fisher's exact test, and generalizability was evaluated with a chi 2 test for trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Live birth rates were the same (75%) with either treatment, but "serious" maternal morbidity and the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> were significantly higher among women randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (p = 0.02 vs p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results could be generalized to the other groups of women ascertained during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> should be preferred to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> when treatment is indicated for high-risk pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
