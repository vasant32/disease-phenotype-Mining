<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to clarify whether or not anti-Anx V is also adsorbed by DS-bound cellulose beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from anti-Anx V-positive patients were mixed with DS-bound cellulose beads in vitro, and the titers of anti-Anx V were measured both before and after incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anti-Anx V titers significantly decreased after incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Anx V also bound to bovine serum albumin-conjugated DS immobilized on microtiter plates </plain></SENT>
