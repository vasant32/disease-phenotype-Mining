<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have shown that the ubiquitin editing enzyme A20 (Tnfaip3) determines the activation threshold of DCs, via control of canonical NF-κB activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tnfaip3(fl/fl)Cd11c-cre(+) mice lacking A20 in DCs demonstrated spontaneous proliferation of conventional and double-negative T cells, their conversion to interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing effector cells, and expansion of plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They developed ds-DNA antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and lymphosplenomegaly-features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A20-deficient DCs were resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, caused by increased sensitivity to CD40L and RANKL prosurvival signals and upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They captured injected apoptotic cells more efficiently, resisted the inhibitory effects of apoptotic cells, and induced self-reactive effector lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because genetic polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 are associated with human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, these findings identify A20-mediated control of DC activation as a crucial checkpoint in the development of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
