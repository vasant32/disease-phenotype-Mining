<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We compared the use of aspirin alone with combined therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus aspirin) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-positive obstetric patients with prior adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine patients meeting specific laboratory and clinical inclusion criteria were randomized to receive either combined therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin, n = 17) or aspirin alone (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The daily aspirin dose was 81 mg; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was begun at 20 mg/day and increased or decreased on the basis of observed changes in serial antibody levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perinatal outcomes were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of treatment-related maternal complications and serial antibody titers was also accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized subjects were evaluable (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin, n = 12 vs aspirin only, n = 22); no perinatal losses were observed in the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>Preterm delivery</z:hpo> was experienced by significantly more patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin than aspirin only (8/12 vs 3/22, respectively; p = 0.003), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> exposure appeared to be an independent risk factor for preterm birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy in conjunction with low-dose aspirin does not appear to improve outcome and may provoke obstetric complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-positive patients </plain></SENT>
