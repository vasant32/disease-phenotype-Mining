<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that C5a induction of tissue factor (TF) expression in neutrophils contributes to respiratory burst, trophoblast injury, and pregnancy loss in mice treated with aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed how TF contributes to neutrophil activation and trophoblast injury in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils from aPL-treated mice expressed protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), and stimulation of this receptor led to neutrophil activation, trophoblast injury, and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An antibody specific for human TF that has little impact on coagulation, but potently inhibits TF/Factor VIIa (FVIIa) signaling through PAR2, inhibited aPL-induced neutrophil activation in mice that expressed human TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic deletion of the TF cytoplasmic domain, which allows interaction between TF and PAR2, reduced aPL-induced neutrophil activation in aPL-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Par2-/- mice treated with aPL exhibited reduced neutrophil activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies, which indicates that PAR2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aPL-induced fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and pravastatin decreased TF and PAR2 expression on neutrophils and prevented pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that TF/FVIIa/PAR2 signaling mediates neutrophil activation and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in APS and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may be a good treatment for women with aPL-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
