<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta2-GP1) antibodies are a better marker of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Evaluation and testing of sera from women with RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A university-affiliated reproductive endocrinology practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(s): 90 women with RPL; 45 women met criteria for APS and 45 women met criteria for RPL without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were of similar age and had a similar history of RPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(s): Patient sera were obtained from women with RPL and were tested for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and beta2-GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(s): A standard <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> assay was employed to detect the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA antibodies in serum against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> serine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Samples were also assayed with a commercial beta2-GP1 assay for IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULT(s): Among the 45 women with APS, 10 (22.2%) had positive IgG antibodies for beta2-GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 woman (2.2%) of 45 was positive for beta2-GP1 among the control group of women with RPL but negative <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation noted among the beta2-GP1-positive patients for a specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody or isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(s): These data suggest that IgG beta2-GP1 antibodies are less sensitive than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> for the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
