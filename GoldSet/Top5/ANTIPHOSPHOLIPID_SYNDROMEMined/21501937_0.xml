<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and thin-section CT findings of 17 consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of SLE with APS, comparing with 37 consecutive SLE patients without APS, between 2004 and 2008, and patients who had other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren</z:e> syndrome, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen between the two groups in age, gender, smoking habits, or history of steroid pulse and biological therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT images of 2mm thickness obtained with a 16- or 64-detector row CT were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus on ultra high-resolution gray-scale monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of thin-section CT abnormalities was higher in SLE with APS group (82%) than in SLE without APS group (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ground-glass opacity (59%), architectural distortion (47%), reticulation (41%), enlarged peripheral pulmonary artery (29%), and mosaic attenuation (29%) were significantly more common in the SLE with APS group than in the SLE without APS group (Fisher's exact test, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SLE patients with APS have increased prevalence of thin-section chest CT abnormalities than those without APS </plain></SENT>
