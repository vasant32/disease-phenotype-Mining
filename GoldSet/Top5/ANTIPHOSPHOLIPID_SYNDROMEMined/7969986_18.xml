<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were three PET studies: (1) during an episode of right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemichorea</z:e>, (2) during an asymptomatic period 6 months later, and (3) during an episode of left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemichorea</z:e> occurring 2 months after that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each study, we calculated normalized regional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism for the caudate and lentiform nuclei and compared these values with those calculated in 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer subjects (mean age, 35.3 +/- 9.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following results were obtained: (1) during right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemichorea</z:e>, left lentiform metabolism was increased by 19% (&gt; 3 SD); (2) during the asymptomatic period, right caudate metabolism was increased by 20% (&gt; 3 SD), and right lentiform and left striatal metabolism were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; and (3) during left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemichorea</z:e>, right caudate and lentiform metabolism were both elevated by 33% (&gt; 3 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this episode, left caudate metabolism was elevated by 20% (&gt; 2 SD); left lentiform metabolism was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemichorea</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> may be associated with contralateral striatal hypermetabolism that may also be present during asymptomatic periods </plain></SENT>
