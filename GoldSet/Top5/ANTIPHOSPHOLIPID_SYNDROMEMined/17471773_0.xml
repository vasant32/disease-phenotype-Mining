<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent reviews that evaluated the prognostic value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have concluded that the prognostic significance ofAPS for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> is, at best, unclear and that its presence has no therapeutic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A study that compared high- versus standard-dosage <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in patients with APS found no additional benefit from high-dosage <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A study in patients with a recent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> found no additional benefit from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (standard dosage) versus aspirin in patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, on the basis of the evidence at hand, screening for APS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004416'>premature atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is not considered to be useful </plain></SENT>
