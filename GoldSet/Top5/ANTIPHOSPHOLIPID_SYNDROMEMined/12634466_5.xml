<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reproductive performance of non-pregnant women with recurrent spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> (RSM) and the association between RSM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>) in reproductive failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty non-pregnant women with 3 or more consecutive RSM attending our RSM clinic were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed history and physical examination were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extensive laboratory investigations, ultrasonographic, radiological and specialized procedures/tests were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those patients who did not achieve pregnancy within the first 6 months of follow-up had appropriate treatment options implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome of any subsequent pregnancies was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33.8 +/- 4.6 years (range 22-43 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aetiological factors associated with RSM were chromosome anomaly, uterine abnormality, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>; 40% were 'unexplained' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (60%) were able to achieve viable pregnancies which progressed to term, resulting in live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the other 20 patients had high body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 and evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these 20 patients, 13 eventually achieved pregnancies which ended again in first-second-trimester abortions (cause undetermined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining 7 patients (4 with high BMI) who had a combination of male factor/protracted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian failure</z:e> did not achieve pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The association of RSM with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCOS</z:e> resulted in poor reproductive performance, which may progress to reproductive failure </plain></SENT>
