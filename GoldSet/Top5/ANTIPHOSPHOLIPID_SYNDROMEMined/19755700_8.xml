<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare vascular structure and function in patients with positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) with controls and to assess their relationship with paraoxonase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of 77 women with positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> outpatient clinic in London, England (90% of the eligible population) and 77 controls matched on frequency basis for age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> between June 2006 and April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, pulse wave velocity, and paraoxonase activity were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CIMT, pulse wave velocity, flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, and paraoxonase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with aPL had greater CIMT and pulse wave velocity compared with controls (mean [SD], 0.75 [0.16] vs 0.64 [0.09] mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.14 to -0.06; P &lt; .001; and 9.2 [1.6] vs 8.5 [1.8] m/s; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.06; P = .04) and lower flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (6.2% [4.1%] vs 9.6% [4.2%]; 95% CI, 2.02%-4.69%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paraoxonase activity was lower in women with aPL vs controls (median [interquartile range], 91.2 [64.3-105.1] vs 103.0 [80.5-111.5] micromol p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39362">nitrophenol</z:chebi>/L/serum/min; 95% CI, 0.004-0.007; P = .005) and was inversely associated with CIMT and pulse wave velocity in women with aPL (standardized beta coefficient = -0.4 and -0.3, respectively; P &lt; .05 for both), but not in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> from women with aPL inhibited endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production in human aortic endothelial cells, in contrast with controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, women with aPL had greater functional and structural arterial abnormalities, which were associated with lower activity of paraoxonase </plain></SENT>
