<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) still remains a laboratory challenge due to the great diversity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and their significance regarding APS-diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-line dot assay (MLDA) employing phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), and beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2 GPI) was used to detect aPL, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in 85 APS patients, 65 disease controls, and 79 blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, anti-CL and anti-β2 GPI IgG and IgM were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of agreement of both methods was good for anti-CL IgG, moderate for anti-CL IgM, very good for anti-β2 GPI IgG, and moderate for anti-β2 GPI IgM (kappa = 0.641, 0.507, 0.803 and 0.506, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of observed discrepancies for anti-CL IgG (1.75%), anti-CL IgM (3.93%), anti-β2 GPI IgG (1.75%), and anti-β2 GPI IgM (0.87%) was low (McNemar test, P &lt; 0.05, not-significant, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios for at least one positive aPL antibody assessed by ELISA were 58.8%, 95.8%, 14.1, and 0.4, respectively, and for at least three positive aPl IgM and/or one positive aPL IgG by MLDA were 67.1%, 96.5%, 19.3, and 0.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IgM to PI, PS and CL, and combination of three or more aPL IgM detected by MLDA was significantly higher in APS patients with cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The novel MLDA is a readily available, single-step, sensitive diagnostic tool for the multiplex detection of aPL antibodies in APS and a potential alternative for single aPL antibody testing by ELISA </plain></SENT>
