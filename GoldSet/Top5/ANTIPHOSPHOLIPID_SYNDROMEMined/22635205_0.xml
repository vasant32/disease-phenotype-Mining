<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The founding principle of the APS ACTION is that it is an internationally collaborative effort, open to qualified investigators across the globe who are committed to furthering our understanding of APS and its management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the hard work and collaborative spirit of APS ACTION members, in early 2012, APS ACTION launched two important collaborative international projects: 1) a randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine in the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prevention of persistently aPL-positive but <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free patients without other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>; and 2) a web-based registry of aPL-positive patients with or without systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, which will also include annual blood collection for aPL-testing and future basic science studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the end, we hope to find better treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, which is a leading cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, pregnancy morbidity and other life-altering consequences, and to heighten awareness about this life-threatening, autoimmune condition </plain></SENT>
