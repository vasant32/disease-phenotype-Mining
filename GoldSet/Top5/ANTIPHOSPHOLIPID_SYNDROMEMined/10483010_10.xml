<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if the measurement of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (abeta2-GPI) in serum levels contributes to the better characterization of the clinical situation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose abeta2-GPI of both isotypes was measured in 42 patients with APS and 32 SLE patients without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were thoroughly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of abeta2-GPI was correlated with the clinical manifestations of APS and compared with the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between levels of aCL and abeta2-GPI for both IgG and IgM isotypes (rho of Spearman=0.82 and 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>64 respectively, P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies presented significantly higher titres in LA positive patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity for APS was 91% for IgG abeta2-GPI vs 75% for IgG aCL and 87% for IgM abeta2-GPI vs 81% for IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>68% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of 100% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> showed positive tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three markers (aCL, LA, abeta2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous presence of circulating LA and high titres of both aCL and abeta2-GPI identify a subset of patients with primary APS (PAPS) who have a more severe clinical course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the specificity of abeta2-GPI IgG is higher than that of aCL IgG, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three tests are performed abeta2-GPI testing provides only additional information to that of aCL and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we concluded that the abeta2-GPI test should not be considered as a substitute for conventional LA or aCL assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, performance of abeta2-GPI seems to be important in PAPS with high aCL titres, to alert the physician about the risk for the worst course of the illness </plain></SENT>
