<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested for other indications as well, e.g. for pregnant women at risk of a child with Rhesus-D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemolytic disease</z:e>, or as a vaccine which might reduce the receptiveness for HIV-1 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on our experience on adverse side-effects of intradermal lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) for <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> couples using partner's lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective 4 week follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> couples from 2000 to 2003 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reactions (feedback 2687/3246 [corrected] 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> couples treated between 1996 and 2002 received questionnaires after 2-3 years (feedback 1914/3041, 63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local reactions predominantly consisted of redness and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e> for approximately 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic reactions could be attributed to LIT in 6-8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008066'>Blisters</z:hpo> at the injection sites were characteristic of LIT but not dependent on the HLA class I mismatch status between cell donor and host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> was 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in pregnancy which was not ascribed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> side-effects are comparable to those reported after intradermal vaccination for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific risks for <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, autoimmune or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> were not detected </plain></SENT>
