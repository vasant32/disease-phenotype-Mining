<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no appropriately designed studies have been performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS)-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in patients diagnosed with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six consecutive patients with PAPS (Sapporo criteria) and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled at two referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were secondary causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A complete clinical neurologic exam followed by nerve conduction studies (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>Paresthesias</z:hpo> were reported in eight patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Objective mild distal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and abnormal symmetric deep tendon reflexes were observed in three patients (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to the electrophysiologic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, nine patients (35.0%) had alterations: four (15.5%) had pure sensory or sensorimotor distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> (in two of them a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CTS|CTS1">carpal tunnel syndrome</z:e> was also present) and one (4%) had sensorimotor demyelinating and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> involving upper and lower extremities, while four patients (15.5%) showed isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CTS|CTS1">carpal tunnel syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical and serologic results were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with PAPS, regardless of the presence of electrophysiologic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> is a common asymptomatic abnormality in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The routine performance of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> may be considered when evaluating such patients </plain></SENT>
