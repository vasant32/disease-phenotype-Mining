<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies, when investigated in different assays in vitro, activate endothelial cells and promote uptake of modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that aPL can contribute to atheroma development by targeting some of the sequential steps that constitute early atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If substantiated by large-scale clinical trials, the pro-atherogenic properties of aPL may merit screening and intervention programs in selected populations </plain></SENT>
