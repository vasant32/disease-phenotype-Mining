<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the frequencies of ACLA and related laboratory and clinical features in OCB negative (OCB-) and positive (OCB+) MS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared 41 OCB- patients attending a MS Clinic in a tertiary referral center, with 206 OCB+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ACLA, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and other autoantibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and coagulation markers were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found a higher frequency of ACLA in OCB- patients, 18/41 versus 33/206 in OCB+ patients (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OCB- patients had more progressive MS than OCB+ subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in age, sex, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> symptoms between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACLA+ MS patients were more frequently in the OCB- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this may suggest that they represent a special subgroup of MS, no other clinical or laboratory findings distinguish the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although OCB- MS patients may be thought to be less active immunologically, this study shows they have more frequently ACLA than OCB+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OCB- MS patients in our cohort do not appear to have a more benign form of MS, as has previously been suggested </plain></SENT>
