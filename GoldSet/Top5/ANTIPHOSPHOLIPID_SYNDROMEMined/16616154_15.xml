<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics, follow-up, and fulfillment of classification criteria for other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (SAD) in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren</z:e> syndrome (SS) and atypical autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 402 patients diagnosed with primary SS seen consecutively in our Department since 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We considered anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-topoisomerase1/Scl70, anticentromere (ACA), anti-Jo1, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>), anticardiolipin antibodies (aPL), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> as atypical autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were prospectively followed after inclusion into the protocol, focusing on the development of features that might lead to the fulfillment of classification criteria for additional SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a control group, we selected an age-sex-matched subset of patients with primary SS without atypical autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two (20%) patients showed atypical autoantibodies (36 had aPL, 21 anti-DNA, 13 ANCA, 10 anti-RNP, 8 ACA, 6 anti-Sm, 2 anti-Scl70, and 1 anti-Jo-1 antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 77 (94%) women and 5 (6%) men, with a mean age of 57 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with atypical autoantibodies had no statistical differences in the prevalence of the main sicca features, extraglandular manifestations (except for a higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>, 28% versus 7%, P=0.001), immunological markers, and in the fulfillment of the 2002 classification criteria, compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 534 patient-years, 13 (16%) of the 82 patients with atypical autoantibodies developed an additional SAD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> in 5 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in 4, limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> in 3, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343192" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microscopic polyangiitis</z:e> in 1) compared with none in the control group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an immunological overlap (defined by the presence of autoantibodies considered typical of other SAD) in 20% of our patients with primary SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical significance of these atypical autoantibodies varies widely depending on the autoantibodies detected, with a broad spectrum of prevalence and clinical patterns of disease expression, and a specific predilection for association with some SAD in preference to others </plain></SENT>
