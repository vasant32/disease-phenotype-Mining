<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists as to whether vaccination triggers the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SLE (101) and matched controls (101) were enrolled from 2005-2009 and received seasonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera were tested by ELISA for aCL at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks after vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vaccine responses were ranked according to an overall anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> antibody response index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with positive aCL were further tested for β2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with SLE and healthy controls can develop new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> aCL post vaccination, although at rates which do not differ between patients and controls (12/101 cases and 7/101 controls, OR 1.81, p = 0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>New-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> moderate aCL are slightly enriched in African American SLE patients (5/36 cases; p = 0.094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optical density measurements for aCL reactivity in patients were significantly higher than baseline at 2 weeks (p &lt; 0.05), 6 weeks (p &lt; 0.05), and 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05) post vaccination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No new β2GPI antibodies were detected among patients with new aCL reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Vaccine response was not different between patients with and without new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> aCL reactivity (p = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows transient increases in aCL, but not anti-β2GPI responses, after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination </plain></SENT>
