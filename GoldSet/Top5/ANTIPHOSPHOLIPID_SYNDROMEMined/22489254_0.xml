<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight PAPS patients (Sydney's criteria) were analyzed by a standard interview, physical examination and review of medical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, clinical manifestations, associated comorbidities, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine (10.2%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were identified, 77.8% had <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after PAPS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age, gender, and race were comparable in groups with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a higher frequency of current smoking (44.4 versus 10.1%, P = 0.019) was observed in the first group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis confirmed that smoking (P = 0.030) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.042) were independently associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About 10.2% of PAPS patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, predominantly after PAPS diagnosis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were associated to current smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
