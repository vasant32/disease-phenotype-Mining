<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have already demonstrated (Stojanovic et al., 2009) a connection between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid (TTd) hyperimmunization and the induction of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) in BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that C57BL/6 mice subjected to an identical procedure do not exhibit any like pathology attributable to anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies; we explain that this absence results from idiotypic connectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six groups of C57BL/6 mice were hyperimmunized with TTd in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="16234">hydroxide</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>, with or without pretreatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretreated mice had been injected with polyclonal or nonspecific immune stimulators, such as complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity of induced antibodies was tested by indirect ELISA using a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid immunogen and these autoantigens: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">gangliosides</z:chebi>, laminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Idiotypic connectivity was tested by competitive ELISA and gauged from the degree to which the interaction of idiotypic/anti-idiotypic complementary antibodies was inhibited in the presence of immunized sera antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher idiotypic connectivity was noted amongst pretreated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between higher connectivity and autoantibody levels that acted to favor the participation of natural autoantibodies in the inhibitory process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that idiotypic connectivity plays a protective role in immunization-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
