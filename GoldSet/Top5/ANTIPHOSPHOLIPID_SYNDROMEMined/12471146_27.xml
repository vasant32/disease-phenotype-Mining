<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As determined using domain deletion mutants, human autoantibodies bind to the first of five domains present in beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the fine detail of the domain I <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> has been examined using 10 selected mutants of whole beta(2)GPI containing single point mutations in the first domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The binding to beta(2)GPI was significantly affected by a number of single point mutations in domain I, particularly by mutations in the region of aa 40-43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling predicted these mutations to affect the surface shape and electrostatic charge of a facet of domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation K19E also had an effect, albeit one less severe and involving fewer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in two different laboratories using affinity-purified anti-beta(2)GPI in a competitive inhibition ELISA and with whole serum in a direct binding ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies bind to domain I, and that the charged surface patch defined by residues 40-43 contributes to a dominant target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
