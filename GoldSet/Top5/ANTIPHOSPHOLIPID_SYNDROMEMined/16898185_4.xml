<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anaemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) in APS has not been well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review the occurrence of AIHA in patients with APS and its relation to other disease manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-hundred and eight patients with APS from seven medical centers in Israel, Serbia and the Slovac Republic were included and evaluated for associations between AIHA and various manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIHA was documented in 32 patients (10.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ration for AIHA was increased in the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (5.4 and 7.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a highly significant association between AIHA and cardiac valvular vegetations and thickening (P &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.02 and P &lt; 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, APS patients with AIHA are at risk of developing these manifestations, and should therefore be investigated for them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the occurrence of AIHA may define a subgroup of patients with a significant risk for subsequent development of SLE </plain></SENT>
