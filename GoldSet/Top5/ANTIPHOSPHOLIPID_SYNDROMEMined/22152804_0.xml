<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To observe whether the TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) is activated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells treated with β₂ GPI/anti-β₂ GPI complex and investigate the roles of TRIF-dependent signaling pathway of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted and the protein lysates were collected from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells stimulated with β₂ GPI/anti-β₂ GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And the level of TRIF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells was detected by Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), TRIF protein expression was investigated by western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whether TLR4 inhibitor, TAK-242, could interrupt the expression of TRIF as well as some inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells stimulated with β₂ GPI/anti-β₂ GPI complex was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of TRIF could be significantly increased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells with treatment of β₂ GPI/anti-β₂ GPI complex (100 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of TRIF was shown in a manner of time-dependence, with the maximal levels at 1 hour (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) and 2 hour (protein) stimulation respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The β₂ GPI/anti-β₂ GPI complex-induced TRIF and inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α expression in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells could be inhibited by TAK-242 (5 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TRIF-dependent signaling pathway of Toll-like receptor 4 is involved in the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells induced by β₂ GPI/anti-β₂GPI complex, suggesting that TRIF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
