<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (beta2-GPI) antibodies and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) tests (aPL ELISA and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or LAC) and the associations of each of these aPL tests with individual clinical manifestations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG and IgM anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were determined by ELISA in 281 patients with SLE, primary APS, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies, sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values and correlations of anti-beta2-GPI were compared to the aPL ELISA (IgG and IgM) and LAC for individual (and combined) features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 139 patients with positive aPL ELISA and/or LAC tests, 57 (41%) had anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) compared to 11% of patients with SLE negative for these tests (p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 130 patients with APS, anti-beta2-GPI occurred in 42% and tended to be more specific but less sensitive than the aPL ELISA or LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 aPL tests were combined, the best sensitivities and negative predictive values were achieved; however, specificity and positive predictive values remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies occurred more frequently in primary APS (58%) vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e> (33%) (p = 0.008, OR = 2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 79 patients with SLE negative by both aPL ELISA and LAC, 9 (11 %) were positive for anti-beta2-GPI, 7 of whom had clinical features consistent with APS (representing 5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis revealed beta2-GPI to be most strongly associated with neurological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1558937" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndromes other</z:e> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and recurrent fetal loss, while LAC was most strongly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IgM aPL antibodies also were independently associated with neurological syndromes and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Testing for beta2-GPI antibodies may be clinically useful in the diagnosis of APS but cannot supplant other aPL ELISA or LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses suggest that anti-beta2-GPI antibodies may play a more central role in certain clinical manifestations of APS than antibodies detected by the aPL ELISA or LAC </plain></SENT>
