<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and repeated pregnancy losses during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several experimental findings indicate that purified <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are directly responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-induced pregnancy losses, or for disruption of the annexin A5 shield at the trophoblastic interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that passive transfer of CIC15, a monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and annexin A5 that was isolated from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, induces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> in pregnant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanisms of CIC15-induced pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: We show that CIC15 induces fetal loss through a new mechanism that is probably related to procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time course is different from those of previously described models, and histologic analysis shows that the placentas are devoid of any sign of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> but display some signs of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, the CIC15 and 'inflammatory' models share some similarities: lack of FcÎ³RI/III dependency, and the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in preventing fetal losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this latter observation is here mostly attributable to anticoagulation rather than complement inhibition, because fondaparinux <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and hirudin show similar efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CIC15 enhances <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-induced thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, using a combination of surface-sensitive methods, we show that, although it binds complexes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-annexin A5, CIC15 is not able to disrupt the two-dimensional ordered arrays of annexin A5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This human monoclonal antibody is responsible for pregnancy loss through a new mechanism involving <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This mechanism adds to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the obstetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
