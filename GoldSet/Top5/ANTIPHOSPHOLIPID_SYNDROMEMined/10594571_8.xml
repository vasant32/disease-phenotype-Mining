<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) associated with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome are autoantibodies with specificity towards beta2-GPI (anti-beta2-GPI) or prothrombin (anti-II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are mainly screened by ELISA using polyoxygenated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some authors have claimed that immunoblotting can also be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure of cryptic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> or increase of antigen density on its binding to either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> or suitable plastic surfaces are the two hypotheses proposed for the interaction of beta2-GPI or prothrombin with their antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with aPL were studied: 25 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant (LA) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL), 10 with LA alone and 10 with aCL but negative LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with LA and aCL were positive for anti-beta2-GPI by ELISA and dot blot, while 15/25 had anti-IIELISA and 14 of them also had anti-II by dot blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient with LA alone tested positive for anti-beta2-GPI by ELISA or dot blot, whereas 6/10 had anti-IIELISA (five of them were also positive by dot blot) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four out of 10 aCL-positive patients had anti-beta2-GPI by ELISA and dot blot, while none of this group had anti-II by ELISA or dot blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding to beta2-GPI or prothrombin in both ELISA and dot blot was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> liposomes mixed together with beta2-GPI or prothrombin, whereas liposomal eluants retained it in both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parallel fluid-phase inhibition experiments using increasing concentrations (up to 200 microg/ml) of beta2-GPI or prothrombin demonstrated that antibody binding reduction was more evident on dot blot than on ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was almost completely abolished on dot blot, while on ELISA a moderate inhibition was achieved even at the highest protein concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, antibody binding on ELISA was virtually abolished when diluted sera were incubated with high protein concentrations applied to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We could infer that ELISA and dot blot detect antibodies with some differences in avidity but directed against native <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on beta2-GPI and prothrombin </plain></SENT>
