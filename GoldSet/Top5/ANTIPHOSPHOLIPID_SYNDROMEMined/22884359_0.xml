<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In experimental APS (eAPS), a mouse model of APS, behavioral abnormalities develop in the absence of vessel occlusion or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using brain hemispheres of control and eAPS mice with documented neurological and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, we checked for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e>, activation of glia and macrophages, as well as alterations of ligand binding densities of various neurotransmitter receptors to unravel the molecular basis of this <z:mp ids='MP_0004924'>abnormal behavior</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytic infiltrates were immunohistochemically characterized using antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8 and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFAP, Iba1 and CD68-immunohistochemistry was performed, to check for activation of astrocytes, microglia and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ligand binding densities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, AMPA, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptors were analyzed by in vitro receptor autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant inflammatory reaction occurred in eAPS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was neither activation of astrocytes or microglia nor accumulation of macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Binding values of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors were largely unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, ligand binding densities of the modulatory serotonergic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> receptors in the hippocampus and in the primary somatosensory cortex of eAPS mice were significantly upregulated which is suggested to induce the behavioral abnormalities observed </plain></SENT>
