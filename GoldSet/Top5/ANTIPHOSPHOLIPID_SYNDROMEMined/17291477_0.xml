<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (Lp(a)) and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) (apo(a)) may be markers for clinical features of 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and to compare with 37 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Apo(a) and Lp(a) concentrations were determined by ELISA and immunonephelometry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only elevated apo(a) concentrations were significant predictor for cerebrovascular insults (OR=14.399, p=0.005, 95% CI: 2.224-93.230) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that PAPS patients with cerebrovascular insults had recurrence of cerebrovascular episodes, measurement of apo(a) concentrations will help in the follow-up of those patients and thus in the prediction of future episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding should be further investigated in a larger study in order to provide adequate therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
