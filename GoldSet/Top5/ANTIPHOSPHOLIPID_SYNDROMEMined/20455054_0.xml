<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were detected, the diagnosis of a thus far undetected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) was confirmed, manifesting primarily by cardiac involvement and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite an advanced stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, the patient responded well to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the potential necessity of a heart transplant remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its atypical presentation impeded a timely diagnosis of SLE significantly, however, in retrospect the correct diagnosis would have been possible at an earlier time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Though rare, SLE represents an important differential diagnosis in cases of severe valvular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, particularly in young women </plain></SENT>
