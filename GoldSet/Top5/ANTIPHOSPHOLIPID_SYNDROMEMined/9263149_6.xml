<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe 5 patients with SLE with clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) but persistently negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their tested sera we found antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (a beta 2-GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 5 patients with SLE with at least 2 clinical manifestations of APS with no serum aPL detected in routine assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM a beta 2-GPI were studied by ELISA and by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also tested for antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, and phosphatidylserine by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied 54 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and one each had recurrent venous thromboses, repeated fetal loss, pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026976" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transverse myelitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient had serum aPL, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had high titers of IgG a beta 2-GPI (p &lt; 0.001 vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reactivity found in ELISA was confirmed by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a variant of APS in patients with SLE with negative aPL but serum antibodies to beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
