<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While studies exist demonstrating the role of APS in coronary artery bypass graft failure, its role in stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is less clearly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, a literature search of PubMed did not reveal any articles regarding the coexistence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> resistance and APS despite increasing awareness of resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 59-year-old male having recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> restenosis of multiple drug-eluting stents despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of seven drug-eluting stents in a course of eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was subsequently found to have mild elevation of IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody titers and resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term anticoagulation with a combination of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, and aspirin has been effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the patient's aCL titer level was not elevated above the level required by the current diagnostic criteria for APS, we believe that this patient suffers from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will discuss some of the controversies surrounding the diagnosis of APS as well as appropriate treatment and recognition of the coexistence of APS and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> resistance in patients with stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
