<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination for consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who had been diagnosed with APS (APS group) to detect potential embolic sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APS was diagnosed based on the modified Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group comprised age- and sex-matched cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients undergoing TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed and compared the clinical characteristics and TEE findings between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with APS and control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 582 patients, nine patients (nine women; mean age, 50 Â± 18 years) were classified into the APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 137 patients undergoing TEE, 41 age-matched female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were recruited to the control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were significantly higher in the APS group than in the control <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group (89 vs. 41 %, p = 0.027; 67 vs. 20 %, p = 0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> (odds ratio (OR), 13.71; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.01-185.62; p = 0.049) and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (OR, 8.06; 95 % CI, 1.17-55.59; p = 0.034) were independently associated with the APS group </plain></SENT>
