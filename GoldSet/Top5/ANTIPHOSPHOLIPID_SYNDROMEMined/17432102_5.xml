<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in clinical presentation of APS, the interrelations between various manifestations of the disease has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the principle associations between a variety of clinical manifestations in APS patients, applying factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-hundred and forty-six APS patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following disease manifestations were used for the factor analysis: recurrent fetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> (IUGR), venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, cardiac valves thickening/dysfunction, valvular vegetations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were further analysed in relation to sex and to primary APS versus APS associated with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five factors were derived, which accounted for 59.7% of the variance of the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factor 1 (which explained 18.5% of variance of the original matrix) represented the association between cardiac valves abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and AIHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factor 2 (13.8% of variance) represented association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factor 3 (10.3% of variance) represented an association between recurrent fetal loss and IUGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factor 4 (9.3% of variance) represented inverse correlation between arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Factor 5 (7.8% of variance) represented an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Application of factor analysis revealed specific clusters of cardiac, cutaneous, hematological and neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our result also point to a possible divergence of arterial and venous thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Awareness of these patterns might give us a better understanding of the disease </plain></SENT>
