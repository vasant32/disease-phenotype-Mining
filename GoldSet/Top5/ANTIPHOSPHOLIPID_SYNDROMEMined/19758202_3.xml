<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms at several loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), have been associated worldwide with SLE, although inconsistencies exist among these studies mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> between populations and sample characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate in Portuguese SLE the association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with clinical patterns of the disease and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred eighteen Portuguese patients with SLE--42% of whom had kidney involvement--were studied for HLA-DRB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory manifestations were correlated with HLA allele frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1 * 03 allele frequency was significantly higher in SLE patients--as a whole and as either with or without renal involvement--compared to controls, while HLA-DRB1 * 09 and DRB1 * 13 allele frequencies were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the relationship with the presence or absence of specific clinical manifestations, it was only found that HLA-DRB1 * 08 allele frequency was increased in patients with neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association with the presence or absence of anti-dsDNA, anti-sm or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were reproducible when analysis was repeated only with patients with more than 5 years of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As in other populations HLA-DRB1 * 03 is a susceptibility allele in Portuguese SLE patients, while HLA-DRB1 * 09 and DRB1 * 13 alleles may be protective alleles, not only for the disease, but for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlations with the different clinical manifestations were found, except with the neurological system </plain></SENT>
