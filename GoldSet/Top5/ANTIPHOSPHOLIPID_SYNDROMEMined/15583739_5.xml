<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of this cross-sectional study to investigate how thrombophilic factors contribute to venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in aPL-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In outpatient test centres at two tertiary care hospitals, two hundred and eight (208) persons requiring aPL testing were matched by age, gender and centre to 208 persons requiring a complete blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Persons were classified as aPL-positive (having anticardiolipin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies) or aPL-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several thrombophilic factors were studied using logistic regression modelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the aPL-positive group had three-fold more events (37%) than the aPL-negative group (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted analyses, clinically important associations were observed between factor V Leiden and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, and activated protein C resistance (APCR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR, 95% CI = 4.00, 1.35-11.91; 4.79, 2.03-11.33; and 2.03, 1.03-3.97, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for recruitment group, persons with both APCR and aPL had a three-fold greater risk (OR, 95% CI = 3.31, 1.30-8.41) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> than those with neither APCR nor aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, after adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, gender and recruitment group, persons with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> and aPL had a five-fold increased risk (OR, 95% CI = 4.90, 1.37-17.37) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> compared to those with neither risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, APCR phenotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> are associated with a higher risk of venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, respectively, in the presence of aPL </plain></SENT>
