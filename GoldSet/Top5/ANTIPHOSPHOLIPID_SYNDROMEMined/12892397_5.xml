<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported that oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>(oxLDL) is subsequently targeted by beta2-GPI and anti-beta2-GPI auto-Abs and that-carboxyl variants of 7-ketocholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi>, such as 7-ketocholesteryl-9-carboxynonanoate (oxLig-1) and 7-ketocholesteryl-12-carboxy (keto) octadodecanoate (oxLig-2), are ligands for beta2-GPI (J <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> Re 2001; 42: 697; J <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> Res 2002; 43: 1486) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These beta2-GPI ligands provide an electrostatic interaction between oxLDL and beta2-GPI followed by forming stable complexes (such as Schiff base adducts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The omega-carboxyl function in these ligand is responsible for beta2-GPI binding to oxLDL and the oxLDL-beta2-GPI complexes are anti-beta2-GPI auto-Ab-dependently taken up by macrophages (i.e., by phagocytosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our recent observations are consistent with the evidence that beta2-GPI co-localizes with lymphocytes and mononuclear cells in human athero-plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, autoimmune thrombogenesis (atherogenesis) is linked to interaction of anti-beta2-GPI Abs with the beta2-GPI-oxLDL complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose an alternative idea, that an immune response against the beta2-GPI-oxLDL complexes may be involved in mechanisms in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which has been explained by the theory of 'the response to injury' </plain></SENT>
