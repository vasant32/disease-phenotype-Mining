<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 43 pregnant women (23 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 20 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and class I sHLA concentrations were analyzed by ELISA in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester RESULTS: INF-gamma levels were below the method detection threshold and therefore were not included in the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and class I sHLA concentrations were observed in subsequent trimesters in the group of women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease in IL-10 in the 2nd trimester along with significant increase in TNF-alpha in the 3rd trimester were noted amongst the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant inter-group difference was observed in the 1st trimester when mean TNF-alpha level was significantly higher among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> women if compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed lack of significant differences between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> affected and control group pregnancies in their sHLA class I and cytokine concentrations may be related to the fact that the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was implemented early and continued throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> trimesters of the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
