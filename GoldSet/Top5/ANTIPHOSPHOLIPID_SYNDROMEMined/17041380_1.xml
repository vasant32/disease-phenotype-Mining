<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some authors have found a strong statistical association of antibodies to prothrombin (aPT) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS); others have not confirmed this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown if the detection of aPT, in addition to anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (abeta2GP-I) antibodies, provides additional information in the clinical study of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 466 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE; 24 had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 69 had secondary APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were tested by ELISA for serum aPT (IgG and IgM) using irradiated and plain plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also detected aCL and anti-beta2GP-I by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred sera from clinically healthy individuals were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six percent and 11% primary APS sera were positive for IgG and IgM aPT, respectively, compared with 3% and 5% of controls (p &lt; 0.001, both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in the frequency of aPT in SLE patients and controls, but aPT were positive in 46% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20% IgG, 33% IgM) and in 9% of those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (6% IgG, 5% IgM; p &lt; 0.001, both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, there was a significant difference in the frequency of aPT in SLE patients with (22%) or without (9%) secondary APS (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aPT titers decreased two- to sixfold when tested in plain plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five of 38 primary APS sera (92%) had IgG anti-beta2GP-I and 12 (31%) had aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient had aPT as the only antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The higher binding of aPT on irradiated plates suggests that aPT recognize a hidden <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> exposed by negative surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of aPT found in patients with primary APS, SLE with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or with secondary APS may suggest concerted pathogenic actions with other autoantibodies, but the detection of aPT does not seem to be of clinical value </plain></SENT>
