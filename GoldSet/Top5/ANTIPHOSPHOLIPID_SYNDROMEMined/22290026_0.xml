<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was examined in 12 patients with CSVT diagnosed in the past 9 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with abnormally decreased AT, PC or PS and one patient with APS were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients examined by a gene analysis of AT, PC, or PS, one had a congenital AT deficiency, one had a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e>, and two had congenital PS deficiencies including a novel mutant (Gly189Ala) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AT, PC and PS levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> decreased in one patient, PS level was decreased in three patients, and AT level was decreased in one patient at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CVST, but these concentrations improved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CVST is frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and a transient decrease in AT, PC or PS may be a causal factor </plain></SENT>
