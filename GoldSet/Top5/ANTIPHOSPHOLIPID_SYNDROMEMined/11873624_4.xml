<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 128 patients with SLE aged one to 73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA) were detected by an immunofluorescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (anti-Sm, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B and anti-RNP) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL of IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes) antibodies were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (71%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (71%) were the most common clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> was seen in 62.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe kidney damage was observed in 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>Pericarditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo> were observed in only 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological manifestations (16%) were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (SAPL) were observed in 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ANA were detected in 100%, anti-dsDNA in 76%, anti-Sm in 55.5%, anti-SS-A in 64%, anti-SS-B in 33.6%, anti-RNP in 49% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>aCL of IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes were detected in 63.5%, 49% and 40.6% of the patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only significant positive clinical associations were those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> with anti-dsDNA antibodies (p = 0.022) and malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> with anti-SS-A antibodies (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that tunisians with SLE present, in general, a mild form of disease predominantly manifested by cutaneous, musculoskeletal and hematologic involvement but low prevalence of major organ damage </plain></SENT>
