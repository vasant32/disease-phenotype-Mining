<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the clinical outcomes, PAPS is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> since the clinical and laboratory signs of ELE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus-like syndrome</z:e> occurred in two thirds of the patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of PAPS and ELE-associated SAPS differed at the height of disease: the signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> were prevalent in patients with PAPS and ELE-associated systemic manifestations were predominant in those with SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with APS who further developed ELE, unlike those with PAPS showed a high incidence of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of serological markers in patients with APS at its height did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared with healthy individuals, patients with APS were found to have the similar changes in the nonspecific immunological parameters manifested by absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, by the diminished Fc-phagocytosis of monocytes and neutrophils, by the elevated levels of circulating immune complexes, and by the high biocidal activity of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the immunity of patients with PAPS and in those with SAPS </plain></SENT>
