<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now present a possible association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>L.M. is a 32-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 2023, whose obstetric history includes three <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> and two infants with congenital anomalies including kidney atresia and oromandibular hypogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> offspring are twins born after receiving treatment of aspirin 80 mg daily during the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory evaluation revealed the presence of circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> cause endothelial cell activation which has been proposed as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case suggests the risk of not only recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> but also congenital anomalies in the offspring of a women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The congenital anomalies are 'regional' and could result from embryonic vascular accidents as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> interaction with endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only 'successful' pregnancy was with treatment with aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the associations illustrated in this obstetric history can be substantiated by population-based studies, it may be concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are a risk factor for embryo teratogenicity as well as mortality </plain></SENT>
