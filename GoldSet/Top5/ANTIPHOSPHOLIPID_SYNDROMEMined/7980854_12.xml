<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the present study we found that antiphospholipid activity in sera from patients with anticardiolipin antibodies was inhibited in vitro by therapeutic polyspecific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunoglobulins (IVIg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, F(ab')2 fragments from IVIg (IVIg-F(ab')2) inhibited the binding of anticardiolipin antibodies to the corresponding antigen in a dose-dependent fashion, thus suggesting that the interaction between IVIg-F(ab')2 and anticardiolipin antibodies occurred within or near the antigen combining site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximal inhibition ranged from 35.25 +/- 5.56 to 64 +/- 5.48% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients' IgG containing antiphospholipid activity specifically bound insolubilized IVIg-F(ab')2, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that IVIg obtained from a large pool of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors contain anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against idiotypes located on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our observations suggest that the reported favourable effect of high dose infusion of IVIg in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> may depend, at least in part on inhibition of the binding of such autoantibodies to the corresponding antigens (s) and/or inactivation of idiotype bearing B cell clones </plain></SENT>
