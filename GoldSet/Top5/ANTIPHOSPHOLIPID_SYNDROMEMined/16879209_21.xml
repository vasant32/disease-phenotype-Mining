<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that dimerization of beta2GPI by autoantibodies induces platelet activation, involving the platelet receptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E receptor 2' (apoER2') a receptor belonging to the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R) family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that dimeric beta2GPI, but not monomeric beta2GPI, interacts with four other <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R family members: the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R related protein (LRP), megalin, the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very-low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interaction between dimeric beta2GPI and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R, apoER2' and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-R was best described with a one-site binding model (half-maximal binding; approximately 20 nm for apoER2' and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>-R and approximately 300 nm for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R), whereas the interaction between dimeric beta2GPI and LRP or megalin was best described with a two-site binding model, representing a high- (approximately 3 nm) and a low-affinity site (approximately 0.2 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> receptors tested was unaffected by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27897">tryptophane</z:chebi> to serine (W316S) substitution in domain V of beta2GPI, which is known to disrupt the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also deletion of domain I or II left the interaction with the receptors unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of domain V, however, significantly decreased the affinity for the receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data show that dimeric beta2GPI can interact with different <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This interaction is dependent on a binding site within domain V of beta2GPI, which does not overlap with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site within domain V </plain></SENT>
