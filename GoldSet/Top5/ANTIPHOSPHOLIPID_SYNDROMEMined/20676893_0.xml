<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-five pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> using 100 mg/day <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> and 5,000 IU <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> every 12 h were evaluated in this prospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography was performed between 24 and 38 weeks of gestational age to assess estimated fetal weight, placental thickness, amniotic fluid index, fetal biophysical profile and Doppler evaluation of maternal uterine arteries, and fetal middle cerebral and umbilical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data regarding Apgar score, gender, delivery mode, and birth weight and length were recorded after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The observed values for ultrasonographic assessment and perinatal outcomes were not very different from the expected values for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The birth weight was 2863.3 ± 737.7 g (mean ± SD) and length was 46.8 ± 4.2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one newborn (4%) had the 1-min Apgar score &lt;7 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had the 5-min Apgar score &gt;7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gestational and perinatal evaluation of pregnant women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> using both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was reassuring </plain></SENT>
