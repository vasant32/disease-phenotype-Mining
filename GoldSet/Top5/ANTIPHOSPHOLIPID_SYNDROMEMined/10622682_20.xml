<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical characteristics at diagnosis and during follow-up of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to analyze the influence of treatment on their outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred patients with APS were included (86% female and 14% male; mean age, 36 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent had primary APS and 38% had APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median length of follow-up was 49 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of the patients had thromboses, 52% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and 60% of the women had pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS associated with SLE had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (P = .02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (platelet count lower than 100 x 10(9)/L) (P = .004), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (P = .0002), and low complement levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had recurrent episodes (86% in the same site as the previous thrombotic event) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrences were observed in 19% of the episodes treated with long-term oral anticoagulation, in 42% treated prophylactically with aspirin, and in 91% in which <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>/antiaggregant treatment was discontinued (P = .0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that prophylactic treatment and older age had an independent predictive value for rethrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment during pregnancy (usually with aspirin) increased the live birth rate from 38% to 72% (P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS have a high risk of recurrent thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term oral anticoagulation seems to be the best prophylactic treatment to prevent recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment with aspirin during pregnancy reduced the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> remarkably </plain></SENT>
