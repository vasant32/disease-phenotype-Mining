<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) as the only aetiological factor for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (RSA) are at increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study at a tertiary university referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 57 primary APS and RSA women (APS-RSA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control groups included: 86 patients with RSA of unknown aetiology (uRSA group), 42 patients with RSA and thrombophilic genetic defects as the only aetiologic factor for RSA (tRSA group) and 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) positive but otherwise healthy women (aPL group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main measurement was the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate after long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APS-RSA patients had a significantly higher 12-year cumulative thrombotic incidence rate compared with the three comparator groups (19.3% vs 4.8%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively (log rank), p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the APS-RSA group had 25.6 thrombotic events per 1000 patient-years (95% CI 12.8 to 45.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in relation to the presence (APS-RSA group) or absence (uRSA and tRSA groups) of aPL in patients with RSA was 15.06 (95% CI 3.2 to 70.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a history of RSA associated with aPL is a risk factor for subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the long term </plain></SENT>
