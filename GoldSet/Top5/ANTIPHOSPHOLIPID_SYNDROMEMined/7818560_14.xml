<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental primary APS was induced in naive mice following active immunization with anticardiolipin (aCL) monoclonal antibody (MAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-population or T cell-depleted bone marrow cells from mice with experimental primary APS were infused into total body-irradiated naive BALB/c recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow cells (in the presence of T cells) had the potential to induce experimental APS in naive mice, which resulted in high serum titers of aCL, antiphosphatidylserine, and antiphosphatidylinositol antibodies; an increased number of antibody-forming cells specific for each of the above <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>; a positive lymph node cell proliferative response to aCL MAb; and clinical features of primary APS, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (indicating the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>), and a high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> (the equivalent of human fetal loss) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell-depleted bone marrow cells did not transfer the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the important role of T cells in the development and transfer of experimental primary APS and raises the possibility of T cell manipulations in treatments to prevent this condition </plain></SENT>
