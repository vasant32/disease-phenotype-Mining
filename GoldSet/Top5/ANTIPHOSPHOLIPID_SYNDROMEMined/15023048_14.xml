<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and significance of oxLDL/alpha2-GPI complexes and antibodies to oxLig-1/alpha2-GPI were evaluated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The oxLDL/beta2-GPI complex was 69% positive (above mean + 3 SD of control subjects) in 97 consecutive patients with SLE, 62% in 40 patients with SLE with secondary APS, and 60% in 50 control patients with SLE without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-oxLig-1/beta2-GPI antibody was positive in 31 (32%) of 97 consecutive patients with SLE, in 26 (65%) of 40 patients with SLE with secondary APS, and in 6 (19%) of 32 control patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-oxLig-1/beta2-GPI antibodies were 93.7% specific with a positive predictive value of 90.0% for APS, better than anticardiolipin antibodies (80.0% specific, 71.4% predictive value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that oxLDL/beta2-GPI complexes are common in SLE and suggest a possible immunogenic role in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IgG anti-oxLig-1/beta2-GPI antibodies not only are associated with but also are clinically useful risk factors for APS </plain></SENT>
