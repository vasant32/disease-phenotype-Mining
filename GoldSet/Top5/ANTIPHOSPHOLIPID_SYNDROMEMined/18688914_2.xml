<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A renal small-vessel vasculopathy, defined as APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, has recently been observed in small series of patients with primary APS (PAPS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE)-APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the renal histologic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of different groups of patients with APS including catastrophic APS (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CAPS (n=6), PAPS (n=8), and SLE-APS (n=23) patients with biopsy-proven renal involvement who were referred to our departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The kidney biopsy specimens were retrospectively examined by the same renal pathologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CAPS had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> renal vascular lesions compatible with diagnosis of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> was detected in 3 of 8 (37.5%) patients with PAPS and in 8 of 23 (35%) patients with SLE-APS, while FIH and FCA were found with similar frequencies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 groups </plain></SENT>
