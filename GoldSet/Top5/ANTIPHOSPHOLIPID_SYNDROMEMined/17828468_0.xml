<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 19-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, factor V (FV) Leiden mutation in heterozygous state, and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was subjected to intravenous infusions of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH), and 16 days after the beginning of the treatment, his condition worsened, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and extension of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas the patient had a high clinical score for HIT II, functional and antigenic assays for the presence of HIT antibodies were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After repeated negative functional and antigenic assays, pseudo-HIT was suspected and nadroparin was introduced, which resulted in further worsening of the clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease remission, along with complete normalization of platelet count, was finally accomplished with the introduction of lepirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple comorbid states, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, can potentially make laboratory confirmation of disease more difficult in patients with HIT II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, it is of great importance that HIT II diagnosis be primarily clinical and that laboratory test results are carefully interpreted, especially when HIT is indicated by high clinical score values </plain></SENT>
