<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopaenia</z:e> and cerebral events in the patient described are likely to have been linked to her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the antibody and anticardiolipin antibodies are not necessarily synonymous and indeed we did not detect anticardiolipin antibodies in the patient, although her sister had them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is likely that they represent overlapping sets of immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production and analysis of further such antibodies, as described in this review, is awaited urgently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Much effort is also being expanded on identifying the precise targets for these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a very recent report Hörkkö et al have shown that these antibodies may be directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of oxidized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The management of patients with complex disorders such as described here remain a challenge, although in the short term the patient's major locomotor, neurological, dermatological and haematological problems have been controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term problems including impaired fertility and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> remain to be faced </plain></SENT>
