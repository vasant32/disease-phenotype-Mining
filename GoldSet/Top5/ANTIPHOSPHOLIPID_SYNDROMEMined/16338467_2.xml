<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (PE) originates in the placenta and is associated with deficient trophoblast invasion of spiral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The direct cause remains unknown, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> is often associated with circulating factors that can induce generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) in circulation are also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the quantification of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> is not currently used as a prognostic of the risk of PE, studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> play a role in PE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, the pathology of placentae from PE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> patients is similar; atherosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and infarction, and endothelium activation represent the pathological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a new antibody which recognizes non-bilayer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> arrangements (NPA) in membrane models and in cell membranes in vivo, and which triggered an autoimmune-like disease in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence of NPA in the placentae and in sera, and whether NPA induced NPA antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100603'>hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</z:hpo> (HDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed increased levels of NPA in the syncytiotrophoblast, extravillous cytotrophoblast, syncytial knots and the amnion epithelial cell membranes of the placenta, as well as increases in NPA and NPA antibodies in sera from HDP patients, when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that NPA derived from placenta could be one of multiple factors associated with pregnancy pathologies </plain></SENT>
