<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (aPS) is being considered in persons who have experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, it is important to gauge how well the history and laboratory data fit with this diagnosis as opposed to other causes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fewer the number of typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> risk factors and the more confirmatory the laboratory findings (ie, high anticardiolipin antibody titers or presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>), the stronger the suspicion of aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are no good prospective randomized data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention with any form of therapy following a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short-term anticoagulation with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 may be considered in these cases, as could antiplatelet agents if no clear cardiac source is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If anticoagulation is chosen, if there is no recurrence, and if the level of aPL appears to decline, a change to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention medication that may carry less risk, such as an antiplatelet agent, may be appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with more typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> risk factors and less confirmatory laboratory evidence of aPS (ie, low to moderate titer of anticardiolipin antibodies and lack of other clinical or serologic evidence of aPS), a more conservative approach may be considered and antiplatelet therapy initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In either situation, close follow-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> and aPL can help determine whether more or less aggressive (risky) therapies should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of randomized controlled trials of different treatment options for aPS are awaited </plain></SENT>
