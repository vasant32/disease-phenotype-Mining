<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome is immune mediated and, dependent, on CD4+T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether disease in these mice can be treated with blockade of T cell costimulation we treated them with the CD28 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CTLA4Ig at 9 or 12 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTLA4Ig completely prevented both SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> if it was given at 9 weeks of age, before anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies could be detected in the serum and prevented both B cell expansion and activation and the development of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If treatment was delayed until 12 weeks of age after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies had arisen but before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical disease, CTLA4Ig had very little effect on disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that CD4+T cell activation through CD28 is critical for disease initiation in this model but plays little role in disease progression or tissue damage </plain></SENT>
