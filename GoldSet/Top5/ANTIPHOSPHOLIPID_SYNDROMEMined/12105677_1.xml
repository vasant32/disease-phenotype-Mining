<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early in the disease, the peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> may be well recognised and studied by nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), a noninvasive and safe technique, that is reported to have both diagnostic and prognostic value, especially in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> (RP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classification of defined major NVC patterns in SSc might be useful in assessing the appearance and progression of the sclerodermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the NVC changes might represent a morphological reproduction of the evolution of the SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early appearance of giant capillaries and haemorrhages (Early pattern) is of great relevance for the early diagnosis of the SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these alterations are more evident in the active phase of the disease (Active pattern) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the NVC observation of loss of capillaries, vascular architectural disorganisation and the presence of ramified/bushy capillaries (Late pattern) represents the clearest aspect of advanced SSc microvascular damages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interesting, correlations between the NVC and clinical aspects of SSc, as well as the effects of therapeutical interventions have been observed </plain></SENT>
