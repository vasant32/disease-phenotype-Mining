<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LAC was detected in 27.2% of 349 SLE patients by a modified mixing kaolin clotting time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACL was detected in 34.7% by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only half of the patients who had LAC or ACL were positive for both of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, isotypes of ACL in these patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG isotype was detected in 81.8% of 121 patients, and more than half had only the IgG isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When clinical features of patients with LAC or ACL were studied, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were significantly higher in both groups compared with patients without LAC or ACL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the patients with both LAC and ACL showed the highest risk of fetal loss (89%) during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that LAC and ACL are detected in partly different groups of SLE patients, but both of these groups are clinically similar </plain></SENT>
