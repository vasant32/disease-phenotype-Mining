<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 165 patients with APS were enrolled and analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 124 female and 41 male patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>116 cases (70.3%), 34 cases (20.6%), 10 cases (6.1%), and 5 cases (3.0%) were classified as definite APS, probable APS, seronegative APS, and microangiopathic APS (MAPS) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 124 patients accompanied with other diseases, 113 (91.1%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (79.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>121 (73.3%) patients had episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with positive test of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) only were more likely to have episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than with positive anticardiolipid antibody (ACL) only (86.0% versus 55.7%; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 61 patients with prolonged APTT, the presence of LA was detected in 50 (82.0%) patients, and ACL in 34 (55.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS patients could be classified into several subgroups according to their clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Venous thromboses are more common than arterial thromboses, and positive of LA correlates <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> more than ACL </plain></SENT>
