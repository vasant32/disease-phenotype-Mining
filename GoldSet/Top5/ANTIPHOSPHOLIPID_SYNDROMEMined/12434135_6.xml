<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of aPLs in a group of 90 Chilean patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erytematosus (SLE) and 90 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs), antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPSs), anti-beta(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta(2)GPIs), and antiprothrombin antibodies (aPTs) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent technique using "in-house" assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four of 90 SLE patients (60.0%) had some type of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty of 90 (44.4%) were positive for aCLs, 9 of 61 (14.8%) had aPSs, 21 of 90 (23.3%) had anti-beta(2)GPIs, and 18 of 90 (20.0%) had aPTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, prevalences were as follows: aCLs, 3.3%; aPSs, 1.1%; anti-beta(2)GPIs, 1.1%; aPTs, 2.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, values were in the low-positive range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aPL detected, 29.5% was of the IgG isotype, 37.5% IgM, and 33.0% IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed a correlation between aCLs and aPSs and of these antibodies with anti-beta(2)GPIs and aPTs but not between anti-beta(2)GPIs and aPTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show a high prevalence of aPLs in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An association between different specificities and isotypes of aPLs was also observed </plain></SENT>
