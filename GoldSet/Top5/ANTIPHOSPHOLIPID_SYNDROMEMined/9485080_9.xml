<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of ciprofloxacin in mice with experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ciprofloxacin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi> (control antibiotic) was given to mice with experimentally induced APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The titers of autoantibodies, levels of cytokines, and number of cytokine-producing cells were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myeloid progenitor cells were determined by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit, and interleukin-3 (IL-3) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) was tested by Northern analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A decrease in the incidence of pregnancy loss and an improvement in the clinical manifestations of APS were noted in the mice treated with ciprofloxacin, compared with the mice given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of ciprofloxacin was found to be associated with increased serum levels of IL-3 and with increased IL-3 mRNA transcription in the splenocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was documented by elevated titers in the sera and elevated numbers of colony-forming cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin prevents the manifestations of experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect may be associated with increased IL-3 levels and GM-CSF expression </plain></SENT>
