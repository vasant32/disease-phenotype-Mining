<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes a wide spectrum of immune-mediated disorders such as immune complexes, production of autoantibodies to the inner ear proteins, production of anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002843'>cellular immune defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies have also found an elevation of total IgE levels and a type 1 immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to establish the association of "idiopathic" SSNHL (ISSNHL) with various autoantibodies, and to analyze the persistence over time of existing aCL and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (anti-beta2 GP1) antibodies in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we sought to establish a possible association between ISSNHL and total IgE elevation and whether this elevation is due to a specific type I immune reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this prospective follow-up study, 51 patients considered as having ISSNHL were compared with 35 age-sex matched healthy volunteers over a 3-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>serum antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, antithyroid antibodies, aCL, and rheumatoid factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who were positive for aCL antibodies were reanalyzed 3 months later for aCL antibody persistence and for the coexistence and persistence of anti-beta2 GP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Skin prick tests were performed in patients in whom total IgE was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> were positive in 9 of 51 (17%) and antithyroid antibodies in 11 of 51 (21%) ISSNHL patients, as compared to 1 of 35 (3%) and 2 of 35 (6%), respectively, in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rheumatoid factor was positive in 6 of the 51 patients (12%) and in none of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Positive aCL antibodies were present in 16 of 51 patients (31%), 6 of whom (12%) were also positive for anti-beta2 GP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three months later, aCL antibodies persisted in 7 patients (14%), and anti-beta2 GP1 in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (6%) were positive for aCL antibodies, which persisted in only 1 of them (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The level of total IgE was elevated in 14 of 51 patients (27%), in contrast to 3 of 35 controls (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Six of them (42%) demonstrated a positive skin test to at least 1 allergen, but only 3 presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the reported existence of multiple immune-mediated disorders in patients with ISSNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The lack of aCL antibody persistence in as many as half of our patients strongly suggests that transient phenomena (eg, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) may trigger aCL antibody activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of aCL antibodies, especially in conjunction with anti-beta2 GP1 antibodies, suggests that in some patients, SSNHL is included among the rare symptoms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
