<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the presence of anti-glycan antibodies (aGA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and associations between aGA and clinical features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from APS patients and healthy controls were analyzed for aGA levels by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the association of specific aGA with clinical manifestations of APS was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected aGA were affinity-purified and injected intravenously into naive mice which were tested for fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matrigel invasion assay was performed for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> cells (JAR) invasion and proliferation in the presence of selected aGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Culture fluid of JAR invasion assays was analyzed for the presence of MMP2 and MMP9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High levels of several aGA were found in APS sera, of which anti-GalNAc-β was significantly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Naive mice infused intravenously with anti-GalNAc-β developed increased fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-GalNAc-β significantly inhibited the in-vitro percentage of JAR invasiveness and the secretion of MMP2 and MMP9 by human JAR cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APS sera contain significant levels of aGA directed against several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-GalNAc-β Ab is specifically associated with recurrent pregnancy loss both in human patients and experimental mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic effects of anti-GalNAc-β include inhibition of JAR cells invasiveness accompanied by decreased MMP2 and MMP9 secretion </plain></SENT>
