<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a detailed examination of clinical events associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) syndrome in 96 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who underwent renal transplantation between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the retrospective nature of our study, we developed strict definitions of clinical events considered to be associated with the aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available hospital, clinic, and outside records of the patients with SLE who underwent transplantation at our center during this time period and noted the results of three standard serological tests for aPLs, when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up of the 96 patients was 62.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five of the 96 patients (88.5%) had at least one test for aPLs performed, and 25 patients (29.4%) had at least one abnormal test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these 25 patients, 15 patients (60%) had clinical events associated with aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (10.4%) either died of the aPL syndrome or had an aPL-associated clinical event within 3 months of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other morbidity from the aPL syndrome in these 15 patients included: thrombotic arteriolar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> (2 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4 patients), ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (7 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (6 patients), renal artery or vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (4 patients), peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (1 patient), and fetal wastage (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By comparison, among the 60 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aPL test results, only 5 patients had clinical events compatible with the aPL syndrome (P &lt; 0.0001 by chi-squared test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aPLs may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE undergoing renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study is the first attempt to quantify the impact of aPLs on renal transplantation in a large population of patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of aPLs in SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> is required to clarify the risks, benefits, and optimal clinical management of renal transplantation for these patients </plain></SENT>
