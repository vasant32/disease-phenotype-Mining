<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent scientific developments enable to better understand the strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of assay methods for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PLP)-dependent antibodies, measured as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) or as anti-PLP antibodies (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These latter are actually targeted at complexes of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and anionic PLP and also react with insolubilized beta2GPI alone in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> present little species specificity for beta2GPI, some of them bind preferentially to complexes of human beta2GPI and PLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAs are diagnosed with screening assays (dPT, dRVVT, KCT, APTT); their sensitivity is dependent on the concentration and type of PLPs used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are either beta2GPI or prothrombin dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the antibody-neutralizing capacity of PLP preparations (such as hexagonal phase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>) or their bypassing activity, confirmatory assays enable to confirm LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LAs and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> bind to different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on beta2GPI or its complexes with PLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major characteristics of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> assays are: the capture antigen (PLPs, beta2GPI source); its optimization and density on micro-ELISA plates; the efficacy of postcoating saturation; the animal serum used for saturation and diluent; the second antibody which must avoid nonspecific interactions; the calibrators proposed and their reference to international standards; the cutoff between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the pathological ranges; the assay sensitivity and overall specificity for <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New optimized assays have been developed to meet these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They are designed with PLP-coated plates, saturated first with immunoglobulin-free human serum as a source of beta2GPI, then with goat serum also used in diluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value is determined with at least 200 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma samples (mean + 3 standard deviations or 99th percentiles) and plasma samples from patients without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This approach offers both optimized specificity and sensitivity for testing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi>, along with a good standardization and it helps to measure the true <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APAs</z:chebi> associated with pathology </plain></SENT>
