<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 13 patients (4 males/9 females) with acquired hemidystonia in childhood is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of hemidystonia was 6.4 years (range 1-13.4 years); the mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> at the time of last follow-up was 11.4 years (range 3.6-23 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hemidystonia was caused by ischemic infarction in 9 patients and was attributed to perinatal trauma in 1; in 4 of the 9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in the remaining 3 patients laboratory investigations were suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 13 patients had delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>: between 1 month and 8.9 years (mean 3.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had neuroradiological evidence of contralateral basal ganglia damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and evidence of striatal damage on CT or MRI were important risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to medical treatment (trihexyphenidyl dose as high as 40 mg daily) in 5 patients was disappointing; 4 of the 5 patients who underwent functional stereotaxic operations were improved, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> was still present at the end of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study provides additional evidence that lesions of the striatum may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo>, supporting the theory of striatopallido-thalamic disconnection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results indicate that the occurrence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> must be considered in the diagnostic approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
