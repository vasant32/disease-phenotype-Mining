<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with APS, nine were positive for antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), five for anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI), four for both antibodies, and one for antibodies against prothrombin (aPT) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrin formation and lysis was followed by turbidity and plasmin generation using chromogenic substrate S2251 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymerization curves from RM patients without APS and the LA patient showed an increased slope and maximum turbidity compared to those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The speed of lysis was higher in the LA patient (21 +/- 0) 10(-4) deltaOD/seg and the RM patients without APS (19.6 +/- 5.7) 10(-4) deltaDO/seg, compared to that of the control group (14.5 +/- 2.8) 10(-4) deltaDO/seg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasmin generation increased only in RM patients without APS (85 +/- 24%) against the control group (52 +/- 3%), p = 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes observed in the fibrin polymerization and lysis process of women with RM without APS and LA seem to be related to their higher fibrinogen levels, while the increased plasmin generation was related to the patients' morbidity </plain></SENT>
