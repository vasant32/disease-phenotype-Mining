<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The IgG subclass and light chain distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) occurring in autoimmune patients were determined by means of two radioimmunoassays using either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>- or beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (beta 2GP1)-coated microtitre plates and mouse MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 50 sera selected for positivity of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) of the IgG isotype, 32 (64%) possessed anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies and their presence was closely associated with clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Good correlations were found between ACA and anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies when considering antibody level and patterns of light chain and IgG subclass, suggesting that, overall, the same antibodies were being measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light chain analysis showed the polyclonal origin of these antibodies and, in most sera, a trend towards use of lambda chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among sera positive for anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies, IgG2 was the major subclass reactive with beta 2GP1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (87% and 74% of the IgG antibody activity, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the group of 18 sera lacking anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies, ACA were largely restricted to IgG3, with a lesser contribution by IgG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A few selected sera from the anti-beta 2GP1-positive group were shown to contain mixtures of antibodies that required beta 2GP1 (restricted to IgG2 present in large amounts) and did not require this cofactor (restricted to IgG3 and/or IgG1 present in low amounts) for their reactivity with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no contribution of glycosylation to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies, even though human anti-carbohydrate antibodies are restricted to the IgG2 subclass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further emphasize the intra- and interindividual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of aPL, and should help to discriminate clinically relevant specificies </plain></SENT>
