<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate pregnancy outcome in women with APS according to their clinical phenotype, i.e. thrombotic and obstetric APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three pregnancies in 67 women with APS were included in the study, including 21 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (Group 1), 21 with late fetal loss or early delivery due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental dysfunction</z:mp> (Group 2) and 41 with thrombotic APS (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 3 had higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> (26.8% versus 4.7%, p = 0.05) than Group 1 and more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (SGA) babies than Group 2 (39.5% versus 4.8%, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 had significantly longer gestations compared with their pretreatment pregnancies (38.4 [28.4-41.4] versus 24.0 [18-35] weeks, p &lt; 0.0001) and 100% live birth rate after treatment with aspirin and low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, women with thrombotic APS (Group 3) have higher rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> than those with obstetric APS (Groups 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with aspirin and LMWH is associated with improved outcomes for women with previous late fetal loss or early delivery due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental dysfunction</z:mp> (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
