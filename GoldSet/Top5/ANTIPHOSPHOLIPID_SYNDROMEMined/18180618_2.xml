<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted an investigation to determine the antigenic determinants of antithrombin antibody (aThr), which has recently been recognized as a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> mostly co-existing with antiprothrombin antibody, employing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we found aThr in 34 of 83 patients (40.9%), and 27 of these 34 patients (79.4%) with aThr were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> negative for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An optical density value of six of 30 patients (20.0%) with aThr showed more than a 40% reduction of reactivity to thrombin with the addition of antithrombin in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inhibition percentage of aThr to thrombin was prominently increased to 11 of 30 (37%) along with its inhibition rate (100% at the highest) by the co-existence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 30 patients with aThr (23.3%) showed a reduction of the optical density value with the addition of hirudin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that aThr exists solely in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> without other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, and the antigenic determinants of aThr are directed to exosite I (hirudin binding site) and exosite II (antithrombin/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding site) on the thrombin surface, with exosite II predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, aThr could be an isolated and additional new marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>/hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since our patients who were positive only for aThr do not have a past history of antiphospholipid-associated complications at this stage, however, further long-term follow-up and additional studies in these clinical settings are needed to verify our hypothesis in the future </plain></SENT>
