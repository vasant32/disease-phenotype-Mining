<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A prospective echocardiographic study was carried out on 55 patients with the recently described 'primary' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> derived from three university medical centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of valvular lesions in patients with this syndrome was 38% compared with 4% in a control group of 55 healthy volunteers (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age of patients with valve abnormalities was 42 +/- 12 years and of those without, 30 +/- 10 years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had a morphologic echocardiographic pattern suggestive of non-infective verrucous mitral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had a two-dimensional or Doppler echocardiographic pattern of significant valvular dysfunction--either regurgitation or stenosis--without evidence of vegetations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mitral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> were the most common lesions in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of patients with valvular disease, haemodynamically significant clinical valve disease developed in four and surgery was required in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, particularly affecting the mitral and aortic valves, is common in patients with the 'primary' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, especially in those over 40 years old </plain></SENT>
