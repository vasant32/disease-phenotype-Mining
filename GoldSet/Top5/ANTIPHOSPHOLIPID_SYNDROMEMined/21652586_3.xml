<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicentre, case-control study was conducted to compare APS patients with successful and unsuccessful pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively considered 410 pregnancies of women diagnosed with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study focused on 57 unsuccessful pregnancies (considered the study population) and 57 successful pregnancies (considered the control population) matched for age and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had been treated with conventional protocol treatments including low-dose aspirin and/or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory features of the two groups of women diagnosed with APS were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The independent risk factors for pregnancy failure were: (i) the presence of SLE or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> [odds ratio (OR) 6.0; 95% CI 1.7, 20.8; P = 0.01]; (ii) history of both <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity (OR 12.1; 95% CI 1.3, 115.3; P = 0.03); and (iii) triple [Immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM aCLs plus IgG/IgM anti-Î²(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies plus LA] aPL positivity (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.0, 16.7; P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APS patients diagnosed on the basis of a single positive test and/or history of pregnancy morbidity alone were generally found to have successful pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It would seem from these findings that the risk of pregnancy failure in APS women planning to conceive can be stratified on the basis of some specific clinical and laboratory features </plain></SENT>
