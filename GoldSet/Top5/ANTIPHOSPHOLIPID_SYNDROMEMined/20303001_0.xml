<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this report is to sensitize mental health professionals to the psychiatric manifestations of APS during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report on this matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old pregnant woman, with no previous medical, obstetrical or psychiatric history, at the 18th week of pregnancy, acutely developed depressed mood, feelings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> with a strong premonition that "the fetus would die." Actual fetal loss ensued a few days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During induced labor, the patient had an agitated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, slowed mentation and apprehension persisted for at least 2 months after fetal demise and required pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APS diagnosis was established based on clinical events and persistent findings of antiphosholipid antibodies as well as multiple high-density foci in the subcortical white matter of the frontal lobes in brain magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric symptomatology, as well as a premonitory sense of upcoming loss of pregnancy, preceded actual fetal loss and APS diagnosis in the presented case, indicating that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> may present during pregnancy, perhaps as an early sign </plain></SENT>
