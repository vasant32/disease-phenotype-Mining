<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actual cause of APS is unknown but thought to be multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by the presence of a heterogenous population of autoantibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS presents either in isolation with no evidence of an underlying disease or in concert with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The wide diversity in clinical presentation often causes difficulty in identifying and treating patients and therefore a concise laboratory report containing interpretative comments is required to provide needed guidance to the clinician.For a diagnosis of APS to be made both clinical and laboratory classification criteria must be met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory testing to identify aPL antibodies includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (liquid-based clotting assays) and immunological solid-phase assays (usually enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay formats) for IgG and/or IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other autoantibodies, such as those directed against anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, can also be assayed; however they are not of clinical significance.Participation in a quality assurance program and an in-depth technical and clinical understanding of testing for aPL antibodies are required, as methods are limited by poor robustness, reproducibility, specificity, and standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing is further complicated by the lack of a "gold standard" laboratory test to diagnose or classify a patient as having APS.This chapter discusses the clinical and laboratory theoretical and technical aspects of aCL and anti-β2GPI antibody assays </plain></SENT>
