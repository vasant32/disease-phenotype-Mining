<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LA antibodies inhibit coagulation reactions in plasma because they appear to recognize the complex of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-bound (human) prothrombin, whereas aCL antibodies require beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2-GPI) for binding to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL antibodies can be divided into two subgroups, according to their behaviour in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-dependent coagulation reactions: aCL-type A enhances the anti-coagulant effect of beta 2-GPI, whereas aCL-type B does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the effect of purified aCL-type A and B and of LA antibodies on the procoagulant activity of both Ca-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> activated platelets and platelet-derived microvesicles, using an assay system with highly purified bovine coagulation factors Xa, Va, and prothrombin from human and bovine origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of beta 2-GPI neither type of aCL was able to inhibit the prothrombinase activity of platelets or microvesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a strong and dose-dependent inhibition of the prothrombinase activity of both platelets and platelet-derived microvesicles was observed within a few minutes, when aCL-type A antibodies were added in combination with beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect was dependent also on the concentration of beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, no inhibitory effect of aCL-type B antibodies on platelet- (or microvesicle) prothrombinase activity in the presence of beta 2-GPI could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LA antibodies were able to inhibit in a dose-dependent way the procoagulant activity of activated platelets and platelet-derived microvesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With two LA preparations this inhibition was only apparent when human prothrombin was used as substrate, while a third preparation exhibited its inhibitory effect both in the presence of human and bovine prothrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that, in the presence of their respective cofactors beta 2-GPI and prothrombin, aCL and LA antibodies interact with the membrane of activated platelets and platelet-derived microvesicles in a very similar way as previously observed for their interaction with anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces </plain></SENT>
