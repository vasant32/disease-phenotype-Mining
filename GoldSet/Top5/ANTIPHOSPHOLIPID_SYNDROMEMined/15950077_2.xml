<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients (20 male and 12 female) aged between 29 and 75 years (mean +/- SD: 56.4 +/- 12.34) with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous occlusive disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a history of venous occlusive disease within the previous 8 months were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were made by fundus examination and fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (FFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA), and IL-1beta were investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither aCL-IgM nor aCL-IgG was observed as positive in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only four patients were found to be ANA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, serum levels of IL-1beta were higher than those of controls (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean IL-1beta was found to be 18.06 +/- 3.39 pg/mL (mean +/- SE), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta levels were found to be significantly different from those of controls (2.7 +/- 0.68 pg/mL) (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody positivity</z:hpo> was not determined in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As a result, IL-1beta level appears higher in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venous occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This cytokine measurement might be used as a diagnostic indicator for venous occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
