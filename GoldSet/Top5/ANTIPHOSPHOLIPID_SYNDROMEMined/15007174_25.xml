<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FXI is activated in vitro by thrombin, or FXIIa in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we investigated the effect of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) on the activation of FXI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta(2)GPI bound FXI in vitro and inhibited its activation to FXIa by thrombin and FXIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affinity of the interaction between beta(2)GPI and FXI was equivalent to the interaction between FXI and high molecular weight kininogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of FXI activation occurred with lower concentrations of beta(2)GPI than found in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proteolytic clipping of beta(2)GPI by plasmin abolished its inhibition of FXI activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a mechanism of regulation whereby physiological concentrations of beta(2)GPI may attenuate thrombin generation in vivo by inhibition of FXI activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasmin cleavage of beta(2)GPI provides a negative feedback that counteracts its inhibition of FXI activation </plain></SENT>
