<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine which clinical features are associated with a positive anticardiolipin antibody in Irish patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five Irish patients with SLE were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were examined thoroughly, had their full history taken, and had case records reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of any clinical feature associated with the APS was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from these patients were tested for IgG and IgM ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only significant association found was between a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and the presence of ACA, although several other features were more common in ACA positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations with one or other isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study serves as a reminder to consider the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and other clinical features, if an SLE patient is positive for ACA </plain></SENT>
