<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 104 patients with APS (61 with primary APS and 43 with APS secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) and 106 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Lp(a) were determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition assays were performed to determine the presence of cross-reactivity between anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) and anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) were detected in 38 of 104 patients (37%) but in only 6 of 106 controls (6%) (chi2 = 28, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) were also higher in patients than in controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Titers of these antibodies did not correlate with plasma levels of Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) was significantly associated with that of anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (chi2 = 22.09, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the titers of anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) and anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (r = 0.59, P&lt;0.0001), and inhibition assays showed significant cross-reactivity between the 2 populations of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta2GPI were present in sera from 67 patients (64%) and 48 patients (46%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the titer of anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) and titers of either aCL or anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report for the first time the existence of autoantibodies against <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
