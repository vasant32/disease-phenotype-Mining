<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Is aPL directly responsible for disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What is the antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>What drives the production of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>What is the role of beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>What accounts for patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>Can a satisfactory animal model be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NIH workshop did not address important clinical questions, including those of pathogenesis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1994 many of these questions have at least partial answers. beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I appears to be an obligatory component of the antigen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e> is the probable central pathogenic event and animal models now exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are still critical unknowns that define a future research agenda: the genetics of the aPL syndrome, the relationship of aPL to SLE and mechanisms of pathogenesis (including why clotting is episodic and what is the cellular or anatomical location of the initial injury) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite a decade of clinical studies, risk prediction for defined patient groups is only now beginning to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are still almost no randomized, prospective, controlled treatment trials on any aspect of the syndrome nor are there definitive answers regarding which among antiplatelet, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or antithrombin therapies is superior, what is the role of immunosuppressive therapy and what experimental therapies might be introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The molecular biology of the antigen-antibody interaction will soon be fully understood, then the cellular and the organism biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Definitive treatment interventions may await this understanding but adequate therapies are available at this time to conduct important and effective prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
