<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several interpretations have been made regarding the specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and antibodies against oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL), but these are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we delineated specificity of these two types of antibodies and analyzed their regulatory effect on oxLDL and/or beta( 2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) binding to macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scavenger receptor-mediated binding of oxLDL (or its beta(2)GPI complexes) to macrophages was observed and the binding was partly prevented by beta( 2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IgG monoclonal anti-beta(2)GPI antibody (WB-CAL-1), which was derived from NZW x BXSB F1 mouse (a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>), significantly increased the oxLDL/beta(2)GPI binding to macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IgM anti-oxLDL natural antibody, EO6 (derived from apoe( -/-) mouse), prevented the binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different antigenic specificity of these antibodies to oxLDL and its beta(2)GPI complexes was also confirmed in TLC-ligand blot and ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, IgG anti-beta(2) GPI autoantibodies contribute to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism (housekeeping of oxLDL by macrophages) whereas IgM natural anti-oxLDL antibodies may protect against atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vitro data suggest that relatively high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (mainly contain IgG anti-oxLDL antibodies) might also prevent atherogenesis by inhibiting the oxLDL binding to macrophages </plain></SENT>
