<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of persistently high-titer (&gt; or =80 U) aCL-positive patients compared with those with persistent moderate aCL titers (40-79 U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second, we analyzed whether high-titer abeta(2)GPI test adds predictive information in persistently moderate-to-high titer aCL-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this cross-sectional study, the primary analysis compared the clinical and aPL characteristics of 58 patients with at least two moderate-titer aCL results to another 85 patients with at least two high-titer aCL results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the secondary analysis of patients with at least two abeta(2)GPI test results, we compared 29 patients with 'aCL 40-79 U and abeta( 2)GPI &lt; 80 U' profiles with 8 patients with 'aCL 40-79U and abeta(2)GPI &gt; or = 80 U', and also compared 27 patients with 'aCL &gt; 80 U and abeta(2)GPI &lt; 80 U' with 32 patients with 'aCL &gt; 80 U and abeta(2)GPI &gt; or = 80 U' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although aPL-related vascular and pregnancy events were similar between the moderate- and high-titer aCL groups, the number of patients with positive LA tests (RR 2.06, CI 1.38-3.08, p &lt; 0.01) and with at least one non-criteria aPL manifestation (RR 1.66, CI 1.20-2.30, p = 0.0005) were significantly higher in the high-titer aCL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes were statistically more common in the high-titer aCL group (RR 2.03, CI 1.04-3.94, p = 0.02), there was a trend towards increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac valve disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> occurring in the high-titer aCL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The secondary analysis showed that MRI white matter changes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac valve disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> were proportionally more common in the high-titer abeta( 2)GPI groups, suggesting a linear relationship between non-criteria aPL manifestations and aPL titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that patients with high aCL titers, compared with those with moderate titers, are more likely to have a positive LA test and a higher prevalence of non-criteria aPL manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high-titer abeta(2)GPI positivity may further increase the prevalence of non-criteria aPL manifestations in moderate- or high-titer aCL-positive patients </plain></SENT>
