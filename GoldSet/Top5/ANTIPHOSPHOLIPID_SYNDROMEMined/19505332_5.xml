<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine changes in disease status, treatment and health care utilization among adolescents transferring to adult care at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 31 eligible subjects who transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care at UCSF between 1995-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subject demographics, disease characteristics, disease activity and health care utilization were compared between the year prior to and the year following transfer of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at the last pediatric rheumatology visit was 19.5 years (17.4-22.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subject diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (52%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (16%), juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (16%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (13%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nearly 30% of subjects were hospitalized for disease treatment or management of flares in the year prior to transfer, and 58% had active disease at the time of transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the post-transfer period, almost 30% of subjects had an increase in disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died in the post-transfer period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median transfer time between the last pediatric and first adult rheumatology visit was 7.1 months (range 0.7-33.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Missed appointments were common in the both the pre and post transfer period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A significant percentage of patients who transfer from pediatric to adult rheumatology care at our center are likely to have active disease at the time of transfer, and disease flares are common during the transfer period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the importance of a seamless transfer of care between rheumatology providers </plain></SENT>
