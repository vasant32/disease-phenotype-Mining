<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the relationship of plasma concentrations of aPT antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes) and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (RSA) not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, we measured plasma aPT antibodies in 100 pregnant women at 8-12 weeks of gestation who had histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid-antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The controls were 200 healthy gestational-age-matched women with uncomplicated gestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) plasma aPT concentrations were significantly (P &lt;0.001) higher in women with histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> than in healthy controls [7.97 (0.79) and 2.08 (0.07) kU/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the concentrations of IgM aPT were significantly (P &lt;0.001) higher in patients than in controls [5.73 (0.85) and 1.83 (0.05) kU/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found for IgA aPT (P = 0.358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High concentrations of aPT antibodies (IgG and IgM isotypes) are associated with pregnancy loss in women with RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the antibodies may have a relevant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of the condition </plain></SENT>
