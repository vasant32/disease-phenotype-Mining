<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes two cases of massive gastric <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> due to primary APS, which presented in a span of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first case a multiparous, 40-year-old woman presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002248'>hematemesis</z:hpo>, and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo>, and was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002157'>azotemia</z:hpo> and shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A laparotomy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> of the stomach without any other organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was managed with a total gastrectomy and esophagojejunal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative serology revealed a persistent elevation of anticardiolipin antibody with no other apparent predisposing cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histopathological examination of the specimen revealed characteristic extensive intramural vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without inflammatory changes in the vessel wall, confirming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
