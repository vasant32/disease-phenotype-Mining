<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4464">Dexchlorpheniramine</z:chebi> (DH) is a classical or first generation <z:chebi fb="6" ids="37956">antihistamine</z:chebi> belonging to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16000,23981">ethanolamine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects related to these <z:chebi fb="5" ids="37956">antihistamines</z:chebi> are frequent, but the hypersensitivity reactions described in the literature since 1940 are exceptional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 32-year-old woman who experienced two episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">akathisia</z:e> secondary to intravenous (i.v.) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4464">dexchlorpheniramine</z:chebi> administration for a possible hypersensitivity reaction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Allergological study consisted of the following tests: skin prick tests with routine <z:chebi fb="18" ids="50904">allergens</z:chebi>, with a negative result; skin prick and intradermal tests with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> and DH, with a positive result to DH in the intradermal skin test (+ +); serum specific IgE, which was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels; <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> release test with DH with a negative result, and the basophil activation test (BAT) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> and DH, which was positive for DH and weakly positive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BAT is proving to be a highly useful tool in the field of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013182" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug allergy</z:e>, with a higher sensitivity and specificity than other in vitro tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because it avoids the need for provocation tests, this is especially important in drug-induced allergic reactions in which in vivo tests are repeatedly negative despite a clear clinical history </plain></SENT>
