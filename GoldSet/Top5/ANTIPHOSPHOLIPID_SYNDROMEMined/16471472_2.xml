<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS is sometimes lethal as a result of severe sequelae, which may be primary or secondary to the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two women who presented histopathologically with leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> as the first cutaneous manifestation and were subsequently diagnosed with APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 presented with widespread cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (WCN) with rapidly spreading pain down the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens from her leg <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> and WCN revealed perivascular infiltrates with neutrophils consistent with leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and thromboses of small-sized dermal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, painful cutaneous nodules with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and erythematous macules on her lower extremities, shoulder, and face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies of her right knee showed intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of small dermal vessels and infiltration of perivascular tissues with necrotizing granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that these various cutaneous manifestations with leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were present at an early stage of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although progression to leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in patients with APS is uncommon, our data suggest that the association between microvascular occlusions and cutaneous vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> has a predictive value for the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important for dermatologists to recognize these cutaneous signs to permit early and accurate diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
