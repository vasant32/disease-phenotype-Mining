<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 131 patients (105 females and 26 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into three groups: 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE, group 1), 63 patients with SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS, group 2), 45 patients with primary APS (PAPS, group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> RF questionnaire survey was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> on occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Such exogenic RF as intake of coffee, fat food, alcohol were not related to thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypodynamia was more typical for APS patients (21.3%) than for SLE patients free of APS (8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overweight for was characteristic for APS patients (49 and 34.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of smokers was higher in APS patients, though smoking did not provoke thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation was found between occlusion and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> administration, while occlusion and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment correlated inversely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> RF in patients with APS and PAPS are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and treatment with glucocorticosteroids </plain></SENT>
