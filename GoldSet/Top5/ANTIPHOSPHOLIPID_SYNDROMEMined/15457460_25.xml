<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracellular events involved in aPL-mediated platelet activation are not fully understood and are therefore the subject of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG fractions and their F(ab')(2) fragments were purified from the sera of 7 patients with APS and from the pooled sera of 10 healthy subjects (as controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK-1/2, and [Ca(2+)]-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) was determined in lysates of washed platelets pretreated with low doses of thrombin and aPL or control IgG or their F(ab')(2) fragments, by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of aPL on platelet aggregation in the presence or absence of a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">Thromboxane</z:chebi> B(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2)) production was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on gel-filtered platelets treated with aPL and thrombin, with or without SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calcium mobilization studies were done utilizing a fluorometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of platelets with IgG aPL, or their F(ab')(2) fragments, in conjunction with subactivating doses of thrombin resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the IgG aPL nor their F(ab')(2) fragments increased significantly the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pretreatment of platelets with SB203580 completely abrogated the aPL-mediated enhanced aggregation of the platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Platelets treated with F(ab')(2) aPL and thrombin produced significantly larger amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) when compared with controls, and this effect was completely abrogated by treatment with SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, cPLA(2) was also significantly phosphorylated in platelets treated with thrombin and F(ab')(2) aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in intracellular [Ca(2+)] when platelets were treated with aPL and low doses of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data strongly indicate that aPL in the presence of subactivating doses of thrombin induce the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26996">TXB</z:chebi>(2) mainly through the activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent phosphorylation of cPLA(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ERK-1/2 pathway does not seem to be involved in this process, at least in the early stages of aPL-mediated platelet activation </plain></SENT>
