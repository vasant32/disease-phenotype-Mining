<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the importance of the anticardiolipin test in diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is widely accepted, there remains much misunderstanding about the strengths and weaknesses of this assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several disorders result in formation of low levels of the antibody, hence the anticardiolipin test is not specific when results are low positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, the higher the anticardiolipin level the greater the likelihood of a diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence there have been numerous efforts to enable reproducible measurement of anticardiolipin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard calibrators were introduced to construct calibration curves from which levels of unknown samples can be derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those standard calibrators were made by mixing varying quantities of high positive with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More recently, calibrators derived from monoclonal anticardiolipin antibodies have been introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are advantages and disadvantages with both types of calibrators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determination of a precise and reproducible anticardiolipin level is difficult, whatever the calibrators used, because the assay is dependent on several variable components, any of which may fail on any given day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Utilization of a semi-quantitative measure (low, medium, high) may suffice in most clinical settings and would be less subject to error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Validated ELISA kits may offer greater reproducibility, since there is less variability than bench assays set up in very different laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether using a kit or a bench assay, meticulous attention to detail offers the best opportunity for precision and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
