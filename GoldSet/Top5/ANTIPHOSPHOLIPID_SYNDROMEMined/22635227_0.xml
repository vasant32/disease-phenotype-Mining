<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Obstetric morbidity (OM) is a common feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (OAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Women having OAPS-only and women with OM related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) but not fulfilling APS classification criteria (OMAPS), may show similar patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this research was to collect records of OAPS and OMAPS cases in order to have valuable information about their clinical features, laboratory, treatment, pregnancy outcomes and long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EUROAPS/EUROMAPS is a registry in the frame of the European Forum on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibody</z:hpo> projects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its own website has been available since June 2010: www.euroaps.org </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This registry comprises 211 women including 304 pre-enrolment pregnancies, and 226 prospective cases, 194 of OAPS and 32 of OMAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OM was more frequent in OAPS than in OMAPS, independent of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the prospective cohort, standard aPL data was available in 202 cases and treatment data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 226 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good fetal outcomes were obtained when low dose aspirin plus low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of thrombotic events and/or cases evolving into full-blown <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OAPS could be a different form of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OMAPS/OMAPS fetal outcomes were better when treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and progression to SLE were lower than in 'classical' APS </plain></SENT>
