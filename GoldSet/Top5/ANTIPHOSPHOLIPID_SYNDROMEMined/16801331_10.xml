<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 114 patients diagnosed with SLE were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MBL polymorphisms were investigated by sequencing-based DNA typing of the promoter and exon 1 of the MBL2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotypes 0/0, 0/XA and XA/XA were considered as MBL-low genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was observed in patients carrying MBL-low genotypes compared with those carrying MBL-high genotypes [30 vs 9%, P = 0.012, odds ratio (OR) 4.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-16.46] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with MBL-low genotypes also presented higher mean values for total cholesterol (228.6 vs 202.3 mg/dl, P = 0.017) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol (139.9 vs 121.9 mg/dl, P = 0.045), a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (30 vs 4%, P = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (30 vs 11%, P = 0.043), heart valve lesions (71 vs 32%, P = 0.026), cardiac valve dysfunction (57 vs 7%, P = 0.0004) and associated APS (39 vs 12%, P = 0.005), a higher mean Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> International Collaborating Clinics score (2.09 vs 1.26, P = 0.029) and a lower prevalence of low C4 levels (43 vs 71%, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of genetic, clinical and immunological variables showed that only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) was independently associated with cardiovascular events (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in our SLE patients carrying MBL-deficient genotypes was 3.3 times higher than in patients with non-deficient genotypes, only APS was independently associated with cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the higher frequency of thrombotic events in SLE patients carrying MBL-deficient genotypes might be related to coexisting APS </plain></SENT>
