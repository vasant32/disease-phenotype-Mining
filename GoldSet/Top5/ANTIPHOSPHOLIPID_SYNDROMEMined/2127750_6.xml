<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients with IgG antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (ACLA) were studied to determine their in vivo formation of the platelet aggregating and vasoconstricting substance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (TxA2) and the platelet inhibiting and vasodilating substance prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was done by measurements in urine of their enzymatically formed metabolites 2,3-dinor-TxB2 and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>, respectively, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is demonstrated that patients with IgG ACLA have a highly significant increase in the biosynthesis of TxA2 compared with age-matched healthy controls (807 +/- 163 [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>] vs. 230 +/- 15 pg mg-1 creatinine, P = 0.0000005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant increment of the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> was also found (189 +/- 23 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) vs. 125 +/- 11 pg mg-1 creatinine, P = 0.03), although this was much less pronounced than that for TxA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the highly increased formation of TxA2, reflecting platelet activation, in patients with IgG ACLA is of pathophysiologic relevance for their tendency to arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and hence that they should be considered for prophylactic treatment with inhibitors of TxA2 formation, like aspirin </plain></SENT>
