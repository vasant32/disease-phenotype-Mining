<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and recurrent venous and/or arterial thrombotic events, fetal loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such an association has not been carefully assessed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of aPL in anti-U1-70 kDa autoantibody positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 48 consecutive anti-U1-70 kDa autoantibody positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> versus 59 consecutive anti-U1-70 kDa autoantibody negative patients with SLE to determine the frequency of aPL and clinical features of the aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> 7/48 (15%) had anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) versus 24/59 (41%) patients with SLE (p &lt; 0.005) and versus 2/150 (1%) apparently healthy blood donors (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> with aPL, 2 were IgG, 3 IgM, and 2 both IgG and IgM isotypes; among patients with SLE 5 were IgG, 11 IgM, and 8 both IgG and IgM isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clotting events or other features of the aPL syndrome were found among the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> compared with 26 events documented among the group of aCL positive patients with SLE (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients with SLE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, one with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, 2 with recurrent fetal loss, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, one with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: aCL were increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aCL were increased in SLE compared with both patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, while clotting events and other manifestations of the aPL syndrome occurred among the group of aCL positive patients with SLE these were distinctly absent from the aCL positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
