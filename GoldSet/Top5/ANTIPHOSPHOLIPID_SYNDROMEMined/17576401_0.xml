<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: It has been established that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e>, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms that characterize <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and recurrent pregnancy losses are still not clear.However, it is known that they are associated with the presence of antibodies directed against anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and putative cofactors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the pathogenetic role of annexin A5, a potent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> cofactor protein for its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> property in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e>, was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endothelial cells of human umbilical veins ''EAHY2936 Line'' in culture were used, incubated with antiphospholipid anticardiolipin (ACA) antibodies purified from plasma of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of annexin A5 on the cells with ACA was investigated by immunofluorescence and by confocal microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The negative control was also carried out: EAHY cells in cultivation medium without ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confocal analysis revealed a uniform distribution of annexin A5 on the cellular membranes in the negative control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, in EAHY cells with ACA, the annexin A5 appears distributed in irregular manners on the cellular membranes (cytoplasmic and nuclear) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of an irregular ''cluster'' distribution of annexin A5 on the EAHY cells in presence of aPL, and in agreement with the literature, demonstrated that aPL, inhibiting annexin A5 ability to protect anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, promote the coagulation factors to diffuse laterally against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
