<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical charts of 34 women (a total of 41 pregnancies) treated between January 1992 and March 1995 with the low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> enoxaparin were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients (87.5%) received one daily 40-mg injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, treatment was continued throughout labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Therapy was administered for 5-280 days (median 91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One case of a thromboembolic event was recorded during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No systemic or local side effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, only one patient had mild vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, which resolved spontaneously while therapy was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no excessive intrapartum <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in any of these patients, whether delivered vaginally or abdominally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During treatment, 19 of the 34 patients underwent 24 surgical procedures, including 13 cesarean deliveries, without excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidural anesthesia was used during labor in nine of the patients, with no specific complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The corrected perinatal mortality rate, (ie, the rate of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after 24 weeks' gestation plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo>, excluding a neonate with multiple anomalies) for those neonates delivered after 24 weeks' gestation was 2.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> in any of the neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This preliminary series, the largest reported to date, demonstrates the relative safety and efficacy of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in pregnancy and delivery </plain></SENT>
