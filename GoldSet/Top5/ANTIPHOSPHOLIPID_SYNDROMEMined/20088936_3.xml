<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this diagnostic classification of APS appeared to be the most sensitive, the APS-associated serological criteria are still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: We prospectively observed the second pregnancy of 284 women with a previous embryonic loss, both with and without aPL-Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aPL-Ab-positive women were more prone to pregnancy loss, embryonic loss, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> and intrauterine fetal growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type IIa aPL-Ab positivity (LAC present alone) was associated with the highest risk of recurrent embryonic loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type I aPL-Ab positivity (combinations of aPL-Ab type positivity) was associated with the strongest risks of late complications, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, abeta2GpI-M positivities were not clinically relevant in these women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with a first unexplained pregnancy loss before the 10th week of gestation who are also positive for aPL-Abs have a higher risk of various complications in their second pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, measurement of abeta2GpI-M had a questionable prognostic value </plain></SENT>
