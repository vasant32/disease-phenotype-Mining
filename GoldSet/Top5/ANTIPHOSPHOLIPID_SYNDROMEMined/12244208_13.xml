<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of sera sequentially obtained from seven individual mice at different ages showed that six proteins, vimentin, heat shock protein 60, UV excision-repair protein RAD23, alpha-enolase, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein L, and nucleophosmin, were the targets of the B cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp>, and that autoantibodies to them were synthesized sequentially in an orderly pattern that recurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the male WB mice analyzed: anti-vimentin first and anti-nucleophosmin last, with anti-RAD23 and anti-heat shock protein 60, then anti-alpha-enolase and anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein L Abs occuring concomitantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-vimentin reactivity always appeared before anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and anti-DNA Abs, suggesting that vimentin is the immunogen initiating the autoimmune process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 proteins recognized by female WB sera differed from that of male sera, indicating that the Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration gene is not an accelerator but a strong modifier of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, 1) combining two-dimensional PAGE and mass spectrometry constitutes a powerful tool to identify the set of Ags bound by autoantibodies present in a single serum and the whole autoantibody pattern of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>; 2) the diversification of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> in male WB mice occurs in a predetermined pattern consistent with Ag spreading, and thus provides a useful model to further our understanding of the development of the autoantibody response in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
