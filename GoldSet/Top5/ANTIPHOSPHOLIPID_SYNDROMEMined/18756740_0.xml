<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of possible localizations of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in AphS is pseudoinfective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (PsIE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed analysis of clinical and laboratory features of APhS, associated with PsIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>28 APhS patients with PsIE, average age--44+/-13 years, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them 21 patients had primary form of APhS, 7 cases had secondary form of APhS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For statistical treatment of the results the logistic regression (SPSS for Windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Release 11.5.0.) was used, the confidence level of differences between groups was determined with the use of Student's test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart valve abnormalities occurred in 100% of patients and included valvular thickening, induration and <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, the presence of valve vegetations, focip of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003761'>calcinosis</z:hpo> and different grade of valve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mitral and aortal valve vegetations occurred with the same incidence (64%), both valves were been involved in 29% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive associations with presence/development of PsIE in APhS from multivariant model data included mitral valve lesion (OR: 0.029), focal cardiofibrosis (OR: 0.084), prior valve lesion (OR: 0.087), negative associations--hemicrania (OR: 8.627) and secondary form of APhS (OR: 6.425) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moderately high titer of lupous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (multivariant model) (OR: 3.753) seemed to be prognostic marker of PsIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In half of patients with APhS and PsIE <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolisms</z:mpath> appeared, embolic cerebrovascular complications were the most frequent (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The possibility of development of hemodynamically significant valve dysfunction that needs valve replacement and nececcity of making of differential diagnosis with infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> are related to other aspects, important for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
