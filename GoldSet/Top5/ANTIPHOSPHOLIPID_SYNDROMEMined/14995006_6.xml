<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) profile of patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) is different from that of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (SAPS), we studied 123 patients, 34 of whom presented PAPS and 35 SAPS due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 54 SLE patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and 166 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles were typed using amplified DNA hybridized with sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, PAPS patients exhibited a nonsignificantly increased frequency of DR53-associated alleles, and SAPS patients presented an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*03 alleles (corrected P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA-DRB1*03 alleles were over-represented in SAPS patients presenting anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) (Pc = 0.02), in SLE patients as a whole (Pc &lt; 0.0001), and in SLE patients without APS (Pc = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of aCL among SLE patients presenting or not HLA-DRB1*03 alleles was closely similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A trend to an increase in the frequency of the DQB1*0604 allele (14.3 versus 4.2%, P = 0.03) and of the DQB1*0302 allele (31.4 versus 12.7%, P = 0.01) was observed in SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that the association of SAPS with HLA-DRB1*03 is due to the association with SLE and is not due to aCL, and suggest that the HLA class II profile of PAPS is different from that of SAPS </plain></SENT>
