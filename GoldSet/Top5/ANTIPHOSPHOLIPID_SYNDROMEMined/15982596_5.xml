<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e> associated with recurrent arterial and venous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed our experience with five APS patients who underwent cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three of them the diagnosis of APS had been established before surgery, two patients were diagnosed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1999 to March 2004 five patients with APS underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their clinical data, operative and postoperative courses, and the long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedures performed were heart and lung transplantation (patient 1), endoventriculoplasty and CABG (patient 2), biventricular resection of endoventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (patient 3), mitral valve repair repair and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, patient 4), and mitral valve replacement with closure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (patient 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were three perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (patients 1, 2 and 3), two of three patients in whom the diagnosis was known before surgery, survived (patients 4 and 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, only half the dose of protamin (patient 4) and no protamin at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (patient 5) was applied to reduce the probability of postoperative thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 year follow up, only patient 4 had survived, patient 5 had died of the complications of intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS undergoing cardiac surgery belong to a high risk subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, though rare, APS can be a critical issue in cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of the cardiac patients with unexplained perioperative thromboembolic complications, such as graft occlusion, may turn out to have an undiagnosed APS </plain></SENT>
