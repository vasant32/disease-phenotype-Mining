<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of natural autoantibodies involved in homeostasis relies on the ability to distinguish between exposed/masked and altered/non-altered self antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this article were to address the relationships between antigen and autoantibodies against serum amyloid A (SAA), define SAA protein concentrations in 219 blood donor (BD) sera and determine their autoantibody levels and search for possible clinical associations with autoimmune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Just recently, an increasing number of reports have indicated significantly decreased levels of autoantibodies against pro-inflammatory molecules, such as anti-TNF-alpha, anti-IL-6, or anti-CRP found in diseased conditions, as compared to healthy donors, or even to less severe disease conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In accord with this line of thought, our data indicate a predominant presence of anti-SAA autoantibodies in healthy BDs (above 95% as tested by the immunoblot analysis, n = 41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using ELISA, high levels of anti-SAA antibodies were confirmed with a median OD = 0.996 for the BD group (n = 219) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that anti-SAA antibodies might have a physiological role in homeostasis and/or the innate immune system and could actually be a part of the natural antibody repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, lower median levels were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on 219 BD sera, we could establish a new median value of 20 μg/ml for SAA antigen and a cut-off value of 114.7 μg/ml (97.5th percentile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly, higher concentrations of SAA were observed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, rheumatoid arthritic, and SLE patients </plain></SENT>
