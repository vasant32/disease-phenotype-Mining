<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other clinical factors exist in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients which may have an additive or preventive effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a cross-sectional study to analyse additive clinical thrombotic risk factors and possible preventive treatments in APS patients, and to compare the results with those obtained in asymptomatic aPL-positive (no history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or pregnancy morbidity) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 77 APS patients with non-gravid thrombotic events (group A) and 56 asymptomatic aPL-positive patients (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study periods were defined as 6 months prior to the time of first vascular event in group A and 6 months prior to the patient's last visit in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed to evaluate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e>, regular cigarette smoking, oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapy, surgical procedures, pregnancy with or without an APS-related event, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, any history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> or the use of aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or immunosuppressives during the study periods was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bivariate statistical analysis and logistic regression tests were performed to compare groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group A, 75% (n=58) of patients and in group B 48% (n=27) of patients had at least one of the additional risk factors during the study periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the bivariate analysis, pregnancy (P=0.005) and surgical procedures (P=0.04) were significantly more frequent in group A, while aspirin (P&lt;0.001), hydroxychloroquine (P&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (P=0.002) were used significantly more frequently in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, the probability of an event was decreased by taking aspirin and/or hydroxychloroquine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women only, the probability of an event was increased with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and pregnancy or surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking and the presence of more than one risk factor were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While traditional risk factors were similar between groups, pregnancy and surgical procedures increased the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking were associated with arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Possessing a combination of risk factors may increase the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Use of aspirin and/or hydroxychloroquine may be protective against <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in asymptomatic aPL-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
