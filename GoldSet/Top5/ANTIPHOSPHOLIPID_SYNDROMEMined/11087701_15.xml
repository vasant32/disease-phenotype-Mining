<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and clinical and serological associations of anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies (anti-P antibodies) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> (CTDs) and investigate the immunobiological nature of autoantibody clustering in which anti-P antibodies play a part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG anti-P antibodies in the sera of 267 patients with CTDs and 31 healthy subjects were analysed by immunoblotting performed on cytoplasmic extract of Raji cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 32 systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 46 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e>, 16 poly/dermatomyositis, 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 8 undifferentiated CTD, 72 overlap CTD, and 22 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-P antibodies were affinity purified by elution from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> bound antigen and tested by ELISA for their binding activity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-P antibodies were detected in 16 (6%) patients and in none of the controls: 12/60 SLE (20%) and 4/80 undifferentiated/overlap patients with CTD (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A close association of IgG antibodies with P proteins and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> sera (p=0.0009, odds ratio 18.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-P antibodies from 9 of 12 anti-P <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> serum samples could be affinity purified and none of the affinity purified fractions cross reacted with ELISA plate coated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-P immunoreactivity is a specific marker of SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease and its detection is recommended as a powerful diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-P antibodies are strongly clustered with IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> sera, even if they are independently elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that their cognate autoantigens play a part in a common pathogenetic pathway in SLE </plain></SENT>
