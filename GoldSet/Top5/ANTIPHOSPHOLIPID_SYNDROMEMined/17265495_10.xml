<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I may bind to factor XI and serve a physiologic function as a regulator of factor XI activation by thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to investigate the possible interactions of beta(2)GPI with thrombin in beta(2)GPI-regulated factor XI activation by thrombin and to evaluate the effect of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies on this system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The beta(2)GPI interaction with thrombin was investigated in direct and competitive assays using beta(2)GPI domain mutants and thrombin-binding exosite oligonucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I inhibition of thrombin-mediated factor XI activation was assessed in the presence of 8 anti-beta(2)GPI monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Domain V of beta(2)GPI was involved in direct binding to thrombin, and exosite I and exosite II on thrombin took part in this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI mAb produced a &gt;70% inhibition of thrombin-mediated factor XI activation in the presence of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that beta(2)GPI interacts with thrombin exosites I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel finding necessitates a reinterpretation of previous studies from which the detection of anti-human thrombin antibodies in APS has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also show that anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies potentiate the inhibitory effect of beta(2)GPI on thrombin-mediated factor XIa generation </plain></SENT>
