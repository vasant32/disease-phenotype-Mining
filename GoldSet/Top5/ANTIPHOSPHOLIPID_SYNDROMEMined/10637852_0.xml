<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is an uncommon complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, attributed to many different etiopathogenic mechanisms such as early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, cardiogenic embolism, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to analyze the incidence, clinical and immunological characteristics of this condition and to evaluate the therapeutic approach and evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We present the cases of six patients with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> who also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in our series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age was 45 years (range 13-67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred whilst the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in three of the patients and two patients had potentially embologenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the patients required treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for their severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> and 66% received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> for an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and/or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was satisfactory in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but the one who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> is low, and generally appears during advanced, active phases of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The many etiopathogenic mechanisms involved generally act together so that it is difficult to say which is the main cause, especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Amongst these mechanisms is the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, detection of which is essential in this condition, and cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The evolution depends mainly on the multi-organ involvement and how early immunosuppressive and/or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is started </plain></SENT>
