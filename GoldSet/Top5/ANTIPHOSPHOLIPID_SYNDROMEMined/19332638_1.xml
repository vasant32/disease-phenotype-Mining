<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed immunophenotypic abnormalities on lymphocyte subsets in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed an extended immunological study to define alterations of distinct T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell subsets in obstetric patients with APS and their relationship with APS-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients and controls: 36 women with APS [Sydney criteria, Group A1 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=26), Group A2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=10)]; and 36 age matched women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (disease controls; Group B), 36 healthy parous women (healthy controls; Group C), and 36 healthy nonparous women (healthy controls; Group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic events occurred after history of abortions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> A2 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-color whole-blood flow cytometry was used to characterize the distinct immunophenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A1 patients had significantly higher percentages of CD4+CD45RA-CCR7+ central memory cells (A1 vs D), higher percentages of activated CD4+CD25+ T cells (A1 vs D), and lower percentages and absolute counts of CD4+CD45RA-CCR7- effector memory cells (A1 vs D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A2 patients had higher percentages and absolute numbers of CD19+CD27-IgD+ naive B cells (A2 vs A1 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls), lower percentages and absolute numbers of CD3-CD56+CD16+ NK cells (A2 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls), and higher percentages of activated CD4+DR+ (A2 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls), CD8+DR+ (A2 vs A1 vs C vs D), CD4+CD38+DR+ (A2 vs D), and CD4+CD25+DR+ T cells (A2 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased percentages of CD8+DR+ T cells [relative risk (RR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.09-5.44, p=0.02] and of naive B cells (RR 3.05, 95% CI 1.30-7.11, p=0.009) were associated with development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In obstetric patients with APS we documented significant changes in T, B, and NK cell homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of CD8+DR+ and CD19+CD27-IgD+ cells might identify obstetric patients with APS at risk of having <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
