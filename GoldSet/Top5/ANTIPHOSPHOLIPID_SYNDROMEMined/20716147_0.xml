<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal failure</z:e> because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal haemorrhage</z:e> is the leading diagnosis, while another possible mechanism is autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prospective evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis in patients with APS has not been previously performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulatory patients (age 18 years and older) with APS were given a symptom questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>, corticotropin (ACTH) and adrenal cortex autoantibodies (ACA) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> was measured at baseline and after 1-mcg ACTH stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 24 patients (18 women/6 men; mean age 44.6 +/- 16.1 years) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 had primary APS with disease duration of 5.8 +/- 6.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level was 12.6 +/- 4.2 mg/dl (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 7-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After ACTH stimulation, it was 24.7 +/- 4.1 mg/dl and 22.8 +/- 7.4 mg/dl at 30 and 60 min respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> level of at least 18 mg/dl, although three patients had stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> between 18 and 20 mg/dl, one of which reported previous inhaled steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>Weakness</z:mp>, dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> were reported at baseline by 50%, 38% and 25% of the patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ACA were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, patients with APS did not have <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis insufficiency </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further longitudinal studies are needed to determine the significance of periodic evaluation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
