<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had a platelet count above 150 x 10(9)/l, and 11 patients had mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of 50-150 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of platelet autoantibodies was investigated by immunofluorescent binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the presence of autoantibodies on platelets and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binding of antibodies in patients' serum and platelet eluates was investigated by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> as antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven patients antibodies to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> were present in platelet eluates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation was measured by flow cytometry using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) labeled monoclonal antibody to P-selectin (CD62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The binding of anti-P-selectin to patients' platelet surface P-selectin was not increased, compared with the binding to platelets obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> concentration in APS patients was significantly lower than that found in the platelets of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More studies are necessary to determine the exact role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and to elucidate the cause of low <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels in platelets of APS patients </plain></SENT>
