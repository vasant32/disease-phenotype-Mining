<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analysed in vitro the complement-fixing activity of anticardiolipin antibodies (C-fix aCL) from patients with persistent and moderate/high titres IgG aCL antibodies: 21 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 11 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Titre and C-fix ability of aCL were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>APS and non-APS patients were similar with regard to mean levels of IgG aCL (46 +/- 24 versus 51 +/- 30 GPL, P = 0.7), frequency of IgM aCL (P = 0.7) and a comparable predominance of IgG2 aCL reactivity on ELISA (95% versus 100%, respectively, P = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, a high frequency of C-fix aCL (71% versus 92%, P = 0.35) was observed in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no difference was observed in the mean level of C-fix aCL in APS and non-APS patients (7 +/- 6 versus 9 +/- 8 SDunits, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 10 primary and 11 secondary APS also revealed a comparable IgG aCL mean titre (57 +/- 29 versus 37 +/- 11, P = 0.06), frequency of IgM aCL (P = 0.6) and of C-fix aCL (70% versus 73%, P = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among APS patients six had exclusive arterial events and seven exclusive venous events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IgG aCL mean titre (36 +/- 10 versus 36 +/- 11 GPL, P = 0.9) and the frequency of IgM aCL antibodies (P = 0.56) in these subgroups of patients were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend of higher frequency of C-fix aCL in patients with exclusive venous events (100%) compared to 50% of those with exclusive arterial events (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, C-fix aCL titre was higher in the former group compared to the later one (8 +/- 5 SDunits versus 2 +/- 2 SDunits, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the notion of a high frequency of C-fix aCL in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although it does not discriminate those patients without thrombotic events with persistent moderate/high levels of aCL, this property seems to be more relevant in venous events and may provide the basis for further understanding the distinct pathogenic mechanisms underlying arterial and venous occlusive disorders of APS </plain></SENT>
