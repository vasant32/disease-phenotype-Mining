<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A primary syndrome was in fact recognized in 1985 by the author while at the Hammersmith Hospital and comprised 25 patients who conformed to this new subset of disease, which has now overtaken <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-associated (secondary) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndromes</z:e> in frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, publication of this important milestone was in fact prevented, because of the purveying dogma at that time that "these patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suffering from '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>,'" which history has since proved to be incorrect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The syndrome was therefore only clearly defined AND published in 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, in the following year, a new and more comprehensive multicenter series comprising 70 patients was documented (including the original 25 patients from 1985) as well as two smaller series by other units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The catastrophic variant of the syndrome with distinct triggering factors, clinical features, and a generally poor prognosis was then defined in 1992, with more than 300 patients with this devastating condition now summarized on the University of Barcelona online registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The existence of a seronegative syndrome has also been suggested, but whether this is related to the presence of undetectable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> or perhaps represents a similar type of vasculopathy or endotheliopathy is unclear at the present time </plain></SENT>
