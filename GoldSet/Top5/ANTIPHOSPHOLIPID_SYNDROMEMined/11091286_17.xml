<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CL expression on cell surface was demonstrated by high performance thin layer chromatography analysis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> from plasma membrane purified fractions and by the positive staining with the CL-specific dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25589">nonyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding was complemented with the observation that aCL IgG purified from patients with APS bind to the surface of apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This staining shows a clustered distribution mostly localized on surface <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>blebs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CL exposure on the cell surface preceded the DNA fragmentation, as shown by cytofluorimetric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that exposure of CL molecules on the cell plasma membrane is an early event of the apoptotic cellular program that may represent an in vivo trigger for the generation of aCL </plain></SENT>
