<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (APLA) are often associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, defining the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) but it remains unclear why many subjects who are positive for APLA chiefly anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) or anti-beta2GPI (abeta2GPI) do not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A related question addressed in this study is whether the target of cellular injury in APS is predominately platelets or endothelial cells (EC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aCL and abeta2GPI were determined by ELISA in 88 patients, 60 of whom were thrombotic and 28 non-thrombotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation was measured by CD62P and by concentration of platelet microparticles (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi>) and EC activation was assessed by endothelial microparticles (EMP), both by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) was measured in the hospital laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in frequency of aCL or abeta2GPI, neither IgG or IgM, between the thrombotic and non-thrombotic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups showed elevated EMP compared to controls but this did not differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="38786">PMP</z:chebi> were not significantly elevated in non-thrombotic but were elevated in thrombotic compared to non-thrombotic (p=0.03) and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD62P, an independent marker of platelet activation, was also elevated in thrombotic vs. non-thrombotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for increased LAC in the thrombotic group but not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects had evidence of endothelial activation, only platelet activation differed between thrombotic and non-thrombotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that platelet activation predisposes to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> EC activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data also raise the possibility of distinguishing risk-prone APLA-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
