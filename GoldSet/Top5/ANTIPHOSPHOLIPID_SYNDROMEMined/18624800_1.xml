<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous small studies have investigated whether aPL are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in the general population--with contradictory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the question was addressed by studying the prevalence of aPL in members of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs differing in their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such twins provide a unique natural experiment, matched as they are for age, sex and genetic factors, and allow the role of environmental factors, such as aPL, to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite 95% power to detect a difference of 0.59 IgG units per litre in anticardiolipin antibody IgG titres, no difference in prevalence of aPL could be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-discordant MZ twins </plain></SENT>
