<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a hospital-based case control study on women with no antecedent of thromboembolic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 3 groups of 518 women: patients with unexplained primary recurrent early foetal loss, patients with explained episodes and mothers with no previous obstetrical accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matching the 3 groups was carried out on the basis of age, number or pregnancies and time elapsed since the end of the last pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant biological markers were then prospectively tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The various antibodies were shown to be dependent on parity and on the presence of previous foetal loss: cut-off values were thus calculated using data obtained from the group of explained accidents, and adjusted for parity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> IgM [odds ratio: 6.0, 95% confidence interval (2.3-15.7), p = 0.0003], anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I IgG [4.4, (1.6-11.7), p = 0.0035] anti-annexin V IgG antibodies [3.2 (1.2-8.1), p = 0.015] and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [3.0, (1.3-6.8), p = 0.009], were found to be independent retrospective risk factors for unexplained early foetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These four markers were subsequently found to be, during the following pregnancy, associated with a significant risk of foetal loss despite a low-dose aspirin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non-thrombotic, non-auto-immune women with unexplained primary recurrent early foetal loss, subgroups of patients with positive anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> IgM antibodies, or positive anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I IgG antibodies, or positive anti-annexin V IgG antibodies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> must be particularised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This should allow therapeutic trials to be carried in well-defined patients </plain></SENT>
