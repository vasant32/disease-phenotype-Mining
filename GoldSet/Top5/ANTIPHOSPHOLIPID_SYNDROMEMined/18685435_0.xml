<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Half of the nonstroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> patients had a preceding arterial catheterization history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was a common contributing underlying disorder among both catheterized and overall groups (28 and 42%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third most common underlying risk factor for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, and 70% of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and 30% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was the heart, and 22% of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> following cardiac surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prothrombotic risk factors were also analyzed in the study group and factor V G1691A and PT G20210A heterozygous mutations were detected to be higher (16 and 4%, respectively) than those in healthy controls (7.4 and 2.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to factor V G1691A and PT G20210A mutations, other prothrombotic risk factors including protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> and elevated factor VIII levels were commonly associated with pediatric nonstroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> cases in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates the importance of these factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> development, similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another striking factor of the study is the higher number of prothrombotic risk factors (more than three) in patients who had persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, indicating the need for more intensive treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
