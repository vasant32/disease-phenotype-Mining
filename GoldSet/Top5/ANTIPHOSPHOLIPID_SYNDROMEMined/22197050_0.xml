<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Intracardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (ICT), more commonly encountered at autopsy, are well documented with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of ICT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> without an intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this autopsy study was to highlight such an occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1996 to 2010, cases with ICT unrelated to primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> were selected at autopsy and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and investigational data were obtained from the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The location, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, size, and histological appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were then classified on the basis of their location, nature, and histology (fresh and/or organized); this was correlated with the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a total of 11,724 autopsies performed in 15 years, 276 patients (2.4%) had ICT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 45 patients (0.4%) had ICT that were unrelated to primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 25 men and 20 women with a mean age of 46.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antemortem diagnosis was not made in any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients each (35.6%) showed isolated left-sided and multichambered involvement, while the rest of the hearts (64.4%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the right-sided chamber(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recognizable risk factors were underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (24.4%), prolonged immobilization (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (6.7%), pregnancy (4.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (4.4%), primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (2.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, 16 patients (35.7%) had no obvious predisposing factor, although investigations for prothrombotic markers had not been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of the lower limbs had been clinically documented in some of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in most patients (73.3%) had been related to pulmonary and/or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This autopsy study emphasizes the great need for a higher index of suspicion of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the heart in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> so as to curtail the morbidity and mortality of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> process </plain></SENT>
