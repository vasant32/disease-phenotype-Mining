<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: Previously we reported on the generation of experimental anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These models were employed to evaluate the efficacy of various novel therapeutic modalities including interleukin-3 (IL-3) and low dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the latter was found to be interrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low dose aspirin is capable of inhibiting the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase which is responsible for the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> towards the production of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This shifts the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> to the other pathway and leads to an overproduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> act as stimulators of IL-3 production, a positive cytokine in pregnancy which enhances placental and fetal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the current study we evaluated the IL-3 levels in pregnant women with APS and expanded our knowledge on the interrelationships between aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites and IL-3 in the human system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-3 levels were recorded in the serum of pregnant women with APS and compared to a control pregnant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects were incubated with different concentrations of aspirin or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolites (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">Leukotriene B4</z:chebi>, C4 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>), and IL-3 production in the culture fluids was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum level of IL-3 in pregnant patients with primary APS, APS secondary to SLE and SLE was lower in comparison to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in vitro studies revealed that only low dose aspirin (10 mg/microliters) stimulated IL-3 production while higher doses of the drug failed to induce the cytokine generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">Leukotriene B4</z:chebi> and C4 were stimulatory whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> acted as inhibitor of IL-3 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The serum level of IL-3 is decreased to pregnant women with primary or secondary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low dose aspirin is capable of stimulating IL-3 production in vitro most probably through an elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> production, which may explain its beneficial activity in preventing the manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
