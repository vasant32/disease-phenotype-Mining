<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare live birth rates in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and either autoantibodies or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo>, treated with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus aspirin (LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> alone, and to place our results in context with other randomized clinical trials (RCT) with similar cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The HepASA Trial was an RCT including patients with a history of RPL and at least 1 of the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL), an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, or antinuclear antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment groups were stratified by aPL status and history of early versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received either LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes included adverse events and bone loss at the spine and femoral neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Literature over the past 20 years was reviewed to identify comparable RCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 4 years, 859 women with RPL were screened: 88 (10.2%) fulfilled inclusion criteria, became pregnant and were randomized to receive either LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>aPL were present in 42 (47.7%) patients in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped after 4 years when an interim analysis showed no difference in live birth rates in the 2 groups, and a lower rate of pregnancy loss in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> only group than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> group, 35/45 (77.8%) had a live birth versus 34/43 (79.1%) in the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> only group (p = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither number of prior losses nor aPL status was correlated with pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of pregnancy related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean change in BMD did not differ by treatment group at either the lumbar spine (p = 0.57) or femoral neck (p = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RCT since 2000 for aPL positive women with RPL and similar inclusion criteria report a mean live birth rate of 75% with either LMWH or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> did not confer incremental benefit compared to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> alone for this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Regardless of treatment regimen, number of prior losses, or aPL positivity, almost 80% of women in our RPL cohort had a successful pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings contribute to a growing body of literature that contests the emerging standard of care comprising LMWH/<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> for this population </plain></SENT>
