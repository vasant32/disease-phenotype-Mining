<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found the presence of Ba2+- and Sr2+-dependent IgG, IgM and IgA-aPT in up to 65% of patients negative for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent IgG-, IgM and IgA-aPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maximally 69% of them were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the measurement of Ba2+- and Sr2+- along with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-dependent aPT may become a clinically useful tool to correctly detect patients with antiphospholipid-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, further study is needed to clarify the clinicopathological differences among these aPTs in the future </plain></SENT>
