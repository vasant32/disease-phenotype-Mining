<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, new guidelines for LA detection were published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to compare tests recommended under these guidelines with other methods used for LA detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 336 subjects suffering from various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), diluted Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and diluted prothrombin time (dPT) tests for LA detection together with a ratio between sensitive and insensitive aPTT reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also tested if LA was dependent on β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2) GPI) using one of the recently described methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> LA tests performed were associated with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest odds ratio (OR) for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was found for β(2) GPI-dependent LA but sensitivity was low (OR = 8.4; specificity/sensitivity = 98%/15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> LA tests showed a much stronger association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than with pregnancy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA tested by aPTT and/or dRVVT (at least one out of two tests positive), as recommended by the guidelines, was associated less strongly with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR = 4.1) than either of these tests separately (OR = 5.0 and 4.3, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With both tests positive ('double LA positivity') the association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was stronger (OR = 6.5) compared with only one positive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In fact, 'double LA positivity', detected by combinations of any of the tests studied, was markedly associated with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
