<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms mediating the deleterious influences of Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> include foam cell formation and cell cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The production of anti-Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies results in the formation of immune complexes which are taken up at enhanced rate by macrophages, leading to foam cell formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS is characterized by repeated venous and arterial thromboembolic phenomena, recurrent fetal loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, associated with the presence of antibodies to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (aPL) (i.e. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">Phospholipids</z:chebi> bear structural resemblance to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and several studies have indeed proved that aPL display cross-reactivity with anti-Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed the capacity of oxidized and native forms of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> to aggravate the clinical picture of experimentally induced APS in naive mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice were actively immunized intradermally with anticardiolipin antibodies and developed a clinical picture resembling APS in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the mice were infused with either Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> or PBS, and similar regimens were applied to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APS mice infused with Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were found to exhibit a significantly more severe form of the disease in comparison with native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>- and PBS-infused mice, expressed by lower platelet counts (261,000/mm3, 535,000/mm3 and 455,000/mm3, respectively), longer activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (99 +/- 12 s, 63 +/- 8 s and 74 +/- 8 s, respectively) and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rates (72.7%, 34.4% and 32.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show that Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, compared with native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, aggravates the clinical manifestations of experimental APS and suggest that cross-reactivity of Ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> may provide a pathogenic explanation for this effect </plain></SENT>
