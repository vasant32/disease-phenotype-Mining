<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Initial studies showed that passive immunization with human immunoglobulin G fractions containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can result in murine fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intended to use the murine model to study mechanisms of fetal loss associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we have since found variable effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> on murine pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the consistency of murine pregnancy loss from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> containing immunoglobulin G fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant C3H/HeN (mated with C57B1/6 males) and BALB/c (mated with BALB/c males) mice were passively immunized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> containing human immunoglobulin G fraction from 20 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice received either a single dose of 10 to 30 mg on day 12 of pregnancy or 10 mg per day on days 12 to 14 of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some mice receiving each dose of immunoglobulin G fraction were bled to confirm serum levels of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice were killed on day 15 and the fetal status was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, passive immunization with individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> containing immunoglobulin G fractions resulted in 801 live pups (75%), 232 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (22%), and 38 resorptions (3%) in 131 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect of immunoglobulin G fractions from individual patients was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin G fraction from eight women resulted in high rates of fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in spite of high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, fetal outcome was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in mice immunized with immunoglobulin G fraction from the majority of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not uniformly increase with increasing doses of immunoglobulin G fraction and was unrelated to the donor's medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fetal outcome was similar for both C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have variable effects on murine pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> that do and do not cause murine fetal loss may provide insight into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> relevant to fetal loss associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
