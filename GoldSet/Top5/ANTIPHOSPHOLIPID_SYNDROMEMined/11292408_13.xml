<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate ocular features in patients presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A descriptive study of 13 patients presenting with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> involving anterior and posterior segment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 1 to 125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive report of ocular involvement, including visual symptoms, visual acuity, clinical characteristics, funduscopic and fluorangiographic features, was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic associated symptoms were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations included anticardiolipin antibody titers and isotypes, presence of other autoantibodies, and markers of immune system activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common ocular symptom at presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> (eight patients) followed by redness and pain(three patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>(two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior segment abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001101'>iritis</z:hpo> (eight patients) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100532'>scleritis</z:hpo> (two patients) and filamentary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000491'>keratitis</z:hpo> (one patient), were present in 76% of patients, whereas the most represented feature of posterior involvement was <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (60%) followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> (38%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (15%), posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0100532'>scleritis</z:hpo> (7%), and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had abnormal titers of anticardiolipin antibodies, predominantly IgG isotype; six had markers of immune system activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although posterior pole disease is more commonly associated with anticardiolipin antibodies, the anterior segment can also be involved with a wide spectrum of features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100532'>Scleritis</z:hpo> has never been previously described as associated with anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Systemic symptoms are frequently present in association with ocular disease </plain></SENT>
