<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The association of antiphosphatidylethanolamine antibodies (aPE) as the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aPE was described as the sole antibody in many cases suggesting APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aPE was not included in the Sapporo criteria for the classification of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the clinical features of 20 patients with aPE only; 17 patients had symptoms potentially related to APS (group 1) and three had other manifestations (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 15 women and five men, mean age was 35 +/- 12 years at the beginning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1 (n = 17), ten patients presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (five had both), and six microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, lacunar pathology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aPE positivity was persistent in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of four patients (three women) presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> with peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> which started before 45 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factor associated with aPE persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2 (n = 3), there was no thrombotic event, one demyelinating pathology, one microvascular pathology, and one <z:mp ids='MP_0002191'>arterial dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aPE positivity was never confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, 13 patients presented an APS with aPE only, confirmed at least 8 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study points out that testing for aPE would be of interest for patients when symptoms were potentially related to APS, particularly when other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This description questions the enlargement of the APS biological criteria defined in Sapporo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The role of aPE in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is considered </plain></SENT>
