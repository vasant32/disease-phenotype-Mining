<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six women with primary APS were evaluated prospectively for clinical features of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> and anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>/chromatin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 45.7 months, anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>/chromatin antibodies were detected in only one patient (2.8%), who developed features of SLE including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthritis</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>-like lesions, and an autoantibody profile suggestive of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>/chromatin antibodies in primary APS patients is very low, and they may be associated with the development of SLE manifestations </plain></SENT>
