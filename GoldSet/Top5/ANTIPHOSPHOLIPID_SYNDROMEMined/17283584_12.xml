<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 272 lupus patients were followed up for five years during which the presence of aPL antibodies [anticardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC)] were determined, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> thrombotic incidents and antithrombotic therapy-related data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, three groups were constituted, an aPL- group with 107 aPL negative patients, an aPL+ group with 81 aPL positive patients without clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) group with 84 aPL+ patients who met the Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAC was more common in the APS than the aPL+ group (32.1% versus 9.9%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of clinical thrombotic events was significantly higher when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of aPL were present compared to only aCL positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow up, aPL appeared in 7.5% of the aPL- group, and 2.8% of this group had thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the aPL+ group, thrombotic events reoccurred in 1.9% of those receiving antithrombotic prophylaxis and 6.9% of those without primary prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, thrombotic events reoccurred in 8.3% of the APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that LAC, constant and cumulative presence of aPL and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are positive predictors for the development of thrombotic complication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
