<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They affected only individual segments of a monocular visual field and finally occurred several times daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical and cardiological examinations as well as echocardiography were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests revealed a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high titres of serum antibodies against <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundoscopy did not show any vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>--possibly as an expression of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0866588" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematodes</z:e>--was suspected, high-dosage treatment with steroids was commenced, but failed to influence the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While steroid dosage was gradually decreased, administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> (for three months 100 mg daily, then three times daily 100 mg) brought about complete disappearance of the visual signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their cause was probably a reversible platelet aggregation induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> which, because of the physiological characteristics of the terminal <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular bed brought about the isolated sign of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
