<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven consecutive children with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated separately for time of development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, insertion of a central venous line (CVL), history of L: -asparaginase usage, and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prothrombotic risk factors such as factor V G1691A and prothrombin G20210A mutation, protein C, protein S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo>, factor VIII and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) elevation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 387 children with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 37 (9.5%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was detected in 9 patients at the time of diagnosis, during maintenance therapy in 25 patients, and after the discontinuation of treatment in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One or two additional prothrombotic risk factors other than L: -asparaginase therapy and insertion of central venous lines were present in 20 of these patients (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that eight patients had the factor V G1691A mutation in the heterozygote state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of them had the factor V G1691A mutation associated with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and one patient had the factor V G1691A mutation associated with factor VIII elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One had the the prothrombin G20210A mutation in the heterozygote state, four had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) elevation, two had factor VIII elevation, one had a decreased protein S level, one had a decreased protein C level, one had antiphospholipid positivity, and two had histories of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancy</z:e> is an important risk factor for the development of childhood <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> increases when accompanied by additional prothrombotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For this reason, especially children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and at high risk for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, such as those who have received L: -asparaginase or a replaced CVL during their therapy, might be screened for additional prothrombotic risk factors and appropriate measures might be taken to prevent the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
