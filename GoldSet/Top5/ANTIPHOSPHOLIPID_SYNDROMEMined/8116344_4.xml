<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the five monozygotic and one of the eight dizygotic pairs were concordant for SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>10 of the 15 patients showed clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo>, and 11 had abnormal MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 12 patients were considered to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropsychiatric lupus</z:e> (NPSLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 11 patients with long-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment had either central or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High or moderate aCL level was found in eight patients and two co-twins </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ANFAs were found in five patients and four co-twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five co-twins fulfilled some of the SLE criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of them, three MZ twins and one additional DZ co-twin with no ARA criteria had findings suggesting central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the majority of SLE patients has cerebral abnormalities either as a result of SLE, or concomitant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The co-twins without clinical SLE often have minor signs of SLE, and even they may have neurological and MRI abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, their aCL and ANFA levels seem not to correlate with MRI abnormalities </plain></SENT>
