<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathologic correlations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) have so far only been examined in case reports and highly selected series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the incidence of aPLs in 156 consecutive, unselected autopsies and correlated the pathological findings with the clinical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevations of aPLs were found in 20.5% of the autopsy population, compared with 9.6% of age- and sex-matched controls and 2% of healthy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in patients with elevated aPL levels compared with those without, but the histology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was similar in both groups, with no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the aPL-positive individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and cardiac valve lesions had a high incidence of aPLs, as reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five cases that fit the designation of primary antiphospolipid antibody syndrome were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study concludes that aPLs are relatively common in a hospital autopsy population and are commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, that the thromboemboli are not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and that primary aPL syndrome is more common than generally appreciated </plain></SENT>
