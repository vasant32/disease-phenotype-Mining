<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data regarding the outcome of patients with APS who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen APS patients who underwent PCI between the years 2003 and 2008 were compared to 380 patients who had undergone PCI during the same period (PCI group) and were matched by age (Â±5 years), gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, APS patients were compared to 1,458 patients with ST segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) who were treated with PCI during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six-month to 4-year clinical outcomes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The indication for PCI in the APS group was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome in 52.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 1 year of follow-up, patients with APS had higher rates of target vessel revascularization than the other two groups, which translated to higher rates of major adverse cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in MI or mortality rates between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APS who undergo PCI have worse long-term clinical outcomes, driven by higher rates of revascularization, than other patients undergoing PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study is warranted to examine the mechanisms underlying these findings </plain></SENT>
