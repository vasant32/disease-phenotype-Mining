<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hirudin (1 microM) decreases the intrinsic thrombin activity of the APS IgG by only 25%, whereas it inhibits completely pure thrombin with equivalent activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under conditions, when antithrombin inactivates 60% of the thrombin activity in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG, the APS IgG protects almost completely the added thrombin against inactivation by antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>, however, partially relieves this protective effect and at the same time it facilitates the inhibition of the intrinsic thrombin activity by antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APS IgG reduces the thrombin activity in protein C activation assay by 50% compared to the activity in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> described properties are related to the Fab fragment of the antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IgG preserving the fibrin-generating activity of thrombin with concomitant protection against inhibitors unravels a new aspect of the thrombotic mechanism in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This condition is probably rare: only one out of 23 examined patients with primary or secondary APS expresses IgG with the described properties </plain></SENT>
