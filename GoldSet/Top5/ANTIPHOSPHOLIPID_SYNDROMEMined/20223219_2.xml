<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the LA modules capable of binding beta2GPI-DV interact with the same region on beta2GPI-DV using residues at their calcium-coordination site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structure of a complex between beta2GPI-DV and LA4 of LDLR, solved by molecular docking guided by NMR-derived restraints and extensively validated, represents the general mode of interaction between beta2GPI and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have shown that beta2GPI-DV cannot simultaneously bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors and anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, suggesting that the association of beta2GPI/anti-beta2GPI antibody complexes with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> will interfere with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptors' signaling in APS </plain></SENT>
