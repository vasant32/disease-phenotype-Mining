<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there remains a need for diagnostic criteria for routine clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We audited the results of routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) in a cohort of 193 consecutive patients with aPL positivity-based testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-ß(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-1 antibodies (aß(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medium/high-titre aCL/aβ(2)GPI was defined as &gt;99th percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low-titre aCL/aβ(2)GPI positivity (&gt;95(th )&lt; 99(th) percentile) was considered positive for obstetric but not for thrombotic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred of the 145 patients fulfilled both clinical and laboratory criteria for definite APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six women with purely obstetric APS had persistent low-titre aCL and/or aβ(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the inclusion of these patients, 126 of the 145 patients were considered to have APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven out of 126 patients were LA-negative, of whom 12 had aCL only, 37 had aβ(2)GPI only and 18 positive were for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The omission of aCL or aβ(2)GPI testing from investigation of APS would have led to a failure to diagnose APS in 9.5% and 29.4% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that LA, aCL and aβ(2)GPI testing are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> required for the accurate diagnosis of APS and that low-titre antibodies should be included in the diagnosis of obstetric APS </plain></SENT>
