<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between clinical and serological features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ELISA was used for measurement of antibodies (Abs) and TNF-alpha, while IL-6 and sIL-2R were measured by chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAPS patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> showed positive correlation between IgM isotype of anti-annexin A5 antibodies and TNF-alpha (r = 0.894, p = 0.041) and IgM class of anticardiolipin antibodies and sIL-2R (r = 0.900, p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In PAPS with cerebrovascular insults, positive correlation was noticed between TNF-alpha and IgG isotype of anticardiolipin (r = 0.624, p = 0.040) and anti-annexinA5 Abs (r = 0.768, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isotype analysis of antiphospholipid and anti-annexin A5 Abs and investigation of their association with TNF-alpha is important for differentiation of PAPS patients that are prone to further deterioration of arterial and venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
