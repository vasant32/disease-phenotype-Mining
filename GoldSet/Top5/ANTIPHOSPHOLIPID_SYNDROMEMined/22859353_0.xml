<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary prevention in APS may be aimed at decreasing existing elevated aPL levels, or preventing high aPL titers and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) from developing in the first place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown in retrospective studies to decrease aPL titers in laboratory studies, and to decrease <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> risk in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated an association between HCQ use and persistent aPL and/or LAC in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over 21 years old with SLE from an urban tertiary care center who had aPL and LAC measured on at least 2 occasions at least 12 weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined the presence of persistent LAC+ and/or at least 1 aPL ≥ 40 U [immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM] as the main outcome variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 90 patients included in the study, 17 (19%) had persistent LAC+ and/or at least 1 aPL ≥ 40 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HCQ use was associated with significantly lower odds of having persistent LAC+ and/or aPL ≥ 40 U (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05, 0.79, p = 0.02), adjusted for age, ethnicity, and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that HCQ use is associated with lower odds of having persistently positive LAC and/or aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data from this study provide a basis for the design of future prospective studies investigating the role of HCQ in primary and secondary prevention of APS </plain></SENT>
