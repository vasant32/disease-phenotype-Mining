<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested patients with PAPL with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> for specific antiplatelet autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet autoantibodies were detected by means of platelet immunoassays which included MAIPA with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the platelet Gps known to be possible targets for platelet autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> was found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (73%, 11/15 patients) whereas antiplatelet antibody was detected in only one of the 10 control patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies mainly recognized GpIIbIIIa (n = 7), but also CD9 (n = 5), GpIaIIa (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GpIbIX (n = 3) and GpIV (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet-Gp antibodies eluted from the platelet surface had the same reactivity as those found in the original sera from three of the four patients tested, whereas no anticardiolipin activity was found in the platelet eluates, suggesting the absence of cross-reactivity between anticardiolipin and antiplatelet antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MAIPA assay was also performed with F(ab')2 fragments obtained by pepsin digestion of serum IgG from four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same results were obtained with F(ab')2 fragments and the original serum, demonstrating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> specifically bind in vivo to platelet Gps via their F(ab')2 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a link between specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of PAPL </plain></SENT>
