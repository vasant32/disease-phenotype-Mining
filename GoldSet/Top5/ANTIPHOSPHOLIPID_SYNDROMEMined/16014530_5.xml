<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because both diseases may be apparent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), it is important to establish the relationship between these two types of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined whether sera containing IgM and/or IgG aCLAs also react with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> that has been oxidized by conjugation with malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) or by incubation with copper ions (Cu-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results revealed a clear correlation between IgM aCLAs and IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies, and a weak correlation between IgG aCLAs and IgG anti-Cu-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity between both antibodies seemed to be limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because aCLAs are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, only a minor subset of these antibodies may cross-react with oxLDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identification of both antibodies may be relevant for determination of the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
