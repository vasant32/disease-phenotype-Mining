<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown the ability to induce experimental autoimmune conditions (e.g. SLE, APLS, Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>) following active immunization with the pathogenic autoantibody emulsified in adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mice first develop anti-autoantibodies (Ab2: anti-id) and eventually generate anti-anti-autoantibodies (Ab3: anti-anti-id) which carry the same antigen binding characteristic as the autoantibody (Ab1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The appearance of the specific autoantibodies in mice sera was associated with the emergence of the compatible laboratory and with the clinical findings characteristic to the respective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on experimental anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BALB/c mice were immunized with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> monoclonal antibody (MoAb) named CAM and developed elevated serum titres of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Abs accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and a high percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mice were then lethally irradiated and transfused with bone marrow (BM) cells (T cell depleted) from syngeneic naive mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The titres of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were reduced in the recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decrease in titre of autoantibodies was found to be related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of antibody forming cells in vivo, associated with reduced proliferative response of lymph node cells to anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> MoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recipients showed improvement in clinical parameters following syngeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same recipients developed specific unresponsiveness to a second challenge with the anticardiolipin MoAb (CAM), but developed experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> upon immunization with a monoclonal anti-DNA antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloablative immunosuppression combined with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation may induce a state of tolerance to the pathogenic autoantibodies in mice with experimental APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that a similar approach may be useful in treating life-threatening autoimmune syndromes (e.g. catastrophic APLS) in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
