<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is an autoimmune condition characterised by vascular thromboses and/or pregnancy morbidity, and its diagnosis currently requires laboratory evidence for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL are identified using a large number of laboratory procedures based on one of two distinct test processes, namely 'solid' or 'liquid' phase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former include anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies (aB2GPI), while the latter are centred on clot-based tests used to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depending on their clinical presentation, affected individuals might be seen by a variety of clinical specialties including general physicians and general practionners, with a potentially wide variation in the aPL assays requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The current report summarises findings from the '2008 Australasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> survey', a simple 5-step survey that assessed current clinical and laboratory practice in the investigation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The survey was despatched via various clinical and scientific professional bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Responses were received from 130 scientific and clinical personnel, primarily haematology based (94/130; 72%) or immunology based (34/130; 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most respondents (97/130; 75%) ordered or recommended tests for solid phase aPL testing, and most also attempted to grade these tests and their isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most were familiar with aCL and aB2GPI testing, and tended to request primarily IgG and IgM isotypes of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only a small number of respondents requested/recommended IgA isotype testing of these antibodies or the other solid phase aPL assays (e.g., anti-prothrombin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A similar number of respondents (104/130; 80%) also ordered or recommended tests for LA, and most also attempted to grade these tests and their isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some discipline-related biases were also evident, in that 32/34 (94%) of immunology-based respondents identified that they ordered or recommended specific solid phase tests for aPL, whereas only 62/94 (66%) of haematology-based respondents did so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 83/94 (88%) of haematology-based respondents identified that they ordered or recommended specific LA test procedures, whereas only 18/34 (53%) of immunology-based respondents did so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this report represents the first ever attempt to survey a wide range of clinical and scientific personnel regarding ordering and recommending practices for aPL testing, and provides a snapshot of current clinical and laboratory practice for the investigation of APS in Australia and New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most respondents to our survey still consider the immunoglobulin G (IgG) aCL test to be a useful first-line solid phase aPL test, and the dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) assay to be the most useful LA test </plain></SENT>
