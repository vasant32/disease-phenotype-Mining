<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although several tests are used to screen for the presence of LA, none detects <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> its types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The shortening of APT observed when the pre-incubation period is prolonged, proved to be a sensitive test for the presence of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We determined the APTT, performed with a 4 or 15 min preincubation period (APETs and APTT15 respectively), in 22 healthy subjects, 3 commercial positive controls for LA, 16 patients with a previous diagnosis of LA and 54 patients with recurrent fetal loss and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence of LA was established by a positive Staclot-LA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APTTs and APTT15 were 31.5 +/- 4.7 and 28.4 +/- 4.5 seconds respectively in samples from 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The figures in samples with LA, were 71.5 +/- 20.3 s and 58.6 +/- 18 s respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two APTTs performed on an individual sample was defined as the APTT 4-15 and was 2.6 +/- 2.0 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects 2.5 +/- 2.8 in 13 patients anticoagulated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, -10.0 +/- 6.5 in 13 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and 13.2 +/- 4.9 in 15 patients with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The test values for LA patients were significantly higher than those for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For values over 5, the APTT 4-15 had 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient with recurrent fetal loss or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, who was LA positive, the APTT 4-15 was positive with a value of 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This modified TTPA is easy to perform, and provides a reasonably discriminatory value for the presence of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend the TTPA 4-15 to screen for LA </plain></SENT>
