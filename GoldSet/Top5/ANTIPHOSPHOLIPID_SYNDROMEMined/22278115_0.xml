<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) approaches 40% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after 10 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This risk is higher in patients with permanent risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> such as active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, prolonged immobilization from medical diseases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>; in carriers of several thrombophilic abnormalities, including deficiencies of natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>; and in patients with unprovoked presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with permanent risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should receive indefinite anticoagulation, consisting of subtherapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients whose VTE is triggered by major surgery or trauma should be offered three months of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with unprovoked VTE, including carriers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, and those whose thrombotic event is associated with minor risk factors (such as hormonal treatment, minor injuries, long travel) should receive at least three months of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decision as to go on or discontinue anticoagulation after this period should be individually tailored and balanced against the haemorrhagic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-baseline variables, such as the D-dimer determination and the ultrasound assessment of residual <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can help identify those patients in whom anticoagulation can be safely discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a few emerging anti-Xa and anti-IIa compounds seem to induce fewer haemorrhagic complications than conventional anticoagulation, while preserving at least the same effectiveness, they have the potential to open new scenarios for decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation in patients with VTE </plain></SENT>
