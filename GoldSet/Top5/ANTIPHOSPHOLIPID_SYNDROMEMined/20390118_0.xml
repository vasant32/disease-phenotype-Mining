<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples from 380 subjects, enrolled in this study from June 1, 2007 to May 31, 2008, were tested for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta2glycoprotein (abeta2GPI) antibodies using an ELISA method and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) using a series of clotting tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples of the 113 subjects resulting positive at the first testing time were assayed again to confirm antiphospholipid positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aPL positivity was confirmed in 67 out of the 113 subjects (59.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medium-high antibody levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, except IgM aCL, aPL/ELISA had a significantly higher confirmation rate with respect to that in subjects with low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The confirmation rate in the category I antibody patients (multiple positivity) was higher than that in the category II antibody subjects (single positivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA positivity was confirmed only when it was associated to other aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cut-off of 40 GPL produced a confirmation rate equal to that resulting from a 99th percentile cut-off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of aPL positivity made it possible for us to confirm the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in 8 out of the 113 subjects originally resulting positive (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>APS clinical features were vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 4 of these and pregnancy morbidity in the other 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data emphasize aPL positivity confirmation selectivity, and medium-high antibody levels and category I antibodies (multiple positivity) had the best confirmation rates </plain></SENT>
