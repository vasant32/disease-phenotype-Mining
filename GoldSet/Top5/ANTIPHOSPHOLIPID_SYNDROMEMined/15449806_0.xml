<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the duration of the inhibitory effect of a single LDA on platelet aggregation, using the newly developed aggregometry with the laser light scattering method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five healthy volunteers (females between 23 and 30 years old) ingested 81 mg of buffered aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation was measured with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> before the ingestion and at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th day thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the effect of 81 mg of aspirin continues for at least 8 days, which suggested that the intermittent administration of 81 mg of aspirin (a few times a week) might be an alternative way to induce the anti-platelet effect </plain></SENT>
