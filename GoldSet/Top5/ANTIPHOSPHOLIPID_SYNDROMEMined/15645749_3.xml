<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the influence of the hereditary make-up on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in two ethnic groups [Gypsy and white Caucasian Mediterranean (WCM) populations], living in the same geographic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 81 WCM and 25 Gypsy patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 185 healthy unrelated individuals, 105 WC and 80 Gypsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Gypsy population, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SLE occurred at earlier ages than in the other ethnic group (25.9 versus 32.0 years, P = 0.02), and showed lower SLEDAI peak values (4.9 versus 7.0, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of joint, kidney, gastrointestinal and eye involvement was significantly lower in Gypsy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SLE-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> were more frequent in Gypsies than in the majority ethnic group (WCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In WCM patients, DRB1* 1303-DQB1*0301 haplotype was associated with SLE (P = 0.001, Pc = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found SLE to be associated with DR5 (P = 0.006, Pc = 0.05) in the Gypsy population as well as a protective effect of DPB1*0401 when DR5 was not present (P = 0.008, Pc = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found some clinical differences between WCM and Gypsy patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HLA associations between HLA-DRB1-DQB1 and SLE were different for Gypsy people </plain></SENT>
