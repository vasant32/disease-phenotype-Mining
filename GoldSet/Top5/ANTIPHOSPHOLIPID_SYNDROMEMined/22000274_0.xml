<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nature of these complexes is currently better defined, as well as known, the structure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> owing to the analysis of the monoclonal forms of these antibodies which were also studied both in terms of their precise specificities and cross-reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the origin of these autoantibodies is not clearly understood, as well as the possible link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> present in healthy individuals, and those observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a fraction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are pathogenic and directly responsible for the clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, but there is, to date, no biological test able to accurately detect pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
