<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) levels, TAFI gene polymorphisms and Clot Lysis Time (CLT) in pregnant patients with APS in relation to pregnancy outcome and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Group 1 consisted of 67 pregnant patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 2 included 66 pregnant patients with uneventful term pregnancies and delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were sampled during each trimester and at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAFI antigen and CLT and two polymorphisms of the TAFI gene, Ala147Thr and +1542C/G, were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly prolonged CLT was found at baseline in Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allele distribution of the TAFI gene polymorphisms was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basal TAFI and CLT in patients with APS having an adverse or a good obstetrical outcome were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of TAFI and CLT baseline levels in patients with APS with or without previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> showed no statistical differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with APS have impairment in fibrinolysis evidenced by prolonged CLT at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TAFI and CLT do not seem to be useful as markers of obstetric outcome or risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
