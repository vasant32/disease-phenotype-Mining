<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS is characterized by the presense of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, and prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> dependent coagulation such as activated clotting time (ACT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perioperative thrombotic complications are frequent among patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antigen syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these cases, perioperative <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> titration for anticoagulation monitoring is very important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this patient, preoperative coagulation testing revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (APTT) and antithrombin-III (AT-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the operating room, a base line ACT was 124 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We decided to administer a standard protocol heparine dose of 100 IU x kg(-1) of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the artifitial vascular replacement, the ACT was recorded at 249 sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a 75 mg dose of protamine was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this particular case, it is difficult to decided to administer the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When an adequate platelet count, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TT, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AT-III level are shown, it would be decided to use the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> monitoring systems; ACT, circulating <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> concentrations, according to some reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this case, with standard protocol <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, he had no complications in the postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The perioperative management was succeseful </plain></SENT>
