<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IgG from patients suffering in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with thrombotic complications exerts even stronger antifibrinolytic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A patient, whose IgG does not affect the fibrin dissolution with plasmin, displays a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The shear stress-induced disassembly of the fibrin clots containing IgGs with antifibrinolytic potency occurs at a much more advanced stage of fibrin digestion, as evidenced by the electrophoretic pattern of the ureatreated samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antifibrinolytic effects are also produced under static conditions and these are caused by the variable portion of the IgG molecules (fragment Fab), whereas the constant part (fragment Fc) has no inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgGs with antifibrinolytic properties do not affect directly the plasmin activity in amidolytic assay, but the IgGs from APS patients obliterate the competition of the fibrin and the peptidyl-p-nitroanilide for the protease in the same assay system suggesting interference of the IgGs with the plasmin action on the fibrin substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the correlation of the clinical symptoms with the effect of the isolated IgG on the dissolution of perfused fibrin clots supports a physiological and a pathological role of IgG in the fibrinolytic process related to the variability of the cross-reactions of immunoglobulins with fibrin, fibrin degradation products or fibrin-plasmin complexes </plain></SENT>
