<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain their pathogenic effects and among them, we have previously shown that APLA accumulate in late endosomes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) leading to a redistribution of the <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17369">mannose-6-phosphate</z:chebi> receptor (CI-M6PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because many APLA are directed towards beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta2GP1)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> complexes, we investigated the localisation of beta2GP1 in HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By immunofluorescence analysis, using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-beta2GP1 antibodies, we detected beta2GP1 at the cell surface and in late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of HUVEC with anti-beta2GP1 antibodies resulted in antibody accumulation at the cell surface and within late endosomes and in a redistribution of the CI-M6PR from the Golgi apparatus to late endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-beta2GP1 antibodies remained detectable in late endosomes even after several days of incubation in antibody-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of anti-beta2GP1 antibodies in late endosomes of endothelial cells and the resulting modification of intracellular protein trafficking may contribute to the pathogenic effects of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
