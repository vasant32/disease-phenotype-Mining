<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(4) The evaluation of the correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries and selected systemic complications in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a group of 103 SLE patients and 30 healthy people (control group) was performed B-mode ultrasound examination of carotid arteries, using <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi> 3500 (ATL) with linear transducer 5-12 MHz to evaluate the presence of atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were evaluated traditional risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, selected autoantibodies and markers of inflammatory reaction, selected genes polymorphism and applied treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with chi2 Yates, chi2 Pearson and R rank Spearman tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis was also done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thickened <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and carotid plaques are significantly more frequent in SLE patients in comparison with the control group (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0035 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among traditional risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, male gender and age above 45 years were significantly associated with the presence of atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main autoantibodies, which were significantly associated with the risk of the presence of atherosclerotic disorders were as follows: antiprothrombin antibodies (aPTR) in IgA class (OR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.1-30.2), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>) directed against elastase (OR = 14.7; 95% CI: 1.4-38.0) and cathepsin G (OR = 10.8; 95% CI: 1.1-126.3) and anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) (OR = 6.6; 95% CI: 1.6-28.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed, that high cumulated dose of glucocorticosteroids is significantly associated with increased risk of development of atherosclerotic changes (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The thickening of intima-media and the presence of carotid plaques are significantly more frequent in patients with SLE in comparison with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are risk factors for thickening of intima-media and carotid plaques development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(3) The risk factors of thickening intima-media and carotid plaques development in patients with SLE are selected autoantibodies, inflammatory process and applied treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(4) Traditional risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are not the leading cause of thickened intimamedia and carotid plaques development in patients with SLE contrary to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>(5) Measurement of intima-media thickness might be useful in the evaluation of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and risk of its complications in patients with SLE in routine diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>(6) Thickening of intima-media and the presence of carotid plaques in patients with SLE are associated with significant risk of severe systemic complications, mainly related to cardiovascular and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
