<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate microcirculatory changes (functional and morphological) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients were examined using nailfold videocapillaroscopy (18 PAPS patients and 13 healthy subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into two subgroups, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (n = 8) and with anticardiolipin (n = 10) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> was determined; diameters ( micro m) and functional capillary density (FCD, number capillaries/mm2) were measured in control conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity (CBFV, mm/s) was also evaluated at rest and after release of 60 s <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with at least one morphological alteration in the observed capillaries was 77.8% for patients and 21.3% for healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Capillary diameters ( microm) [afferent (AD), apical (APD) and efferent (ED)] were significantly smaller (mean +/- s.d.: AD-PAPS, 7.4 +/- 2.1; control, 9.1 +/- 2.6, P = 0.063; APD-PAPS, 11.6 +/- 2.3; control, 14.4 +/- 3.8, P = 0.015; ED-PAPS, 8.4 +/- 2.0; control, 10.9 +/- 3.2, P = 0.011) in PAPS patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FCD (PAPS, 8.5 +/- 3.2; control, 8.3 +/- 2.9, P +/- 0.862), mean resting CBFV (PAPS, 0.73 +/- 0.31; control, 0.88 +/- 0.41, P = 0.278), mean peak CBFV after occlusion (PAPS, 1.07 +/- 0.52; control, 1.59 +/- 0.91, P = 0.063) and mean time (s) to reach it (PAPS, 5.2 +/- 1.7; control, 4.6 +/- 1.8, P = 0.101) were not statistically different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that nailfold capillary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is altered in patients with PAPS, but these changes could not be correlated to impairment of functional parameters </plain></SENT>
