<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, acquired and congenital risk factors, treatment strategies, and long-term outcome in pediatric pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (PTE) cases followed in our center in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Of the total 470 pediatric patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> referred to our center, 16 (3.4%) had PTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the children with PTE was 10.3 +/- 6.8 years (range: 1.5-20.0, median: 10.5), and 12 (75.0%) were boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 28.9 +/- 21.0 months (range: 3-66, median: 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, recurrence was observed in three children (18.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time from the appearance of symptoms to accurate diagnosis was 6.4 +/- 4.0 days (range: 2-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (37.5%) were initially diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After they were hospitalized and showed no clinical improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, the accurate diagnosis of PTE was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 16 patients with PTE, 8 (50%) had associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 6 (37.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003095'>septic arthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> (n = 1), and infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (n = 2) were detected in our patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, two patients had a central venous line and one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other underlying diseases included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Factor V G1691A heterozygous mutation was detected in two children, and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T homozygous mutation was detected in one child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A high level of factor VIII was the most common (8/16, 50%) laboratory risk factor in our patient group, and 12 children (75.0%) had a high D-dimer level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among 16 children with PTE, one child had one, three children had two, five children had three, three children had four, and four children had five laboratory and/or clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with PTE had at least one laboratory and/or clinical risk factor that facilitated development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, according to the risk assessment for persistence or recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in children conducted by Manco-Johnson, 12 children (75%) with PTE in the present study had high-risk criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When a child with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at any site of the body develops unexpected respiratory symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> unresponsive to antibiotic treatment, imaging studies should be performed for diagnosis of PTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, thrombotic children with high-risk criteria should be followed closely for the development of PTE </plain></SENT>
