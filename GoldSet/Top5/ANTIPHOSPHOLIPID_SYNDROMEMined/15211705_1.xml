<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the different aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also describe experimental models that help to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of the effects of this maternal disease on the developing embryo, fetus and placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The possible direct effects of sera or IgG obtained from women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (SLE/APS) and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) were examined on cultured 10.5- and 11.5-day-old rat embryos and on cultured human placental explants, as compared to sera from healthy women or synthetic medium that were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined the effects of the sera obtained from these women after successful treatment that allowed the birth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed increased embryonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and anomalies in embryos cultured on sera and IgG from SLE/APS women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, when human placental explants were cultured on these sera, trophoblastic cell growth was reduced and apoptotic rate was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment also reduced the damage caused by the sera from these women in the cultured embryos and placentas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results, and the cited studies, point to the important role of the placental damage in the etiology of RPL associated with SLE/APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Animal models, both in vivo and in vitro, as well as cultured early human placental explants can be used successfully to understand some of the pathogenic aspects of SLE/APS and RPL </plain></SENT>
