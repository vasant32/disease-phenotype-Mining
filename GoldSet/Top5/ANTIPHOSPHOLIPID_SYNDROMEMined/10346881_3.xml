<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimotopes have been discovered which compete with beta2GPI for binding to selected anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-containing linker was attached to the N-terminus of two cyclic thioether <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimotopes, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> 1a and 1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, with linker attached, were reacted with two different haloacetylated platforms to prepare four tetravalent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-platform conjugates to be tested as B cell toleragens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The linker-containing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were reacted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16072">maleimide</z:chebi>-derivatized keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to provide <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-KLH conjugates </plain></SENT>
