<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These factors may lead to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> vascular changes observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the presented study was to evaluate anticardiolipin autoantibodies (ACA) and anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (antibodies against oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) levels in the plasma immunoglobulin IgG class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 90 OHT patients (79 men/11 women, age 44 +/- 13); 35 individuals were chosen as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken twice, in years 2002 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigated group was divided into 2 smaller groups: OHT patients in 2002 and OHT patients before 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OHT patients showed significantly higher ACA concentrations compared with the control group (3.53 vs 1.10 GPL U/mL), whereas anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels did not differ considerably (494 vs 385 mU/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During long-term observation the significant increase in ACA concentration was observed in both patients groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the 2 OHT patient groups regarding anti-ox-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> concentration were demonstrated among samples taken in 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results may indicate the possible role of autoimmunological processes in OHT development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to focus further research on the possibilities of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
