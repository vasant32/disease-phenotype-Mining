<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most evidence suggests that phosphodiester-linked phosphate groups are the reactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) in binding to aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little attention has been given to the acyl moiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this problem we have evaluated the ELISA binding of 12 highly positive IgG anticardiolipin antibody-positive SLE sera to: bovine CL (86.1% 18:2n-6), monolyso CL (MLCL; bovine CL minus 1 fatty acid), dilyso CL (DLCL; minus 2 fatty acids), tetraoleoyl CL (TOCL), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">myristoyl</z:chebi> CL (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>) and E. coli CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reductions in binding of the IgG aPL antibodies relative to bovine CL were as follows: DLCL 83%; MLCL 70.7%; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e> 58%; and TOCL 14% (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the number of acyl chains and the unsaturation of the acyl chain of CL may be important determinants in the binding to aPL present in SLE sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the nutritional relevance of this finding, we examined the incorporation of several dietary fatty acid classes into the CL pool of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice were fed diets containing n-6 (safflower oil), n-9 (olive oil) or n-3 fatty acids as either 18:3n-3 (linseed oil) or 20:5n-3/22:6n-3 (fish oil) for a 5 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The feeding of fish oil and olive oil resulted in replacement of a substantial portion of 18:2n-6 with 22:6n-3 or 18:1n-9, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there may be therapeutic value in modifying the CL acyl composition by nutritional means with respect to binding to pathogenic aPL </plain></SENT>
