<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Antiphospholipid (a-PL) antibodies, especially IgG isotype, have been associated with a variety of neurological manifestations related to thrombotic mechanism and reactivity against <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high titre of a-PL antibodies has been also correlated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (CTEPH) and, therefore, is frequently reported in patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of a-PL antibodies in postoperative outcome following PEA, however, has not been clearly evaluated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we investigated the impact of a high a-PL IgG titre (HAPT) on postoperative outcome following PEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 1994 to October 2008, out of 204 patients undergoing PEA at our centre, 184 were prospectively screened for a-PL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the preoperative IgG titre, patients were divided into two groups: Group A (high a-PL antibodies titre - HAPT) with a-PL IgG titre &gt;10 U/ml and Group B (low a-PL antibodies titre - LAPT) with a-PL IgG titre &lt;or=10 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early outcomes were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (15%) were included in Group A, whereas 156 (85%) patients were included in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HAPT influenced preoperative parameters as patients of Group A were younger compared to those of Group B (42+/-16 and 52+/-16 for Group A and B, respectively, P=0.001) and presented more frequently a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) (96% and 62% for Group A and B, respectively, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two groups were homogeneous for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other operative parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As far as postoperative outcome, in terms of mortality and major complications, there were no differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of transient neurological complications, however, was significantly different (32% and 10% for Group A and B, respectively, P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of high titre of IgG isotype a-PL antibodies significantly influences preoperative characteristics of patients undergoing PEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite that no significant differences were shown in major end points, the presence of high titre of a-PL did interfere with postoperative course as caused by an increased rate of minor and transient neurological impairment (TNI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An accurate monitoring especially during hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (CA) period seems, therefore, mandatory in this subgroup of patients undergoing PEA </plain></SENT>
