<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are the first results of patients enrolled in Serbian National Cohort Study which comprises 256 patients: 162 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and 94 with APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was similar prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in PAPS and SLE groups (34.6% and 34%, respectively, p = 0.932) although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was more frequent in PAPS (25.9% and 8.5%, respectively, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was observed in 92 (55.8%) patients who had more than one type of antibody (category I), in 13 (41.9%) patients with category IIa, in 19 (46.3%) patients with category IIb, and in 73 (44.2%) patients with category IIc (p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were older than those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (49.8 and 39.8 years, respectively, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
