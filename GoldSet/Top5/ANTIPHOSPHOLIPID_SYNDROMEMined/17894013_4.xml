<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence and properties of ASCA in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one out of 155 APS patients tested positive for ASCA (20.0%), compared to 5.0% in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of ASCA was not associated with any specific manifestation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ASCA found to be the population of anti-beta2GPI antibodies (Abs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anti-beta2GPI from ASCA-positive sera on a beta2GPI column, bound specifically the PPM, as shown by direct binding and competition assays (95-98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PPM inhibited differentially the anti-beta2GPI binding to beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the anti-beta2GPI anti-PPM could bind only native form of beta2GPI and not the recombinant form, we assume that these specific anti-beta2GPI subpopulations of Abs are directed to the glycosylated site of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a subpopulation of anti-beta2GPI is specific to the glycosylated site of the beta2GPI molecule that cross-reacts with PPM </plain></SENT>
