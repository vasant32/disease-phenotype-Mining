<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that altering specific Arg residues in the H chain of a human pathogenic beta2GPI-dependent aPL, IS4, has major effects on its ability to bind these clinically important Ags </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We expressed whole human IgG in vitro by stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with expression plasmids containing different V(H) and V(L) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>V(H) sequences were derived from IS4 by altering the number of Arg residues in CDR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>V(L) sequences were those of IS4, B3 (anti-nucleosome Ab), and UK4 (beta2GPI-independent aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of the expressed H/L chain combinations to a range of anionic, neutral, and zwitterionic PL, as well as prothrombin, beta2GPI, dsDNA, and chicken OVA, was determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of four Arg residues in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to Ser, two at positions 100 and 100g, reduced binding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ags, while two at positions 96 and 97 reduced binding to beta2GPI but increased or decreased binding to different PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 14 H/L chain combinations displayed weak binding to OVA with Arg to Ser replacements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four Arg residues enhancing binding to this Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one H/L chain combination bound neutral PL and none bound dsDNA; hence, these effects are particularly relevant to Ags important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that these four Arg residues have developed as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> driven by an Ag containing both PL and beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
