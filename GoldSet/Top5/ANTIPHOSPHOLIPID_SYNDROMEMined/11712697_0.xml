<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> is highly complex, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to make assumptions about the functional roles and diagnostic significance of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter is mainly due to the fact that results from different assay systems are not interchangeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A laboratory "gold standard" which helps the clinician to differentiate irrelevant autoimmune phenomena from significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> at an early stage, is clearly missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To meet this challenge, a rheuma entrance screening (RES) assay toolbox is proposed based on fully-automated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology on one system for the clinical and routine laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RES concept is intended to cover the most important syndromes of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235910" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagenosis</z:e>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serological part of diagnosis of these diseases comprises testing for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), low levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and disease-specific anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, e.g. anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I (anti-beta2 GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To eliminate the known problems of varying assay systems in this field, a novel, objective, rapid and reproducible approach to screen for such analytes in patient serum or plasma more efficiently is the application of EIAs on the fully-automated immunoassay analyser COBAS CORE (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combined use of the RES (COBAS CORE HEp2 ANA EIA, COBAS CORE RF EIA Quant, COBAS CORE CRP EIA Quant and COBAS CORE Anti-beta2 GPI EIA) is intended for patients sent to the laboratory with the primary suspicion of harbouring a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
