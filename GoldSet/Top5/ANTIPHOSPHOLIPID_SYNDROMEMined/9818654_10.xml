<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 65 SLE patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with positive IgG and/or IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups; I: 29 SLE patients with features of APS (SLE/APS) and II: 36 aCL positive SLE patients without any feature of APS (SLE/aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were collected from our serum bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) were tested by ELISA using irradiated plates in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-dsDNA antibodies were tested by standard Farr assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no major differences between SLE clinical manifestations in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency of IgG anti-beta2-GPI was markedly increased in SLE/APS (18/29, 62%) than in SLE/aCL (4/36, 11%) (chi-squared 18.6, p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the same samples were slightly lower in SLE/APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003237'>increased levels of IgG</z:hpo> anti-beta2-GPI may be a specific feature of SLE/APS patients rather than reflecting a polyclonal B cell activation </plain></SENT>
