<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the impact and quality of the research presented in the Israel Society of Rheumatology (ISR) annual scientific meetings by measuring publication rates of the abstracts in peer-reviewed journals and investigating the factors that influenced publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 79 abstracts submitted to the ISR for the 1998-2000 annual meetings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A MEDLINE search of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abstracts, by authors, topics and keywords was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Senior authors of abstracts not found to be published in this search were interviewed regarding publication and factors influencing submission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We described the effect of variable factors on the rate of publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As of September 2002, 63 (80%) abstracts were published in peer-reviewed journals or are currently in-press </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most abstracts were published in prominent journals (with a high impact factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the abstracts (61%) were published in rheumatologic journals, 65% of the studies originated from tertiary centers and 19% of the studies were multicenter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common diseases studied were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (20%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (19%) and inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the studies were of disease pathogenesis (35%) and clinical manifestations (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common study designs were basic science (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An overall 57% of the studies reported "positive" results and 9% reported "negative" results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the factors studied were associated with publication or non-publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The main cause cited by authors for not publishing their abstract was lack of time to prepare a full paper or a desire to further expand the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Within this group of 16 authors of abstracts, 11 authors still plan to submit a paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ISR annual meetings have an important clinical scientific impact as measured by the high rate of abstracts published as full length articles in leading peer-reviewed journals </plain></SENT>
