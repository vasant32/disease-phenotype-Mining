<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been reports of abnormalities in the antigenic levels or activity of endothelium-derived haemostatic factors, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1); however the data from these studies are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied plasma from nine patients with APS; seven of them had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied nine matched control patients who had SLE without APS, and 14 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured t-PA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) and anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) levels by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), PAI-1 activity by a parabolic-rate chromogenic assay, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity by a standard mixing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For t-PA and PAI-1, measurements were made on morning and evening plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups of patients did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most APS patients (7/9) but none of the controls were taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Between the APS and the control patients no significant differences were detected in t-PA, PAI-1, vWF or AECA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When APS patients were considered alone, vWF levels correlated positively with IgG ACA levels (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.01) and negatively with platelet count (r = -0.68, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between levels of ACA or LA activity and t-PA, PAI-1 or AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy volunteers, the diurnal variation of t-PA and PAI-1 was blunted in the two patient groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
