<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Laboratory tests have an important role in rheumatology for evaluation, diagnosis and follow up in several diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specialized tests such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA), anti single or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi> antibodies (anti DNA) and anticardiolipin antibodies (AcACL) are frequently used and its diagnostic performance is well known in tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our setting is a secondary care center that implemented these tests two years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After one year of implementation, we decided to evaluate the frequency of use, who orders these tests, and their diagnostic properties for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENST AND METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with clinical charts and a request for these tests were evaluated from September 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These evaluations were done prospectively by a single, trained evaluator following a standardized format looking at pretest clinical information such as pretest diagnosis, physician's level of training, service and posttest results as well as therapeutic changes after results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis: descriptive statistics and 2 by 2 tables to estimate diagnostic performance of most common indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty six requests were reviewed and only 157 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rheumatology and Internal Medicine services sent 63 and 31 requests for these tests respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic properties of ANA for SLE were sensitivity (sen) 70%, specificity (spec): 92%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>): 81%, negative predictive value (<z:chebi fb="33" ids="7468">NPP</z:chebi>): 86%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR): 8.73 and negative likelihood ratio (NLR): 0.33 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi> Sen: 78%, spec: 50%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>: 80%, <z:chebi fb="33" ids="7468">NPP</z:chebi>: 46%, PLR: 1.56, NLR: 0.44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ACACL Sen: 78% spec: 92%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>: 78%, NPV 92%, PLR: 10, NLR 0.24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These specialized tests are not frequently used in our setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Their diagnostic properties are not as accurate as those published in medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Guidelines are needed in our hospital to improve their diagnostic performance </plain></SENT>
