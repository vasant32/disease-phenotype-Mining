<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown a cross-reaction between anticardiolipin and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) antibodies in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate the existence of a cross-reaction between anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2-GP-I) and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies in a group of APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three patients with APS were included in the study; 47 of these patients were diagnosed as primary APS, while the rest (46 patients) fulfilled criteria for the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were positive for the IgG isotype of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve (26%) SLE-associated APS and 14 (29.7%) primary APS patients had raised concentrations of IgG antibodies to oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between anti-beta2-GP-I and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition experiments showed no cross-reaction either between anti-beta2-GP-I and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies, or between anti-beta2-GP-I and anti-native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the presence of both anti-beta2-GP-I and anti-oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> antibodies in patients with APS is not due to the structural similarity and consequent cross-reaction, and that they are two different populations of antibodies directed against different antigens </plain></SENT>
