<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2glycoprotein I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies constitute the main autoantibody specificity in the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that anti-beta2GPI antibodies induce the precoagulant activity of the endothelium by cross-linking the beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since beta2GPI lacks intracellular domains, homology with other molecules such as CD40 that could initiate signaling, was extensively searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 86% homology between the amino acid position 239-245 of the CD40 and 7-13 of the beta2glycoprotein was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to amino acids 239-245 of the CD40 molecule was synthesized and coupled to a multiple antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were found in 61.5% APS patients (n = 39), in 72.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) positive for anti-beta2GPI antibodies (n = 11) and 31.6% of SLE negative for anti-beta2GPI antibodies (n = 19), but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients (n = 28) or controls (n = 36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and/or brain microinfarcts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anti-CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antibodies as well as affinity purified anti-beta2GPI antibodies recognized both, the beta2GPI and the CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity of this recognition was confirmed with homologous and heterologous inhibition experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated this cross-recognition of CD40 and beta2GPI molecules, by the purified anti-CD40 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antibodies, at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, antibodies reacting with the beta2GPI can react and potentially activate different cells which express CD40 molecules at their surface </plain></SENT>
