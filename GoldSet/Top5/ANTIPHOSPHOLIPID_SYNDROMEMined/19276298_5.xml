<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort from the Department of Rheumatology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden, consisting of 166 unrelated SLE patients was investigated as well as 190 unrelated healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age at SLE diagnosis was 39 years (range 10-83) and mean follow-up time was 16 years (range 1-44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 87% women among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients, and the control group consisted of 98 women and 92 men from the same geographical area and with a similar age and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA SNP nt16189C was associated with SLE (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.04-3.78, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, SNP nt13708A was associated with SLE in males (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.08-11.1, P = 0.04), although the number of male patients was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SNP nt10398A was associated with secondary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (P = 0.017, OR 8.2, 95% CI 1.1-63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this study, we have for the first time investigated the possible association between SLE disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these novel results suggest that mtDNA polymorphisms may be associated with development of SLE and may potentially be of importance in SLE pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
