<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> due to SLE whose condition was refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> were treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (0.5 to 1.0 g/m2) monthly for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had bilateral eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>One eye</z:mp> was legally blind, and 13 eyes could see only hand movements or count fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had evidence of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery in visual acuity occurred in 10 eyes (50%), and a partial response occurred in six eyes (30%); four eyes (20%) had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete response in the field tests occurred in eight eyes (40%), with a partial response in nine eyes (45%); no improvement occurred in three eyes (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> pulse therapy seems to be an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A randomized controlled trial will be necessary to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
