<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiac-NL children (N=50) and controls (N=151) were drawn from the following overlapping pregnancy studies: Research Registry for NL; PR Interval and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> Evaluation in Cardiac-NL; and Predictors of Pregnancy Outcomes: Biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies met the following inclusion criteria: documentation of maternal anti-SSA/Ro/SSB/La antibodies at pregnancy, confirmation of medication use and child's outcome, a diagnosis of SLE before pregnancy and birth by 31 December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (14%) of the cardiac-NL children were exposed to HCQ compared with 56 (37%) of the controls (p=0.002; OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were similar with respect to demographic and antibody status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis adjusting for birth year, maternal race/ethnicity, antibody status, non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50830">fluorinated steroid</z:chebi> use and prior cardiac-NL risk yielded an OR associated with HCQ use of 0.46 (95% CI 0.18 to 1.18; p=0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case-control study suggests that, in mothers with SLE with anti-SSA/Ro/SSB/La antibodies, exposure to HCQ during pregnancy may decrease the risk of fetal development of cardiac-NL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are needed for confirmation </plain></SENT>
