<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical, laboratory and outcome features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans syndrome</z:e> (ES) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 953 SLE patients followed up regularly at our service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ES was defined as the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> concomitantly or sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory manifestations occurring during the disease course, as well as concomitant diseases and survival was carefully reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified ES in 26 of 953 (2.7%) SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three were women with mean age at SLE diagnosis of 25.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (15%) patients had disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before the age of 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the majority of patients (92%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and AIHA appeared simultaneously at the beginning of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Active features of SLE were a frequent finding concomitant to ES, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (77%), malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (61.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>photosensitivity</z:hpo> (57.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (34.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> (73%), serositis (54%), neuropsychiatric (19%) and pulmonary (15%) manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to this multisystemic disease, 34.6% of our patients had an association with another <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of ES was observed in only four (15%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After follow-up time of 8.72 years, 19 patients (73%) were in remission and seven (27%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: ES is a rare manifestation in SLE, occurring in patients with severe multisystemic SLE manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies frequently used in SLE contribute to longer disease remission and less frequent exacerbation than observed in the general population with ES </plain></SENT>
