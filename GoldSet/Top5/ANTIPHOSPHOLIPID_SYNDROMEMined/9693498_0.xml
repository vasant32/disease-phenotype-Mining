<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 27 of 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> (33 females, 14 males age 40 years) enzyme immunoassay has detected IgG-antibodies to prothrombin (aPT)--one of cofactor proteins responsible for binding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other aPL were also found: antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) in 14 and 27 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>37 (79%) patients had at least one of the studied aPL suggesting that such patients belong to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A correlation exists between aPT and LA: LA is detectable in 67% of aPT-positive patients compared to 45% of aPT-negative patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the fact that prothrombin is a cofactor for most aPL registered as LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of two subgroups of aPL patients different by dominant antigenic specificity (18 patients with aPT but free of ACL and 6 patients with aCP but free of aPT) demonstrated that the latter developed disorders of cerebral circulation, head ache, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and renal syndrome less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>aPT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> seems to be a marker of comparatively low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and less severe course of the disease </plain></SENT>
