<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop and validate a risk score [global APS score (GAPSS)] derived from the combination of independent risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy loss (PL), taking into account the aPL profile, conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and the autoimmune antibody profile.Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study included 211 consecutive SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on clinical manifestations, conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, aPL profile, ANAs, ENA and anti-dsDNA were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term low-dose aspirin, oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and HCQ treatment were also included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly divided into two sets by a computer-generated randomized list </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed GAPSS in the first set of patients (n = 106), assigning the risk factors identified by multivariate analysis weighted points proportional to the Î²-regression coefficient values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GAPSS was validated in the second set of patients (n = 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship between GAPPS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or PL was analysed.Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the first set, higher values of GAPSS were seen in patients who experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or PL compared with those without clinical events [GAPSS 9.3 (4.8) (range 1-19) and 5.3 (4) (range 0-16), P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also taken separately, patients who experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or PL showed higher GAPSS compared with those without clinical events [GAPSS 9.6 (4.8) (range 1-19) vs 4.9 (5) (range 0-14), P = 0.027 for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; 7.3 (5) vs 3.9 (5.1) (range 0-16), P = 0.024 for PL, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the second set, the results were similar, with statistically higher values of GAPSS in patients with a clinical history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or PL compared with those without events [GAPSS 9.5 (5.6) (range 0-20) and 3.9 (4.1) (range 0-17), P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher values were also seen when subclassifying the patients according to the clinical manifestation, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or PL [GAPSS 9.5 (5.6) (range 0-20) vs 4.8 (5.4) (range 0-17), P = 0.036 for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; 7.9 (3.3) vs 3.8 (5.4) (range 0-16), P = 0.037 for PL, respectively).Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data propose a substantial improvement in risk prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or PL in SLE based on assessment of the GAPSS, a quantitative scoring system </plain></SENT>
