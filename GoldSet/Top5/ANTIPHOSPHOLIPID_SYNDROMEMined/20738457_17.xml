<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies reacting with human neutrophil elastase (HNE) have been reported to distinguish the cocaine-related syndrome from a true autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Published cases of retiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> related to cocaine use are rare and an etiologic role for levamisole, a common adulterant of cocaine, has been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe two female patients aged 39 and 49 years with cocaine-related retiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, mainly affecting the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical and serological profile in case 1 led to a suspicion of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and in case 2 to Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> with an unexplained associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies revealed a mixed pattern of leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in case 1 and pure microvascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identification of anti-HNE antibodies in both patients linked their disease to cocaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mixed vasculopathic pattern in case 1 and the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in case 2, both known adverse effects of levamisole, point to this as the true etiologic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urine toxicology shortly after a binge of cocaine use in each case was positive for levamisole </plain></SENT>
