<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of aPL-mediated pregnancy failure have been researched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that aPL bind trophoblast cells, reducing proliferation, human chorionic gonadotrophin release, and in vitro invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that aPL are also able to react with human decidual cells, inducing a proinflammatory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decidua, a newly formed tissue on the maternal side of the human placenta, is characterized by active <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and structural modifications of the spiral arteries in early pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is a critical component of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> placentation, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of aPL on human endometrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we investigated the effect of aPL on in vitro endometrial endothelial cell (HEEC) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, VEGF secretion by ELISA, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity by gelatin zymography, and DNA binding activity of NFKB by a sensitive multiwell colorimetric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we performed experiments to study whether aPL affects in vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in a murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that aPL significantly decrease the number and the total length of the tubules formed by HEEC on in vitro Matrigel assay and reduce newly formed vessels in aPL-inoculated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aPL reduce significantly both VEGF and MMPs production and, at the nuclear level, NFKB DNA binding activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From our results, it appears that aPL are associated with an inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, suggesting further additional mechanisms to explain the defective placentation in the APS </plain></SENT>
