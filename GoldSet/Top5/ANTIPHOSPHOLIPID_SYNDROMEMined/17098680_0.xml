<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of serum antibodies are collectively termed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and is the hallmark of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interest in the pathogenesis has mostly been focused on the blood coagulation factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, endothelial cells might play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When stimulated, cell membrane would flip to expose negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and activation markers such as adhesive molecules may appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We consider that these changes may play an important role in the initiation of the thrombotic process when endothelial cells encounter a PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, we incubated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with IgG isolated from patients with APS and found that the HUVECs were activated by the expression of negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, as shown by high annexin V binding and negative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> staining and by an increase in the level of intracellular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above findings indicate that endothelial cells can be activated on exposure to aPL and trigger the thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
