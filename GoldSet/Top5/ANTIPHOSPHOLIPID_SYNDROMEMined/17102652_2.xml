<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Asserachrom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> line (Diagnostica Stago) with a monoclonal based standardisation, was evaluated in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) positive (n = 138) and a LAC negative (n = 134) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ELISA line consists of the Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> Screen, the Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> IgG,M and the Asserachrom anti-beta(2)GPI IgG and IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-prothrombin antibodies (APT), not being included in the updated laboratory criteria, have been tested by the Asserachrom anti-prothrombin IgG,M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imprecision characteristics showed coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 4.9% to 13.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cut-off values were calculated with the 99 percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> Screen showed 1,5% false positive and 0,7% false negative results in correlation with the Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> IgG,M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>14.7% of the patients were positive for beta2GPI antibodies, 30,0% of them showed a negative Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> Screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta(2)GPI antibodies may be the only test positive in a minority of patients, so the Asserachrom <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> Screen and the Asserachrom anti-beta(2)GPI IgG and IgM should be performed in parallel when APS is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LAC and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> assays, however, remain essential in the laboratory diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
