<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, overexpression of A2 by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cells is associated with excessive fibrinolysis and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, whereas anti-A2 autoantibodies appear to accentuate the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete deficiency of A2 in mice leads to a lack of tPA cofactor activity, accumulation of intravascular fibrin, and failure to clear arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the endothelial cell, p11 is required for Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of A2, which signals translocation of both proteins to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that p11 is expressed at very low levels in the absence of A2 both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate further that unpartnered p11 becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A2 stabilizes intracellular p11 through direct binding, thus masking an autonomous p11 polyubiquitination signal that triggers proteasomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This interaction requires both the p11-binding N-terminal domain of A2 and the C-terminal domain of p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mechanism prevents accumulation of free p11 in the endothelial cell and suggests that regulation of tPA-dependent cell surface fibrinolytic activity is precisely tuned to the intracellular level of p11 </plain></SENT>
