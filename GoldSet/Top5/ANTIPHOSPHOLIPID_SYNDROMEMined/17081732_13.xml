<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from APS (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) patients and from cardiovascular patients exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atherosclerotic syndromes were analyzed for IgG and IgA antibodies in both anti-beta2-GPI and anticardiolipin (aCL) ELISA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the APS samples used here were positive in both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 382 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> patients were also analyzed for IgG and IgA antibodies in the same assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast to the APS samples, we found that only 1% of the samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> patients were positive for IgA aCL, and 1.6% positive for IgG aCL, whereas 35.6% were positive for IgA anti-beta2-GPI and only 1.6% for IgG anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antigenic specificity of 29 serum samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> patients was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six different recombinant domain-deleted mutants (DM) of human beta2-GPI and full-length human beta2-GPI (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) were used in competitive inhibition assays to inhibit the autoantibodies from binding in the anti-beta2-GPI ELISA assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Domain-deleted mutants D--345 and D--45 inhibited the binding in the IgA anti-beta2-GPI assay, suggesting that these autoantibodies recognize domain 4 of the beta2-GPI molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results clearly show that IgA anti-beta2-GPI autoantibodies from atherosclerotic patients are distinct from IgA autoantibodies found in APS samples </plain></SENT>
