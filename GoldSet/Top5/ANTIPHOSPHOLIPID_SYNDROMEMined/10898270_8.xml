<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, about 7% are caused by chromosome defects, 15% to hormonal defects, and 10% to 15% to anatomical defects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the past 4 years, 179 patients, prescreened for chromosomal, hormonal, and anatomical defects, and found to harbor none, underwent hemostasis defect evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 160 of these have been analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A hemostasis defect was found in 150 of 160 women (n = 94% of screened women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 33 years; the mean number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> before referral was three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women with a procoagulant defect (149) were treated with preconception <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> at 81 mg/d, and unfractionated porcine <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> at 5000 U every 12 hours was added immediately postconception; both agents were used to term delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two of 149 patients failed therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients should be screened by an obstetrician or by reproductive specialists for hormonal and anatomic defects before initiating a procoagulant evaluation; if such prescreening is done, the yield of a defect is high and appropriate therapy leads to an excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
