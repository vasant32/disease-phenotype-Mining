<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 36 patients, 18 with a diagnosis of PAPS and 18 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a two-phase (rest-stress) (13)N-ammonia PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial perfusion images were acquired and then analysed by two experts in the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> in 7/18 asymptomatic PAPS patients (38.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anterolateral wall was the most commonly affected cardiac territory [5/7 PAPS patients (71.4%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a severity analysis, we found that five patients (71.4%) had mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, one patient (14.2%) had moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and another one (14.2%) had severe defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the healthy volunteers studied showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardial perfusion images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An important proportion of PAPS patients, even when asymptomatic, showed myocardial perfusion defects assessed with PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the ischaemic patients had mild defects and the anterolateral wall was the territory mainly affected </plain></SENT>
