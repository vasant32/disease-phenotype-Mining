<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 8 patients with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (PAPS) and 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparison group was formed by 17 patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> without anticardiolipin IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified the 80-100, 130-150 and 150-170 KD surface proteins that comigrate with GPIIIa, GPIIb and GPIb and a 50-70 KD cytoplasm band by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, the prevalence of the antiplatelet antibodies against GPIIIa was 53% on immunoblot assay and 47% on MAIPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients who had also anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies in serum, the percentage of reactivity to GPIIIa declined to 37% on immunoblot and 21% on MAIPA but it was not statistically different from the percentage observed in patients with classical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies to platelet surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> were almost absent in SLE and PAPS patients, who showed a significant prevalence (78%) of IgG reactivity to the 50-70 KD internal platelet protein which was frequently encountered also in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and aPL (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study provides additional evidence that platelet antigens in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-associated secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are different from those of primary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, and that surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> were not involved </plain></SENT>
