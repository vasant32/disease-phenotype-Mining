<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a study about the treatment of these pregnant women with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> at low doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have followed-up a group of 28 women with previous abortions and positive aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were treated with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (50 mg/day) since beginning until end of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured aCL levels monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 cases of pregnancy (86%) were successfully, 3 cases were fetal losses and 1 case was a fetal malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL were positive in 16 patients before treatment, and IgM aCL in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
