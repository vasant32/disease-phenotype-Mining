<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and autoimmune mice have IgM natural autoantibodies to bromelain-treated erythrocytes in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PTC) becomes exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At one stage this antibody may participate in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> in the NZB mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently studied a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> who had persistently high serum titers of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) that were also demonstrated in a hemolysate of his erythrocytes obtained at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We affinity-purified the antibody and sought its binding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bromelain-treated erythrocytes (BrE) because of the IgM isotype of the antibody, since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> is not a constituent of the erythrocyte wall, and because the anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, with which aCL are known to cross-react, are not located at the outer leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found binding of the antibody to HBrE in their hemolysates and by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that the aCL cross-reacted extensively with PTC, as well as with other anionic or zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The purified IgM antibody lysed BrE in the presence of complement and also bound to in vitro-aged erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because this patient had no other evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or any other autoimmune condition, his disease may represent a variant of the recently described <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
