<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recent interest has been expressed in rheumatic manifestations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV)-infected populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of the musculoskeletal manifestations and serological markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in HCV-infected patients in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety anti-HCV-positive patients were consecutively interviewed and examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of autoantibodies and their association with rheumatologic symptoms were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rheumatic manifestations were found in 28 subjects (31%), and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> (9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo> (11%), sicca symptoms (8%), cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> (1%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rheumatic complications were not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> severity, or subjects' gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> was reported by 22 patients (24%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> was diagnosed in 14 (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine percent of the patients had at least one autoantibody detected in their serum, the most prevalent being rheumatoid factor (RF), 44%; antinuclear antibody (ANA), 38%; and IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (ac1), 28% and 22%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of autoantibodies was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> severity or rheumatic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal manifestations and autoimmune markers are common in HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An investigation of risk factors for HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is pertinent in a patient presenting new rheumatic manifestations and should be included in the history of present illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies of these disorders may uncover the full spectrum of these associations and provide new insights into their operating mechanisms </plain></SENT>
