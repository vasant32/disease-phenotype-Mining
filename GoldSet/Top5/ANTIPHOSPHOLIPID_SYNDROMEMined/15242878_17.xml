<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, human antiphospholipid (aPL) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to disrupt this crystallization and accelerate coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a study with small, well-defined groups of patients to investigate whether these effects on A5 binding and activity are also detectable in plasmas from patients with the aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A5 binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> was significantly reduced by plasmas of patients with the aPL syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> compared with healthy controls (mean +/- SD, 26.7 +/- 4.3 ng/well [n = 25] vs 30.5 +/- 3.1 ng/well [n = 20], P &lt; .01) and the non-aPL <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> group (29.9 +/- 3.2 ng/well [n = 15], P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity was reduced by plasmas of patients with aPL syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> compared with aPL antibodies without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (182 +/- 31% [n = 25] vs 210 +/- 35% [n = 26], P &lt; .01), non-aPL <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (229 +/- 16% [n = 15], P &lt; .001), and healthy controls (231 +/- 14% [n = 30], P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in accordance with recent AFM data with monoclonal human aPL antibodies, plasmas from patients with aPL antibodies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> reduce both A5 binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and A5 <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This "annexin A5 resistance" identifies a novel mechanism for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
