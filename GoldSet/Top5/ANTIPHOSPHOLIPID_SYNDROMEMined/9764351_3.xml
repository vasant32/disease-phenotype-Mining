<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: Low serum placental isoferritin (PLF), an immunosuppressive cytokine-like protein, was found in women with underlying placento-vascular dysfunction, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclamptic toxemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible contribution of this placental product in the assessment of pregnant patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Seventy-five healthy pregnant women used as controls and 25 preselected pregnant patients with either SLE and/or APS were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study patients were in remission during conception and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients agreed to give 5 ml of venous blood at midgestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples were frozen and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After delivery, pregnancy outcomes were gathered from hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen (68%) women had uneventful pregnancies and deliveries (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) whereas 8 (32%) showed pathologic obstetric outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean midgestational serum PLF levels were similar in the control and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome groups (87 U/ml), whereas significantly lower levels (37 U/ml) were measured in the pathologic outcome group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff level of 10 U/ml, 85% from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome group and 15% from the pathologic outcome group were above this threshold level, with 60% specificity and 100% sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that PLF values may reflect placento-vascular functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These may represent a predictive biomarker for developing obstetric complications in pregnant women with either SLE and/or APS </plain></SENT>
