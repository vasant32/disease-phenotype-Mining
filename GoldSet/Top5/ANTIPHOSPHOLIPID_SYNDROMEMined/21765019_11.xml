<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A first TE is considered rare in aPL carriers, but previous studies did not consider the aPL profile nor was the test positivity confirmed in a reference laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 104 subjects with high-risk aPL profile (positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin, and anti-Î²(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies, triple positivity) confirmed in a reference laboratory, were followed up for a mean of 4.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 25 first TEs (5.3% per year): the cumulative incidence after 10 years was 37.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.9%-54.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, male sex (hazard ratio = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-13.1, P = .007) and risk factors for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.5, P = .01) were independent predictors for TEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin did not significantly affect the incidence of TE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the occurrence of a first TE in carriers of high-risk aPL profile is considerable; it is more frequent among male subjects and in the presence of additional risk factors for venous TE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data can help in the decision to initiate primary thromboprophylaxis in these subjects </plain></SENT>
