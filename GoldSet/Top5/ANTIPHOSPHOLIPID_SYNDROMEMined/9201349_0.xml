<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are associated with a large number of neurologic syndromes, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (CI) being the most common of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cases the pathogenesis of the CI is poorly understood and remains controversial; however, the existence of a vasculopathy is indubitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of two young patients with CI and diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> who were submitted to cerebral angiograms, and one of them to necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case the angiographic findings were similar to those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other case we observed obstruction in internal carotid artery at the angiography that looked like <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in situ; at necropsy we found non-atherosclerotic obstruction in coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>In summary, is the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate the discussion and demonstrate that vasculitic mechanisms may be involved in the vasculopathy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> even though <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occur more frequently </plain></SENT>
