<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with aPE (9 IgG and 13 IgM) as the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) detected by ELISA were assigned to 4 groups: thromboembolic episodes (TEE) (Group I, n = 6); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (LR) without TEE, (Group II, n = 4); both LR and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (Group III, n = 4); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (Group IV, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sera were analyzed in ELISA with and without bovine serum and with a purified chromatographic fraction containing LMWK, HMWK, and HMWK binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven aPE were serum dependent: mostly IgG (7/9) and some IgM (4/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 11 serum dependent aPE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 7 IgG and 2 IgM were kininogen reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some serum independent IgM were better detected in the absence than in the presence of serum in the ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the 18 patients, kininogens and/or HMWK binding proteins served as a "cofactor" significantly more often for aPE IgG than for aPE IgM (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kininogen dependent aPE Ig were observed more often in patients with LR with or without TEE (6/8) than in those with SLE or primary APS (0/4) but this difference merely tended to significance (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, one with TEE, the other with primary APS, the IgM aPE was dependent on a serum "cofactor" that was not kininogen </plain></SENT>
