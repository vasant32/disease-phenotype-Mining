<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SLE (n=217) were tested for the presence of aPE, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prospective aPL-related clinical manifestations studied were: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, recurrent fetal losses, heart valvulopathies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 109 SLE patients (50.23%) were IgG aPE-positive; 17.51% presented aPE as the sole autoantibody and had some clinical features of aPL-related clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG aPE were associated to the presence of heart valvulopathies (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A statistical difference was also found when considering high levels of IgG aPE (O.D.&gt;0.600) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The evaluation of IgG aPE may allow us to detect some more patients with aPL-related clinical manifestations in the SLE population, aPE correlated particularly with valvulopathies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
