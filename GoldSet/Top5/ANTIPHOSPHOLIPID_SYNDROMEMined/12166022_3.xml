<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the impact of unrestricted fetal well-being tests and sonographic evaluations on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> rate, we evaluated a total of 1,810 pregnancies 20 weeks of gestation or more from a single private clinic serving a mixed population of high and low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were performed high-resolution sonography during each trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, on each prenatal visit, fetal heart rate, position and amniotic fluid index were documented by a limited sonographic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further sonographic studies were done whenever deemed necessary depending on the clinical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biophysical profiles were performed in the third trimester at any time a risk factor was identified, and repeated as frequently as estimated necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in utero were documented and the associated maternal risk factors assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo> occurred among the 1,810 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> rate for this population was determined to be 7.7/1000 births (U.S. national average of 6.7-7.8/1000 births) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common associated maternal complications were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> (4 cases) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except for one fetus lost at 37 weeks had at least one identifiable maternal risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results prove that intensive fetal surveillance, even when unrestricted by economic concerns, has limited effectiveness in avoiding fetal demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is most probably due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> placental and cord accidents that cannot be detected promptly enough or that are simply unavoidable </plain></SENT>
