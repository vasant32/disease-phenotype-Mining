<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After placing the GEB through the lumen of the rigid bronchoscope, the GEB-suction catheter assembly was used to safely withdraw the bronchoscope in a manner mimicking the withdrawal of an intubating laryngeal mask airway (LMA) over the endotracheal tube using a stabilizer rod </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rationale for management and potential advantages of this approach versus use of an airway exchange catheter (including increased stability of an intubation guide) are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: We describe a technique of using a gum elastic bougie to facilitate an endotracheal intubation in a patient undergoing rigid bronchoscopy, which can be useful in a variety of clinical situations when the rigid bronchoscope is used in patients with abnormal airway </plain></SENT>
