<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated that annexin A2 (ANX2) on cell surface could function as a mediator and stimulate tissue factor (TF) expression of monocytes by anti-β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I/β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I complex (anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, ANX2 is not a transmembrane protein and lacks the intracellular signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggests that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) might act as an 'adaptor' for intracellular signal transduction in anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI-induced TF expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated the roles of TLR-4 and its related molecules, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), in anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI-induced TF expressing human monocytic-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 (human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_502'>monocytic leukaemia</z:mpath>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship of TLR-4 and ANX2 in this process was also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Along with TF, expression of TLR-4, MD-2 and MyD88 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells increased significantly when treated by anti-β₂GPI (10 µg/ml)/β₂GPI (100 µg/ml) complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of paclitaxel, which competes with the MD-2 ligand, could inhibit the effects of anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI on TLR-4, MD-2, MyD88 and TF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both ANX2 and TLR-4 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cell lysates could bind to β₂GPI that had been conjugated to a column (β₂GPI-Affi-Gel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TLR-4, MD-2, MyD88 and TF expression was remarkably diminished in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells infected with ANX2-specific <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference (RNAi) lentivirus (LV-RNAi-ANX2), in spite of treatment with a similar concentration of anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that TLR-4 and its signal transduction pathway contribute to anti-β₂GPI/β₂GPI-induced TF expression in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells, and the effects of TLR-4 with ANX2 are tightly co-operative </plain></SENT>
