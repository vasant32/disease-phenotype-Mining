<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of the circumoral lesion and scalp, were originally reported as containing extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, but on review, both showed the typical appearance of a benign malformation of the hair follicle known as basaloid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regrowth of hair and partial resolution of the peri-oral plaque occurred with more aggressive treatment of her SLE, but the basaloid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> in her scalp skin persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a known, but rare, association between this pattern of basaloid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis, but only two cases have been described in association with SLE and none with APLS </plain></SENT>
