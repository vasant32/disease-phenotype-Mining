<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of prevalence of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> and the possible correlation between aPL seropositivity and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> and 38 patients with non-malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of breast</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antibodies to beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta2GPI) were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The aCL as well as anti-beta2GPI were positive in 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, who at the same time presented with symptoms of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group 2 patients were positive for anti-beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have not observed a difference of aPL prevalence between the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and aPL seropositivity deserves further investigations </plain></SENT>
