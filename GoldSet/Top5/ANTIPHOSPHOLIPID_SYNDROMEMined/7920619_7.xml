<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments assessed were: (1) aspirin 75 mg daily, (2) <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (international normalised ratios (INRs) 2.0-2.9) +/- aspirin 75 mg daily, and (3) <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (INRs &gt; 2.9) +/- aspirin 75 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Where patients had received two or three of these treatments successively, the periods of time on each treatment were added and the number of patients with recurrence(s) on each treatment were compared by Fisher's exact probability test. 'High' anticoagulation (INRs &gt; 2.9) +/- aspirin 75 mg daily was more effective than aspirin 75 mg daily, there was a trend in favour of 'high' anticoagulation (P = 0.066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated when comparing 'low' anticoagulation +/- aspirin 75 mg daily with aspirin 75 mg daily (P = 0.092) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aggressive anticoagulation with or without low-dose aspirin is effective in preventing further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in APS </plain></SENT>
