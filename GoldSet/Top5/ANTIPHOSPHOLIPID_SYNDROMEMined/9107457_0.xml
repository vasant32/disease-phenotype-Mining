<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The screening included specific tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (ANA, specific organ antibodies, immune complexes research, etc.), the immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) for the research of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and the determination of the kaolin coagulation time (KCT) through Exener method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine gravids out of 15 were positive both to LAC and ACA antibodies, two gravids were positive to only ACA antibodies, while four had no antibody reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, whatever the effective mechanism is, it seems ascertained that several cases of unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> are related to <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nowadays the above-mentioned syndrome is successfully treated using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> immunosuppressors and platelet antiaggregators which reduce autoimmune reaction and thrombotic episodes </plain></SENT>
