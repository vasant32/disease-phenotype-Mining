<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of a new commercial SCT for identifying LA in patients who meet the clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and its association with thrombotic events were evaluated here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients who met the clinical criteria for APS according to the Sapporo International Consensus Statement were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine patients who did not meet the clinical criteria for APS, and 20 blood donors were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples from the patients and controls were tested for LA using a new commercial SCT with low and high synthetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained by diluted Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCT's sensitivity for identifying LA in patients who met the clinical criteria of APS was higher compared to APTT and dRVVT (53.3% vs. 31.1% and 31.1%), and the specificities of these assays were 96.6%, 100%, and 98.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When dRVVT was combined with SCT, and dRVVT was combined with APTT their sensitivities were 57.7% and 48.8%, and their specificities were 96.6% and 98.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that the combination of dRVVT with SCT was associated with total thrombotic events (odds ratio (OR)=11.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.25-106.3, P=0.031) as well as with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR=4.09, 95% CI=1.16-14.43, P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to our results, SCT is the most sensitive assay for identifying LA in patients who meet the clinical criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the highest sensitivity was reached with a combination of SCT and dRVVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The method's association with total thrombotic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was in fact significant </plain></SENT>
