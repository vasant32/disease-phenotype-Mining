<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is now well recognised that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPAs) have been shown to require a cofactor, beta 2 glycoprotein-I (beta 2 GPI), for binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, and recently beta 2 GPI has been identified as the antigenic target for some aPAs. beta 2 GPI possesses in vitro <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> properties and modulation of beta 2 GPI function may therefore result in altered haemostatic regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the influence of plasma derived aPAs and beta 2 GPI on factor XII activation on the surface of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor XIIa generation was dependent on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase treatment of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> and beta 2 GPI inhibited the factor XIIa generation in a concentration dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No consistent effects on factor XIIa generation were demonstrated with the IgG fractions from patients with aPAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the beta 2 GPI activity was demonstrated by some antibodies, and study with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> affinity purified antibody indicated that antibody concentration is critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that perturbation of beta 2 GPI function may contribute to the pathogenic mechanism for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in some patients with aPAs </plain></SENT>
