<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical charts of 9 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions, seen in the Department of Ophthalmology, Okayama University Hospital, were reviewed, and pathological sections were restained immunohistochemically for IgG4-, IgG-, and CD138-positive plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of IgG4-positive lesions was based on 10 or more IgG4-positive plasma cells in a high-power field and greater than 40% ratios of IgG4-positive plasma cells/CD138-positive plasma cells and IgG4-positive plasma cells/IgG-positive plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG4-positive lesions were determined as absent in 5 patients (4 with bilateral lacrimal/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral conjunctival lesion), none of whom showed systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IgG4-positive lesions were present in 4 patients (3 with bilateral lacrimal/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral lacrimal/orbital lesion), who showed systemic manifestations : one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto thyroiditis</z:hpo>, one with IgG4-positive bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333967" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor</z:e>, one with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo>, and one with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IgG4-positive ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions might be used as a benchmark for the probable presence of other systemic lymphoid lesions </plain></SENT>
