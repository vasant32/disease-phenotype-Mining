<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo>, resistance to activated protein C (factor V Leiden), protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> as well as some rare forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is possible that other inherited conditions might also predispose to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> at a young age with no provoking event or who have a positive family history or whose <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> involves an unusual site should be investigated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The management of a patient identified as having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormality</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> will depend on a variety of factors such as the patient's individual and family thrombotic history, the site of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the presence of other prothrombotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of prophylactic anticoagulation during pregnancy and the puerperium requires particularly careful consideration in thrombophilic women </plain></SENT>
