<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of TE in paediatric SLE patients with LAC and to determine if anticoagulation was effective to decrease morbidity, and prevent recurrent TE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 24 patients (16%) were LAC positive, and 21 TE occurred in 13 of these LAC positive patients (54% incidence of TE in LAC positive patients) </plain></SENT>
