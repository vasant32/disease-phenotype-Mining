<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and an infiltrating mass in the porta hepatis with compression on the common bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed an irregular narrowing of the mid-part of the common bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was referred for explorative laparotomy, which revealed a hypervascular mass in the liver hilus surrounded by many blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of portal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further haematological examination for the cause of portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> revealed an anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0597984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary stricture</z:e> due to portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernoma</z:e> (portal biliopathy) which was not diagnosed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0597984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Biliary strictures</z:e> associated with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are due to extrinsic compression by collaterals and can also be induced by ischemic injury secondary to venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> of the choledochal vascular plexus </plain></SENT>
