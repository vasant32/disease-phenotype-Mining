<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) in pregnancy and puerperium in women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> iliofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> iliofemoral DVT using CDT between June 1999 and June 2009 were followed yearly by colour duplex ultrasound scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of these patients who became pregnant during the follow-up period, three months to 10 years after CDT, was included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, thromboprophylaxis using LMWH was prescribed according to individual risk assessment, and the women were regularly assessed for adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> had this treatment discontinued before the sixth week of pregnancy in order to prevent potential teratogenic adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of LMWH was started at international normalized ratio â‰¤2.0, and continued during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postnatal, the anticoagulation treatment was converted back to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and LMWH discontinued after a bridging period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women, who, prior to pregnancy, had discontinued anticoagulation treatment after CDT, were prescribed anticoagulation treatment using LMWH as early in pregnancy as practical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LMWH was continued during pregnancy, delivery and for six weeks postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women were prescribed graduated compression stockings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 33 women completed 45 pregnancies, 44 singletons and 1 gemelli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 24 (53%) of the cases, the mother had been treated with adjunctive stenting immediately following the CDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In nine (21%) of the pregnancies, the mother had been on long-time anticoagulation treatment using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prior to conception due to permanent severe risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> was demonstrated in 31 (69%) of the pregnancies, and in 29 (64%) of the patients, the previous DVT was <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis using tinzaparin was given in 41 (91%) and using dalteparin in four (9%) of the pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Doses of LMWH during pregnancy were adjusted according to risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy was terminated by induced delivery at week 22 due to fetal malformations, and two of the pregnancies (4%) were complicated by intrauterine fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, one in week 39 due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1397629" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal infection</z:e> and one in week 23 due to intrauterine fetal growth restriction caused by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of the pregnancies was carried out without recurrence of DVT or maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and the mother remained having patent deep veins postnatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mother with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> had a recurrent DVT complicated by iliac stent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This mother was prior to pregnancy on long-time treatment using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, she was erroneously treated with LMWH in standard prophylaxis doses instead of therapeutic doses and without adding aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After CDT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> iliofemoral DVT including adjunctive stenting, pregnancy can be carried out almost uneventful even in women at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy, using LMWH in a dosage adjusted to individual risk assessment, is essential </plain></SENT>
