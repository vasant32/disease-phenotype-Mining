<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How SLE and its treatment affect pregnancy outcomes is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective analysis of 41 SLE patients (55 pregnancies) who were followed at our university hospital from January 2000 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 30.6±4.8 years and mean disease duration was 6.6±5.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of artificial abortions, live birth rate was 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significantly, more women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> pregnancies were complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) than women with live birth pregnancies (two of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> pregnancies (25%) versus one of 42 live birth pregnancies (2%); p=0.014) and hypocomplementemia at conception (four of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo> pregnancies (50%) versus six of 42 live birth pregnancies (14%); p=0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with nonrenal pregnancies, renal pregnancies were younger at SLE disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, had a lower positivity of anti-RNP antibody, and were more complicated with pregnancy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Past maximum dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, the dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> at conception, and percentage of past steroid pulse therapy were higher in renal pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of pregnancies were not significantly different both for mothers and for infants between renal and nonrenal pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that it is necessary to provide SLE mothers with the proper information before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with APS or hypocomplementemia should be regarded with particular attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimal management of mothers and infants requires collaborative efforts of rheumatologists and obstetricians </plain></SENT>
