<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of APSN in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kidney biopsy specimens obtained from 162 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> were retrospectively examined for the presence of APSN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data obtained at the time of kidney biopsy and during a mean follow-up of 7 years were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases for which serial kidney biopsy specimens were available, the evolution of APSN was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found APSN in 17 (10.4%) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp>), 12 with focal or proliferative lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both activity and chronicity indexes were higher in patients with APSN when compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> without APSN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with APSN had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo> levels at the time or kidney biopsy, as well as a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002743'>GN</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at the end of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were found in 52% of those with APSN and in 27% of those without APSN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial kidney biopsy specimens were available from 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase of <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp> was found in the second biopsy particularly in those patients with APSN in the first biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APSN is a risk factor that contributes to an elevated prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0005264'>glomerular sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>APSN should be included in the classification criteria of APS, and the use of appropriate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy should be tested </plain></SENT>
