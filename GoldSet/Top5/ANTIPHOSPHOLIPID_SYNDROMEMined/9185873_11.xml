<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, in humans, have been associated with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> including anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies have also been demonstrated in autoimmune-prone MRL-Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr), BXSB-Mp-(+yaa) (BXSB) and (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous work, we had shown that gonadectomized or intact male and female non-autoimmune C57BL/6 mice, upon treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, express autoantibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we extend these findings and show that the expression of these antibodies persists for months even after the exposure to exogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> has been terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These antibodies are of IgM and IgG, but not IgA, isotypes, and the predominant IgG subisotype is IgG2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi>-induced antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> only minimally cross-reacted with DNA, actin or ovalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The binding of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> from autoimmune human patients in general has been shown to depend upon the presence of a cofactor, beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated C57BL/6 mice, as well as in SLE-prone MRL/lpr and BXSB mice, the binding of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> was not enhanced, but rather reduced, in the presence of human beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, addition of exogenous human beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I to purified immunoglobulin fractions containing anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies reduces, rather than enhances, the binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these data show that persistent detectable levels of IgG and IgM autoantibodies specific for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> can be induced in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment alone (i.e. without administration of autoantigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, we characterize these antibodies regarding their kinetics, cross-reactivity, isotype distribution and cofactor (beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I) requirements </plain></SENT>
