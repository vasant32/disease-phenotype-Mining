<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although the medical literature currently provides a growing number of isolated case reports of patients with clinically well-defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and persistently negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), there are no studies including a series of patients addressing the clinical features of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors assessed clinical manifestations of APS in 154 patients: 87 patients with seropositive APS and 67 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or pregnancy morbidity persistently negative for aPL and presenting with at least two additional non-criteria manifestations of APS (the so-called 'seronegative APS', SN-APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were interviewed at the time of recruitment, and a retrospective file review was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the frequency of thrombotic events or obstetric morbidity in patients with SN-APS versus patients with seropositive APS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (31.4% vs 31.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (23.8% vs 28.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (14.9% vs 17.2%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (11.9% vs 10.3%), early <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> (67.1% vs 52.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo> (62.5% vs 59.4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (28.1% vs 21.7%) or pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> (28.1% vs 23.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classic and SN-APS patients show similar clinical profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that clinical management in patients with APS should not be based only on the presence of conventional aPL </plain></SENT>
