<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the clinical significance of positive anti-beta2-GP-I with negative aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2002 through July 2003, 1,179 serum samples obtained in our hospital from the Community of Madrid were tested for anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical records of patients with discordant anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with discordant anti-beta2-GP-I and aCL were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex and risk factors of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the risk for developing APS criteria associated with anti-beta2-GP-I was significant [odds ratio 3.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-14.27; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>15 out of 56 patients (26.8%) had positive anti-beta2-GP-I and negative aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5 out of 15 anti-beta2-GP-I-positive patients had clinical APS without serological nor clinical evidence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Determination of anti-beta2-GP-I should be considered in individual cases with clinical manifestations of primary APS and repeated negative results on conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> test </plain></SENT>
