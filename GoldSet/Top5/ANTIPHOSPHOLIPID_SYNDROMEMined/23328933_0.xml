<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) have been shown to induce tissue factor (TF) expression in monocytes and endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying signal transduction has been more or less elusive in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that aPL enter the lysosomal route in monocytes and dendritic cells, and subsequently activate endosomal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>-oxidase (NOX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The generation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> which is dismutated to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> upregulates the intracellular toll like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8, and leads to robust production of inflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that induction of TF by aPL follows the same signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of endosomal NOX by the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channel blocker niflumic acid or capture of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> by the radical scavenger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> blocks TF induction by aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, monocytes from mice deficient in NOX2 do not increase TF surface expression in response to aPL, while cells from mice deficient in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) show an increased response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, also induction of TF by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> fac tor (TNF)α and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) was strongly dependent on the activation of endosomal NOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While TNFα apparently depends alm ost fully on endosomal NOX, signalling of LPS is only partially dependent on this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data provide further insight into the well-known role of reactive oxygen species in the induction of TF expression and suggest that endosomal signalling may represent a central coordinating point in this process </plain></SENT>
