<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) consists of five repeats of a homologous domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We designed a series of human beta2-GPI mutant genes, ie, three mutant genes lacking the domain(s) present in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal region and two of those present in the COOH-terminal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutant genes were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) infected with recombinant baculoviruses and the mutant proteins were secreted into the culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular mass of the purified mutant proteins, estimated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, was fairly consistent with the size calculated from their nucleotide sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding of beta2-GPI to solid-phase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) was diminished by the deletion of the fifth domain (domain V) from its complete structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site of beta2-GPI is located on its domain V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal anti-CL antibodies (aCL) derived either from NZW x BXSB (WB) F1 mice or from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> bound directly to the domain V-deleted mutant protein (DI-IV) absorbed not only on an oxygenated but also on a plain <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude from this study that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> for aCL is exposed on a conformationally changed structure of beta2-GPI by interacting with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> or on the mutant protein, DI-IV </plain></SENT>
