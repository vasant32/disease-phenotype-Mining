<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2-GPI) antibodies was evaluated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), primary and secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2-GPI were tested in 120 patients (39 primary APS, 32 APS with SLE and 49 SLE without APS) by ELISA utilizing irradiated plates in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were also measured in the same patients using standardized assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2-GPI titres correlated strongly to those of aCL (r = 0.816, P = 0.0001), and to those of antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (r = 0.841, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2-GPI were detected in 53.5% of APS patients (38/71), but only in 4.1% of SLE patients without APS (2/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the latter group, 24.5% (12/49) of patients had a positive titre of aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anti-beta 2-GPI assay showed higher specificity for APS than the aCL in APS (96 vs 75%, respectively, chi 2 = 6.75, P = 0.00094) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the assay of anti-beta 2-GPI may improve the specificity for APS </plain></SENT>
