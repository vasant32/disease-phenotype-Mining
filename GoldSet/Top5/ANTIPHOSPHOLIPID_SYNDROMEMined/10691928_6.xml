<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of an anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (LJ1) and an anti-beta2-GPI (RSP-57) human MoAb to bind to apoptotic but not viable cells was demonstrated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both MoAbs were derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parallel analysis of the specificity and affinity of four anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> human MoAbs suggests that the binding of LJ1 MoAb to apoptotic cells is a specific property of this MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RSP-57 MoAb recognizes apoptotic cells through beta2-GPI which becomes available for binding after the interaction with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation provides evidence that the binding of human anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies to apoptotic cells occurs in both a beta2-GPI-dependent and independent way and involves a restricted group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The finding that LJ1 and RSP-57 MoAbs bind apoptotic cells underlines the property of these MoAbs to act as cell membrane markers of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major pathological implications derive from the observation that LJ1 and RSP-57 MoAbs recognize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed on 'early' apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interference with the in vivo clearance and processing of apoptotic cells is a potential pathogenic mechanism of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
