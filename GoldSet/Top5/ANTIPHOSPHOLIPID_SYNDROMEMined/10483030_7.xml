<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One mechanism may involve the binding of aPL directly to the placenta where they may initiate placental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed an immunofluorescent technique to detect human aPL binding to human placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endogenous immunoglobulins were eluted by extensive washing and residual staining was prevented by incorporating multiple blocking steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APL were affinity purified on both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine liposomes from the sera of six patients with aPL (five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) patients and one post bone marrow transplant patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> binding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> term placenta, involving either the trophoblast microvillous surface, stromal and peri-vascular regions was demonstrated by affinity purified aPL from five of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) and western blotting studies have demonstrated that aPL bind a number of placental proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI was not the predominant protein bound by aPL using this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides further evidence for the involvement of aPL in mediating placental damage </plain></SENT>
