<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) have been identified in various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> including APS, but their reactivity patterns remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used eluted endothelial membrane-bound antibodies (EC eluates) to investigate possible cross-reactivity of AECAs and their pathogenic effects on endothelial cell integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and nonspecific nature of AECAs was confirmed by our finding that they cross-react with fibroblasts and platelets and bind to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, platelet-bound antibodies from sera of patients with APS reacted with endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent binding of human monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody was demonstrated, but this antibody did not compete with AECAs in EC eluates, indicating that only small portion of AECAs are directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although sera from APS patients prolonged coagulation tests, EC eluates did not affect coagulation, suggesting that AECAs may belong to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> subsets that does not interfere with coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular damage is a common feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> associated with AECAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible effects of AECAs on vascular perturbance were investigated by cytotoxicity, attachment, and migration assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although AECAs were not shown to be cytotoxic or to affect cell attachment, sera from APS patients caused reduced cellular migration (by 30%), and EC eluates caused even more significant inhibition (by 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest possible interference of AECAs in vascular repair mechanisms and provide an explanation for the thrombotic complications frequently seen in APS patients </plain></SENT>
