<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the role of LA with the thrombotic tendency in various <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> we evaluated 38 patients with confirmed LA [tissue thromboplastin index (TTI) greater than 1.3; circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> index (CAI) greater than 15], subgrouped as follows: a) LA associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (n = 13); b) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) (n = 16); and c) LA associated with other disorders (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male/female ratio differed between the groups: 0/13, 6/10 and 4/5, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous and arterial thrombotic events were more common in the PAPS group (87%) compared with the SLE group (61%) and the other disorders group (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum ACA antiphospholipid IgG levels by ELISA were increased in the SLE and PAPS patients, but did not differ between the groups (167 +/- 24 vs. 190 +/- 28 mu respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid IgM levels were higher in the SLE group compared with the PAPS group (127 +/- 15 vs. 67 +/- 16 mu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean TTI and CAI levels did not differ between the SLE, PAPS and other disorders groups (1.8 +/- 0.19, 2.8 +/- 0.9, 2.0 +/- 0.3 for TTI; 25 +/- 4, 33 +/- 4, 32 +/- 5 for CAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise TTI, CAI and ACA levels did not differ in patients with or without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the prevalence of thrombotic manifestations varies among patients with similar serum intensities of LA and levels of ACA, suggesting that other factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
