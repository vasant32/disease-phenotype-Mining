<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the clinical features of autoimmune patients with avidity of aPS/PT and determine the diagnostic efficiency of aPS/PT and aPT for assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aPS/PT were of low (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (n = 31) and high (n = 8) avidity out of 48 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the samples with low avidity were positive in aPT ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> or high avidity aPS/PT, there was a significantly greater number of patients with APS as compared to patients with low avidity (38/39 vs. 7/9; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
