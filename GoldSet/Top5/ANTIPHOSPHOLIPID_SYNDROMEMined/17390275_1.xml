<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLS) is characterised by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in association with thrombotic disorders of the arterial and/or venous system, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> patients with APLS are at extremely high risk for graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and graft loss after kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report on the treatment and clinical courses of 6 APLS renal transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3 patients treated with low-dose subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> two had early graft loss due to venous graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; of those patients treated by systemic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (PTT goal 45-55 s) and followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> (INR 2.5-3.0) only one had early graft loss whereas 2 grafts are doing well 2 years post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience as well as recently published data suggest that kidney transplantation can be performed successfully in APLS patients if anticoagulation therapy is performed consistently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A general APL antibody screening prior to kidney transplantation does not seem to be justified at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prospective, randomised multicenter study is warranted to evaluate the management of these patients with respect to intensity, type and duration of anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
