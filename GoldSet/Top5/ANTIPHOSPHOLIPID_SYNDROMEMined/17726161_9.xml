<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently reported that binding of beta(2)GPI to anionic PL facilitates processing and presentation of the cryptic beta(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> that activates pathogenic autoreactive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify mechanisms that induce sustained presentation of the dominant antigenic beta(2)GPI determinant in patients with APS, T-cell proliferation induced by beta(2)GPI-treated phosphatidylserine liposome (beta(2)GPI/PS) was evaluated in bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T cells from patients with APS responded to beta(2)GPI/PS in the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies derived from APS plasma, and this response was completely inhibited either by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of monocytes or by the addition of anti-FcgammaRI antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that efficient presentation of the cryptic determinants can be achieved by monocytes undergoing FcgammaRI-mediated uptake of beta(2)GPI-bound anionic surfaces in the presence of IgG anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, beta(2)GPI-bound oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> or activated platelets also induced the specific T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous exposure to these anionic surfaces may play a critical role in maintaining the pathogenic anti-beta(2)GPI antibody response in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
