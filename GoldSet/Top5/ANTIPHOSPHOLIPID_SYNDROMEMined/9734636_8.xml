<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the incidence of antibodies to solid-phase prothrombin was examined in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and a variety of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly elevated levels of IgG anti-prothrombin (anti-PT) antibodies were detected in 63% of patients with APS (n = 27, median 22 arbitrary units: AU), 33% with SLE (n = 92, median 14 AU) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10 (21%) patients had raised levels of IgG anti-PT antibodies, 30 (62%) had significantly elevated levels of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies and 15 (31%) had elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the LA-positive patients, 15 (43%) were identified with definite APS, eight (23%) with probable APS, two (6%) with possible APS and 10 (28%) patients had no clinical evidence of APS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, identification of the plasma proteins recognized by antibodies from patients with APS may provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the heterogenous clinical manifestations of the APS </plain></SENT>
