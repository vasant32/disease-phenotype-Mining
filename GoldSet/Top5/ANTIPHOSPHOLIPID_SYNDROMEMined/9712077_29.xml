<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, the best-characterized antigenic target for these autoantibodies (or Abs) is the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding protein beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These Abs bind beta2GPI only in the presence of negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> or microtiter <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates that have been specially treated to give the surface a negative charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the binding of these Abs to beta2GPI on negatively charged surfaces is dependent on increased density or neo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> formed as a consequence of a conformational change on beta2GPI, we generated mutants of beta2GPI by site-directed mutagenesis and assessed the binding characteristics of anti-beta2GPI Abs to these mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that mutant F307*, which spontaneously forms significant dimerization, is bound best by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the anti-beta2GPI Abs in an anti-beta2GPI ELISA using irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> microtiter plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, these Abs bound mutant F307* coated onto standard <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> microtiter wells in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, whereas there was minimal binding with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant F307*/C288A, which formed minimal dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Affinity-purified anti-beta2GPI Abs from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> demonstrated significantly higher binding affinity for mutant F307* in fluid phase than for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant F307*/C288A of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that autoantibody binding to beta2GPI is intrinsically of low affinity and that the binding is dependent on the density of the Ag and not on neo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
