<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) or with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) the prevalence of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging changes (MRI) and the relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine consecutive SLE patients, 24 PAPS patients and 31 healthy controls were prospectively included in the study and underwent MRI Scan over a 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI scans were analyzed separately by a neuroradiologist for white matter changes [periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) (0-6 scale), deep white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (0-24 scale)], and one neurologist for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> (0-39 scale) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical assessment consisted of a discriminant analysis performed with SAS-package with MRI data as dependent variables and, as independent variables, age, sex, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, neurological symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, SLE, steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> was increased in both SLE and PAPS groups relative to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PVH and WMH scores were significantly higher in SLE and PAPS than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> did not differ in the SLE group when compared with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PVH and WMH scores were significantly higher in patients with neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a correlation test we found a weak significant correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis found only three independent variables related to PVH and WMH: age, the diagnosis of SLE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Age, presence of SLE and presence of neurological symptoms were independently related with WMH and PVH, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
