<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Having observed a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) upon the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>, as well as a negative association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), we sought to determine if this could be due to urinary loss of aPL and/or other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: IgG and IgM aPL as well as other autoantibodies were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> as antigen in serum and urine from six patients with SLE who had elevated serum aPL levels and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For controls, we studied: (1) three SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> but low aPL levels; (2) three patients with non-SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo>; (3) three SLE patients with high-titer aPL but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>; and (4) 10 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found urinary IgG, but no IgM, aPL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and in one control from Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG aPL had gradually decreased after the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> and had become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgM aPL had also decreased in the four patients who had elevated levels, having reached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels at the time of the study in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an apparent correlation between serum and urine IgG aPL levels but not between urinary IgG aPL and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By Farr's method, we found no urinary anti-DNA despite high serum titers in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two cases and one of the controls in Group 1 who had serum antibodies to extractable antigens also had these antibodies in the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Urinary loss of IgG aPL during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> does not completely explain the reduction in serum aPL, since IgM also decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There could also be decreased synthesis and/or increased catabolism of immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
