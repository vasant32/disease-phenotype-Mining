<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease pattern has raised special interest as a possible link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aPL, oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (oxLDL), and antibodies to oxLDL (Anti-oxLDL) are suggested to play an important role in atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we compared the serum levels of oxLDL and Anti-oxLDL in APS patients (20 subjects with primary APS; 14 subjects with secondary APS) and nonAPS subjects (24 phenotypically healthy controls samples and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> [SLE]) and investigated associations of the above mentioned parameters with the intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), a clinical surrogate parameter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>.SLE patients with and without APS showed significantly increased levels of Anti-oxLDL as compared to the controls group (p = 0.038 and p = 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, oxLDL levels were not significantly different between the controls group and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Anti-oxLDL levels correlated significantly with anticardiolipin (p = 0.002) and beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (p &lt; 0.048), both from IgG isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only SLE patients without APS revealed a significantly elevated production of reactive oxygen species indicating an increased proatherogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the circulation (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patient groups, the circulating levels of oxLDL and Anti-oxLDL showed no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as estimated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
