<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by the autoimmune production of antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, a substance found in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here report the case of a patient with four second trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>, who apart from a heterozygous plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 mutation, had no risk factors explaining her condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the subsequent pregnancy she was therefore put on low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, aspirin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APL), which had been negative before gestation, increased and remained high throughout pregnancy, thus suggesting a pregnancy-induced or -aggravated APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was kept on the above-mentioned medication and delivered a healthy male baby by Caesarean section after an otherwise uneventful pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in order to diagnose and treat pregnancy-triggered APS in patients with unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e>, screening for APL should also be performed at several time points after conception </plain></SENT>
