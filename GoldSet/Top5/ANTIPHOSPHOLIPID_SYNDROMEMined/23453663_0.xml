<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the concentrations of sCD40L in patients with PAPS, and establish its association with the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients with PAPS and healthy controls of the same age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For analysis, patients with PAPS were divided into 2 groups: 1) patients with 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 2) patients with &gt;1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soluble CD40L concentrations were determined by ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sCD40L concentrations were significantly higher in patients with PAPS compared with the controls (9.72 ng ± 11.23 ng/ml vs. 4.69 ± 4.04 ng/ml) (P=.04) There was no association between serum levels of sCD40L and the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: 9.81 ± 9.87 ng/ml vs 9.63 ± 12.75 ng/ml in ≥ 1thrombosis (P=.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women with pregnancy and abortions, (13 patients) concentrations of sCD40L were higher than in those patients without a history of abortion (26 patients) but without statically significant difference (12.11 ± 16.46 ng/ml vs. 8.80 ± 8.61 ng/ml) (P=.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between levels of sCD40L and the total number of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAPS have higher concentrations of sCD40L compared with healthy subjects, although this is not associated with a greater number of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with PAPS, there is a tendency to higher concentrations of sCD40L in women with pregnancy and history of abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the platelet is the main cellular source of sCD40L, is possible that this pathway plays a pathogenic role in patients with PAPS </plain></SENT>
