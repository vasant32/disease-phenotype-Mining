<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IgG from 18 patients with SLE, eight with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 19 controls was examined for its effect on thrombin-induced prostacyclin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells in relation to both the titre of anticardiolipin (ACA) and antiendothelial activity (AEA) and clinical thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although no significant inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release was found overall, examination of subgroups revealed that IgG from patients with ACA produced significant inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release (mean stimulation index IgGM, 0.74 +/- 0.12, P = 0.02) when compared with patients without ACA (1.18 +/- 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between ACA and AEA (r = 0.52, P = 0.006) in the total patient group which was reflected in significant negative correlations between inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release and increasing titre of both ACA (r = -0.42, P = 0.032) and AEA (r = -0.57, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only increasing titre of AEA showed a significant negative correlation with inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release when patients with (r = -0.74, P = 0.0005) and without (r = 0.23, N.S.) thromboses were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The titre of ACA failed to show any significant correlation with inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release in either patients with (r = -0.42, N.S.) or without (r = -0.16, N.S.) thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that previous, sometimes conflicting, reports of an association between inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi> release and ACA may be explained by the co-incidence of AEA with ACA </plain></SENT>
