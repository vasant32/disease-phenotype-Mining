<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant association between anticardiolipin antibodies and venous leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to determine whether such an association is found in venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and if it could also be present in cases involving the arterial and/or arteriolar circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 1995 to March 1997, 48 patients with leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> involving venous (27 cases), arteriovenous (9 cases) or arteriolar (12 cases) circulations were admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiologic diagnosis was based on clinical presentation and duplex Doppler findings examining the superficial and deep venous and arterial circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were searched for in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases: VDRL, ELISA for IgG and IgM <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, antiprothrombinase circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were found in 22 of the 48 patients (46%): 12/27 (44%) involved venous leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (anticardiolipin antibodies, 5 cases; circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, 4 cases; both, 2 cases); 1/9 involved arteriovenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (anticardiolipin antibodies, 5 cases); 9/12 involved arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (anticardiolipin antibodies, 3 cases; circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, 6 cases; both, 3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 9 patients also had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was found in 3 cases with venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient among the 5 with arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> had a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our cohort is too small for a formal conclusion but underlines two points: 1. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can be associated with venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> independently of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that leukocyte stasis and endothelial cell activation causes an immune reaction implicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> has been put forward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of an antiaggregate treatment or an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment should be discussed, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possible association between arteriolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> requires further large scale studies </plain></SENT>
