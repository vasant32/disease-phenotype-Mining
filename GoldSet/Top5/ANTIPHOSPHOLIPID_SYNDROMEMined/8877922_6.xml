<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the ability of IgG aCL antibody positive sera to induce endothelial cell activation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG with aCL activity was isolated by affinity purification from 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and 3 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in serum-free conditions and examined in a resting state or after activation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HUVEC were exposed to beta 2-GPI alone, IgG alone or IgG plus beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we examined the ability of sera from the same patients with SLE and primary APS to activate HUVEC in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither beta 2-GPI, IgG aCL, nor IgG aCL plus beta 2-GPI bound to resting or cytokine activated endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, sera from the same patients did not induce in vitro activation of endothelial cells as assessed by enhanced surface expression of intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, and E-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results suggest that beta 2-GPI deposition on either resting or activated endothelial cells and modulation of its proposed in vivo <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity through subsequent aCL antibody binding does not account for the thrombotic manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
