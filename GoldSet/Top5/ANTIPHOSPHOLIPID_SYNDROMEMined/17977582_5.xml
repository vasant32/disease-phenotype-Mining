<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The catastrophic variant of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS), also now known as Asherson's syndrome, is defined as a potential life-threatening variant of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, which is characterized by multiple small-vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that can lead to multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relapses in patients with the CAPS are very uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of patients with relapsing episodes of CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with relapsing CAPS are presented with their clinical and laboratory features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven episodes of CAPS that occurred in the 3 patients reported were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time between the episodes of CAPS was 12.5 months (range, 2.5-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Precipitating factors were identified in 2 episodes only (Legionella <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747479" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal infection</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most significant manifestations of the episodes were renal involvement (5 episodes), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and cardiac involvement (4 episodes), and pulmonary and hepatic involvement (3 episodes each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, laboratory features of definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001937'>microangiopathic hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (MHA) were present in 5 of 7 episodes of relapsing CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining episodes presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001981'>schistocytes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> but data concerning <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and Coombs tests were not reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab was used in 2 episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relapses occur very infrequently in patients with the CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of MHA is common in these patients, suggesting that an association between MHA and relapses of CAPS could be present and that a "continuum" between various MHAs might exist, as recently suggested </plain></SENT>
