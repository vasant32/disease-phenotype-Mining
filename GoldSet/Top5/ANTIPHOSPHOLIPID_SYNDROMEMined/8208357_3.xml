<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on eight children who suffered from cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the age of 2 or up to 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) were detected in two cases during the ischemic event and in six cases during follow-up examinations (after six weeks or within a span of six years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients multiple stenoses of basal cerebral arteries were found; one of them suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in one patient was linked to an asymptomatic mycoplasmal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three cases, one of the parents was also APLA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, and in four cases immunoglobulin infusions were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> subsided after the child with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> received immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No effect of medication could be established in the other children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concept of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is still evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As none of the common risk factors pertaining to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in adults apply to children, pediatric research may offer a suitable platform for specific investigations on the causal, pathogenetic role of APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> should be tested for APLA </plain></SENT>
