<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 234 patients (172 male, 62 female; mean age: 58.6 +/- 15.9 years) of whom 126 (53.8%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and 108 (46.2%) with other underlying diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatologic disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> renal disfunction, cerebrovascular disorders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo>) were included to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical characteristics, growth properties and antibiotic susceptibility patterns were used for the identification of the isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of specimens were as follows; sputum (124), tracheal aspirate (54), pleural fluid (27), bronchoalveolar lavage (23), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> material (7) and lung biopsy (1) material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nocardia spp were isolated from four out of 234 patients (1.7%), and two of them were identified as N. farcinica, one as N. asteroides and one as N. otitidiscaviarum </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Nocardiosis</z:e> has been presented as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infection</z:hpo> in two of the cases, and brain and soft tissue abscesses in one of each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, E-test and broth microdilution methods were used in order to detect the antibiotic susceptibilities of the strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> isolates were found susceptible to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="471744,51799">imipenem</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2637">amikacin</z:chebi> and resistant to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="42355,48923">erythromycin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28971">ampicillin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, since there is an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients recently, Nocardia spp. should be considered in such patients, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="46324,9533">TMP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">SMX</z:chebi> should be used with care for empirical therapy </plain></SENT>
