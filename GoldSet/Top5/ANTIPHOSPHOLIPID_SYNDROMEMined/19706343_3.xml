<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) is a five-domain protein associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), however, its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biological function is yet to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI is N-glycosylated at several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32664">asparagine residues</z:chebi> and the glycan moiety conjugated to residue 143 has been proposed to interact with the Gly40-Arg43 motif of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Gly40-Arg43 motif has also been proposed to serve as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> for the anti-beta2GPI autoantibody associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the structure or composition of the glycan at Asn-143 might be associated with the APS symptom by shielding or exposing the Gly40-Arg43 motif towards the anti-beta2GPI autoantibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis we used mass spectrometry (MS) for comparative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24396">glycopeptide</z:chebi> profiling of human beta2GPI obtained from blood serum from four healthy test subjects and six APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It revealed significant differences in the extent of sialylation and branching of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> at Asn-143 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biantennary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> were more abundant than triantennary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> at Asn-143 in both healthy subjects and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In APS patient samples we observed a decrease in sialylated triantennary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> and an increase in sialylated biantennary glycan structures, as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that some APS patients have beta2GPI molecules with a reduced number of negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> units in the glycan structure at Asn-143 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This alteration of the electrostatic properties of the glycan moiety may attenuate the intramolecular interactions with the positively charged Gly40-Arg43 motif of beta2GPI and, in turn, leads to conformational instability and exposure of the disease-related linear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> Gly40-Arg43 to the circulating autoantibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study suggests a link between site-specific glycan profiles of beta2GPI and the pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
