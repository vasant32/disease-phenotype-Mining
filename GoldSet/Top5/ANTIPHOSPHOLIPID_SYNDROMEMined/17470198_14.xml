<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that binding of dimerized beta2-GPI to platelets via ApoER2' sensitizes platelets for second activating stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Determine the region of ApoER2 involved in the binding of dimeric beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultured human megakaryocytes (MK) and three different human megakaryocytic cell lines were used for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> isolation to clone and express recombinant soluble platelet ApoER2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Domain deletion mutants of ApoER2 were constructed to identify the binding site for dimeric beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of ApoER2 splice variants in platelets was demonstrated by immuno-blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three different <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splice variants were isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four types of megakaryocytic cells used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis identified the splice variants: (i) shApoER2Delta5 lacking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) binding domains 4, 5 and 6; (ii) shApoER2Delta4-5 lacking <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> binding domains 3, 4, 5, 6 and (iii) shApoER2Delta3-4-5 lacking <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> binding domains 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of three splice variants of ApoER2 on platelets was confirmed by immuno-blotting, with ApoER2Delta4-5 being the most abundantly expressed splice variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upon stimulation with dimeric beta2-GPI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three splice variants were translocated to the cytosol; however, ApoER2Delta4-5 translocation was most prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dimeric beta2-GPI binds platelet ApoER2 variants via <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-binding domain 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three different ApoER2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splice variants were isolated from MK and platelets express <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three splice variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> splice variants were shown to be functional by translocation upon stimulation with dimeric beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
