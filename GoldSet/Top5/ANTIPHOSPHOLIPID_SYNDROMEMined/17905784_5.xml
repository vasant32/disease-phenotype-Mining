<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), we asked the question whether BCDT affects levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in our cohort of 32 SLE patients given this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified seven SLE patients who had undergone BCDT and had had at least two moderate positive aCL titres at least 12 weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these only one patient had APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL were measured at time 0 and 6-9 months post BCDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At time 0, the mean IgG aCL level was 20.6 standardized IgG antiphospholipid units (GPLU) (range (SD) 10-32, (10.1), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level &lt;5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6-9 months post <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> the IgG aCL levels in six of the seven patients was undetectable and in the other patient the level reduced from 25 GPLU to 15 GPLU (p&lt;0.005, two-tailed paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, only one patient had a mildly positive anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) antibody level at 30% (compared to an in-house standard), which fell to 5% post-BCDT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This small observational study in patients with SLE is the first to demonstrate that BCDT results in a significant reduction in levels of IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
