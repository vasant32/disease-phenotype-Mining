<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although, efforts of standardization for these 'criteria' aPL tests have been conducted over the last 27 years, reports of inconsistencies, inter-assay and inter-laboratory variation in the results of aCL, LAC, and anti-β(2)GPI, and problems with the interpretation and the clinical value of the tests still exist, which affect the consistency of the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Task Force of scientists and pioneers in the field from different countries, subdivided in three working groups, discussed and analyzed critical questions related to 'criteria' aPL tests in an evidence-based manner, during the 13(th) International Congress on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA 2010, April 13-16, 2010, Galveston, TX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included: review of the standardization and the need for international consensus protocol for aCL and anti-β(2)GPI tests; the use of monoclonal and/or polyclonal standards in the calibration curve of those tests; and the need for establishment of international units of measurement for anti-β(2)GPI tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group also reviewed the recently updated guidelines for LAC testing, and analyzed and discussed the possibility of stratification of 'criteria' aPL tests as risk factors for APS, as well as the clinical value of single positive vs. multiple aPL positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group members presented, discussed, analyzed data, updated and re-defined those critical questions at a preconference workshop that was open to congress attendees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of this Task Force </plain></SENT>
