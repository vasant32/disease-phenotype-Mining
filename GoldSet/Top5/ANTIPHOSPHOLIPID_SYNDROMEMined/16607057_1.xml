<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure in the right and left arms was equal, and no murmurs or bruits were heard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on admission and remained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range during the hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (2.3 mg/dL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001679'>abnormality of the aorta</z:hpo> or its branches, but the left pulmonary artery showed occlusion at the proximal portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) revealed segmental wall thickening of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
