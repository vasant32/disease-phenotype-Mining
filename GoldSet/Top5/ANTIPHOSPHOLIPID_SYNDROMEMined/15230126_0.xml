<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3</z:chebi> was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in a total of 41 patients with SLE (n = 17), PAPS (n = 14) and secondary APS (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 10 healthy subjects (donors) served as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3</z:chebi> concentration &gt; 40 mcmol/l was stated high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLE activity was assessed by V </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nasonova's scale and SLEDAI index (SLEDAI &gt; 9 indicated SLE exacerbation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAPS were divided into two groups depending on clinical symptoms: 7 patients with significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or history of more than two thrombotic complications (group 1); 7 patients with the history of two or less thromboses (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean serum nitrate concentration in the SLE group was 43.59 mcmol/l (range 17.06-113.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nitrate level of the sAPS + SLE group was 49.81 +/- 27.54 and did not significantly differ from APS (33.67 +/- 14.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By univariate standard analyses, serum nitrate concentration was significantly higher in patients with high disease activity (57.31 +/- 25.12 vs. 25.62 +/- 6.96, Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Spearman correlation coefficient of nitrate level with SLEDAI was 0.8 (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A nitrate level is increased in patients with active SLE and in APS patients with severe thrombotic complication </plain></SENT>
