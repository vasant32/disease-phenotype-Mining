<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There remains, however, a group of patients with raised <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> levels who do not have any other well defined disease, but do have clinical features associated with these raised antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical, haematological, and serological features of 20 such patients are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> levels were measured by a solid phase assay for anticardiolipin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had raised IgG <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, 12 had raised IgM, and six had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 19 had raised antinuclear antibody levels; however, non fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and five of definite or presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>-for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 female patients who underwent pregnancy, 12 experienced fetal loss with up to eight abortions each (mean 3.6) </plain></SENT>
