<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies (a beta 2 GP-I) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a beta 2 GP-I by Western blot, dot blot, and ELISA in the sera of 15 patients with primary APS with high titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM) anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) at the time of study and compared findings with the sera of 13 aCL positive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> and 76 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera were also inhibited with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> micelles and tested for aCL and a beta 2 GP-I activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients with primary APS but no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> patient or control subject had IgG to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-free beta 2 GP-I (p &lt; 0.0001) for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aCL activity was inhibited with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> micelles but this treatment had less effect on a beta 2 GP-I activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no IgM a beta 2 GP-I in any serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 14 patients had had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity; 8 of these had a beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with primary APS frequently have IgG a beta 2 GP-I that appear to differ from aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If aCL present in patients with primary APS actually react with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> induced neoepitope on beta 2 GP-I, as recently proposed, patients with primary APS have autoantibodies against 2 epitopes on beta 2 GP-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of a beta 2 GP-I in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> might also contribute to protection from developing the APS </plain></SENT>
