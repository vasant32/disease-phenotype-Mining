<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), who had had, between them, 28 fetal losses in 30 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 2 successful pregnancies had occurred 14 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had been followed for a mean of 20.5 months with a mean of 6.4 determinations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) before becoming pregnant again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial determinations of aPL continued to be done throughout pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with low dose aspirin only except for one who had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> added at the time of an impending abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had successful outcomes and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients who had pregnancy loss, as well as in those who had other obstetric incidents there were abrupt changes in IgG, but not in IgM, levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgG aPL in patients with successful outcomes tended either to decrease gradually or to remain stable throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with primary APS who had repeatedly unsuccessful pregnancies may show changes in their IgG levels during pregnancy that could indicate impending morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some of them low dose aspirin may prevent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
