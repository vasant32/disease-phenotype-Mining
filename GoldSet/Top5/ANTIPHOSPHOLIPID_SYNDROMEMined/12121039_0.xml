<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess the impact of thymus ubiquitin complex (TUC) on morphological changes within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) in pregnant rabbits with experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also compared the intensity of neuropathological appearance and serological markers of the APS treated with the TUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem neuropathological investigations were done in 47 female New Zealand rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The material was divided into 4 groups: Group I-23 pregnant animals with APS; Group II-7 pregnant rabbits with APS, treated with TUC; Group III-7 pregnant rabbits without APS, treated with TUC; Group IV (the control one)-110 pregnant animals without APS, untreated with TUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APS was induced by subcutaneous injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were two main abnormalities within the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> of pregnant rabbits, which could be a result of the APS: the thrombo-necrotic foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue, and perivascular or meningeal inflammatory infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It turned out that TUC application reduced the morphological abnormalities, but it did not eliminate them entirely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of cases with thrombo-necrotic changes was reduced by approximately 18%, while perivascular infiltrates by 36% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TUC application did not influence the meningeal infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The platelet count significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001), the activated partial thromboplastin time shortened (p &lt; 0.001), and the number of immunised animals, demonstrating positive immunofluorescence test, significantly decreased after the TUC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory changes within the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> are the integral component of the experimental model of APS in pregnant rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The TUC may decrease the inflammatory component of the APS in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory infiltrates seem to be more responsive to TUC application and parallel to APS serological improvement after treatment than necrotic changes </plain></SENT>
