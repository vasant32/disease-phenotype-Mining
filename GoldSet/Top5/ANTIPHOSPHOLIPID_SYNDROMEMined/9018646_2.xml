<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy in preventing fetal loss in women with circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and a previous history of adverse pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We identified 18 pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> who had a total of 59 prior pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these pregnancies, spontaneous first-trimester abortions occurred in 36 (61.0%); fetal demise after the first trimester occurred in 9 (15.2%); voluntary terminations were elected in seven (11.9%) pregnancies; and there were seven (11.9%) surviving infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During their next pregnancies, these patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and/or low-dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients delivered successfully between 33 and 39 weeks' gestation, resulting in a live birth rate of 77.8% and a pregnancy loss rate of 22.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed an association between the number of prior fetal losses, the anticardiolipin antibody titer and the fetal survival rate following therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two or more prior fetal losses and high autoantibody titer resulted in a fetal survival rate of 50-75% with varying therapeutic regimens and dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, an improved fetal survival rate of 75-100% was observed with less than two prior fetal losses and low-mid anticardiolipin antibody titer with the same therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therefore, the results of this study suggest that although pharmacologic prophylaxis improves the outcome of pregnancies complicated by circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, such an outcome is influenced by the number of prior fetal losses and the anticardiolipin antibody titer </plain></SENT>
