<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 402 patients were studied, including 179 SLE patients and 223 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCR-RLFP was used to determine the genotypes of the 4G/5G PAI-1 and -308 A/G TNF-α polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SLE patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) (n = 86) were compared with patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> (n = 93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> patients were divided into proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and non-proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> groups according to the results of the renal biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted in the genotype distributions or allele frequencies of these TNF-α and PAI-1 polymorphisms between SLE patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were higher numbers of criteria for SLE, more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> flares and higher damage scores in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> patients, but there were similar frequencies of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) positivity and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was noted for any studied variable between the proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and non-proliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> groups except for the presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences in the TNF-α and PAI-1 genotype distributions or allele frequencies between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the -308 A/G TNF-α and 4G/5G PAI-1 polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to SLE in an Argentinean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also did not find any association between the presence of any specific allele or genotype and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, no association was noted between either of the two polymorphisms and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
