<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who are refractory or intolerant to these therapies constitute an important therapeutic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody, can effectively deplete B-cells and is commonly used in B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is being increasingly used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, AIHA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was refractory to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was discarded in view of the high risk of thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic perioperative complications, due to the presence of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment with four weekly doses of rituximab the patients had a rapid and sustained response which allowed progressive tapering of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose to 5 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, IgM anticardiolipin titres decreased from &gt; 600 MPL to &lt; 100 MPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen further cases of warm AIHA in adults treated with rituximab have been reviewed, showing excellent tolerance and high response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rituximab may be considered prior to splenectomy in patients with refractory AIHA and high risk of complications following splenectomy </plain></SENT>
