<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factors (GMCSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) are defined as positive signals for pregnancy, since they support the process of trophoblast invasion and expansion and induce placental growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and IL-3 were shown to be effective in preventing the manifestations of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aspirin inhibits the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase in macrophages, which leads to a shift in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism toward the lipoxygenase pathway, and results in overproduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotrienes</z:chebi> are capable of stimulating IL-3 production in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine whether aspirin may exert its beneficial effect in APS not only by its ability to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> production and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">prostaglandin I2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) formation, but also by stimulating IL-3 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Splenocytes and macrophages from naive mice were cultured in vitro with low dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, was added to mixed cultures of splenocytes and macrophages containing low dose aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-3 production was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When splenocytes and macrophages were cultured in vitro with low dose aspirin (10 micrograms/ml), a marked stimulation of IL-3 production was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When NDGA was added to mixed cultures of splenocytes and macrophages containing low dose aspirin, it decreased the IL-3 production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher dose of aspirin did not affect the cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When splenocytes were incubated without the addition of exogenous macrophages, no stimulation of IL-3 production was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, when purified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotriene C4</z:chebi> was added, there was an increase of 71 and 261%, respectively, in the stimulation of IL-3 production (p &lt; 0/01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results were supported by in vivo studies, in which a higher serum IL-3 level was detected in mice fed low dose aspirin, compared to the control group and to mice fed a higher dose of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aspirin acts as a potent stimulator of IL-3 through its ability to raise <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> production, which induces production of IL-3 both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
