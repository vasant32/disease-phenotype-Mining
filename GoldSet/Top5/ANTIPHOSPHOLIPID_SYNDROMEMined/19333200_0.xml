<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or arterial occlusive events and fetal losses associated with elevated levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The presence of antinuclear, anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, and anticardiolipin antibodies were investigated in 60 consecutive children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> who were followed up in a single Hungarian center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Almost 50% (28/60) of the patients were ANA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve (20%) patients had moderate titer (1:160) of ANA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-C1q antibody was positive in 4 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them symptom free considering renal manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only 1 child had aCL antibody, while 6/43 patients were LAC positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five were also ANA positive among the LAC positive patients (4 children with moderate titer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibody positivity was not detected in this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical relevance of aPL tests in childhood are difficult to explain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present study, obviously lower total prevalence of aPLs (aCL and anti-beta2GPI) was observed in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> than in previously reported investigations (20-30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The higher amount of LAC-positive patients indicates that coagulation studies (LAC) should be included in the neuroimmunological assessment of suspected APS patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference between the results of serological and LAC studies could be explained by the possible positivity of other, uninvestigated antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The wide spectrum of detected immunological alterations highlight the importance of the participation of pediatric rheumatologists in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0391957" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">idiopathic epilepsy</z:e> or with secondary induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
