<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study using standardised diagnostic procedures in order to look for the specificity of patients referred to the vascular centre; moreover, we assayed anticardiolipin antibodies in these patients using double ELISA and compared its frequency to sex and age matched a control group of 50 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>124 patients (20 men), mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 35.5 yr, range 9-69 yr, had confirmed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety nine patients were found to have secondary phenomenon, 72% of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010834'>trophic changes</z:hpo> of fingers and/or toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies assay was positive in seven patients and four healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vascular diseases</z:e> constituted about 20%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> 50% of secondary cases, but SLE (17 cases) not a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (11 cases) was the most frequent clinical entity in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were only two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Buerger's disease</z:e> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as an underlying disease for vasospastic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded in the vascular medicine centre that there were a lot of patients with ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or other type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010834'>trophic changes</z:hpo>, and very little primary, benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's disease</z:e> cases; surprisingly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral arterial occlusive disease</z:e> was very seldom responsible for vasospastic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
