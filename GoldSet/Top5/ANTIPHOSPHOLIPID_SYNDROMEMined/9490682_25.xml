<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may be distinguished by analyzing the coagulation profiles generated by the comparison of the ratios of two coagulation tests, the Kaolin Clotting Time (KCT) and the dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time (dRVVT), commonly adopted for their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The KCT profile is caused by antiprothrombin antibodies, whereas anti-beta2-GPI antibodies are responsible for the dRVVT coagulation profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPL antibodies is frequently associated with acquired resistance to activated Protein C (APC-R), but limited information is available regarding the role of the different antibodies in its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the time-course of activated Factor V (FVa) generation and inactivation in the plasma of 42 patients with well-defined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent inhibitors of coagulation: 24 displayed the dRVVT coagulation profile, whereas the other 18 cases showed the KCT profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pooled plasma, the peak values of FVa (mean +/- standard deviation, [SD]: 16.307 +/- 4.372 U/mL) were reached in 4 to 5 minutes and an almost complete inactivation (0.088 +/- 0.123 U/mL) was obtained within 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At this time point, values of residual FVa exceeding 2 SD the mean of controls (0.344 U/mL) were considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients belonging to the KCT coagulation profile group reached the maximal amount of FVa in plasma (22.740 +/- 7.693 U/mL, P = not significant v controls) within 4 to 5 minutes; at 20 minutes, the residual amount of FVa in plasma ranged from 0 to 1.09 U/mL (0.293 +/- 0.298; P = .027), but it was found abnormal in only six of the 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time-course of FVa in plasma of patients belonging to the dRVVT coagulation profile group differed from that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in that the peak values (10.955 +/- 5.092 U/mL) were reached at 10 minutes and the amount of residual FVa at 20 minutes ranged from 0.320 to 14.450 U/ml (2.544 +/- 3.580 U/mL; P = .0191 v <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and P =  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0114 v KCT group patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty of the 24 patients belonging to the dRVVT profile group had an abnormal inactivation of FVa (chi2 = 0.001 v KCT group patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was experienced by 15 patients: an abnormal rate of FVa inactivation was found in 11 of them (73%) versus 15 of the 27 cases without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (56%) (x2 = 0.2556) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of affinity-purified IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent inhibitors of coagulation on the time-course of FVa generation and inactivation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI, but not antiprothrombin antibodies, hampered the inactivation of FVa by endogenous APC, thus reproducing the behavior of the original plasmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This effect was strictly beta2-GPI-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings confirm that anti-beta2-GPI antibodies identify patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent inhibitors of coagulation at increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and suggest acquired APC-R as a possible explanation of the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
