<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been published that antibeta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) antibodies, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity (LAC), highly correlate with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> against activated protein C (APC) is one of the proposed mechanisms responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated a possible correlation between a beta2-GPI-dependent LAC (titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> into an activated partial thromboplastin time-based assay) and increased APC resistance in a population of 22 plasma samples with LAC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven plasma samples that displayed a beta2-GPI-dependent LAC also showed increased APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only one of the 11 plasma samples with a beta2-GPI-independent LAC displayed increased APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a monoclonal antibeta2-GPI antibody and patient-purified immunoglobulin G (both with LAC activity) were diluted in plasma with/without protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies only displayed a beta2-GPI-dependent LAC in plasma in the presence of protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the principle of the beta2-GPI LAC-assay was based on increased resistance against protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surface plasmon resonance analysis was used to investigate binding between APC and beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed that beta2-GPI was able to bind APC directly, especially in the presence of a monoclonal antibeta2-GPI antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our observations show a direct correlation between a major clinical symptom of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>), a diagnostic assay (beta2-GPI-dependent LAC) and a potential mechanism responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (increased APC resistance) </plain></SENT>
