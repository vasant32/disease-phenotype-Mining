<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The updated guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) diagnosis indicate locally calculate the cut-off values of the index of circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (ICA) and the clotting time in seconds (s) for mixing studies and % of correction (%C) for confirmatory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assess sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPC) of the cut-off values obtained as the 99th percentile from 60 plasmas of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed 647 plasmas from patients studied in the last 3 years, and results were revaluated according to the new criteria and cut-off values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and three had LA, and 75 of them were under oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed three screening tests: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), diluted Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and dilute prothrombin time (dPT), and previous diagnosis was carried out using our home-made cut-off calculated by receiver operating characteristics curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reanalysed the mixing and confirmatory data of APTT/dRVVT, the tests selected in the new guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate SPC, 244 plasmas (160 OA and 84 congenital deficient patients) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Considering mixing studies, the cut-off values demonstrate that SEN of ICA-APTT was 94% and of clotting time in second (s) 83%, with an SPC of 77% and 84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For ICA-dRVVT, SEN was 72% and for clotting time in second (s) 77%, with SPC of 98% and 84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cut-off values for %C for confirmatory APTT show good SEN 82% and high SPC 96%; for confirmatory dRVVT lower SEN 77%, but a SPC of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of mixing and confirmatory tests interpreted according to the new guidelines can clearly differentiate LA from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
