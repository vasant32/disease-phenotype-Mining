<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PE or DFPP are limited by their non- or semiselective removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plasma components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Replacement fluids such as fresh frozen plasma and albumin are necessary during PE or DFPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and allergic reactions whenever such fluids are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IAPP is superior to PE and DFPP because it does not require any replacement fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There has been development of many adsorbent columns used for removing specific pathogenic substances, and patients with various kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e> have been treated with IAPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, IAPP can be applied only for certain diseases because of the limitations of the commercially available columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the development of new adsorption therapy may improve the high mortality and morbidity rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
