<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, Simplastin (Organon Teknika), a rabbit brain thromboplastin, diluted 1/500, is used in this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, human tissue thromboplastin obtained by recombinant DNA technology has become available and we have evaluated the usefulness of one such preparation, Innovin (Dade), for the detection of the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>dPTs, using several dilutions of Innovin were determined on plasmas from 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 15 patients with a well-documented LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dPT ratios, calculated as the individual result divided by the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, were statistically compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Innovin in dilutions from 1/100 onwards was found to be significantly more responsive to the LA than Simplastin (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) ranged from 1.05% to 14.8% with Innovin, versus 2.7%-24.3% with Simplastin (P &lt; 0.05); inter-assay CVs ranged from 5.6%-11.8% with Innovin, versus 4.2%-33.8% with Simplastin (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 316 consecutive plasma samples from non-anticoagulated patients, on which a LA determination was requested, showed a 100% sensitivity and a 96% specificity of the dPT performed with Innovin, as compared to 81% and 93% respectively for the dPT using Simplastin </plain></SENT>
