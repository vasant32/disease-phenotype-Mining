<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: No data regarding phenotypic assets of circulating lymphocytes in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) are reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Role of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (RSA) remains uncertain, while natural killer (NK)-cells are involved in RSA pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, patients affected with APS without RSA, APS with RSA and RSA without aPL were studied for NK-cell subpopulation to evaluate its role in abortive events typical of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NK-cell levels in peripheral blood of APS patients without RSA (n = 28) and in APS-RSA patients (n = 25) were evaluated by means of flow cytofluorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NK-cells levels were evaluated also in RSA without aPL associated with either <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> (n = 86), anatomic (n = 30) or idiopathic (n = 77) conditions and in 42 healthy women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High NK levels were found in 14/25 (56%) APS-RSA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one aborted before the 10th gestational week (GW), while among the remaining patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one aborted after the 10th GW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK mean levels were significantly higher in APS-RSA than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other conditions studied, including healthy subjects, except idiopathic RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the numbers and proportions of NK-cells are significantly higher in patients with RSA with APS than in APS without RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased numbers of NK-cells correlate with reduced gestational age at abortion in patients with APS-RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data lead to a hypothesis that NK-cells contribute to the development of RSA in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NK-cells might precipitate damage initiated by aPL or they might cause pathology in RSA independent of aPL </plain></SENT>
