<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histologic lesions of PAPS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> are vascular; among them <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>) is the most characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>It is still not clear in the literature whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> can be the unique manifestation of PAPS in the absence of other thrombotic processes; that is: do the renal microthrombotic lesions allow to make the diagnosis of PAPS in presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this purpose we present three clinical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> C4 hypocomplementemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and mitralic valve insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LAC and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies at high titre were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic picture was characterized by basement membrane reduplication and arteriolar mucoid degeneration, which are features of early phase of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies was performed several times and resulted positive three times, four months after the diagnosis as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The renal histologic features were consistent with late lesions of <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The third patient had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapidly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, tricuspidal valve insufficiency and two positive anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies determinations three weeks apart (in two occasions anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and in one occasion LAC as well were found) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The renal lesions were characteristic for <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion we think that patients with <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> can be considered affected by PAPS, as the thrombotic process is represented by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in preglomerular arterioles, which leads to <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
