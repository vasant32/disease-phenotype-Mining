<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that hereditary and acquired prothrombotic disorders are risk factors for VST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether children with AOM complicated VST have a prothrombotic tendency, which might have important therapeutic and preventive implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The files of children hospitalized at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, a tertiary referral center, from 1999 to 2002, because of AOM complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and VST were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children underwent laboratory work-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven children met the study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, five had prothrombotic disorders, namely elevated levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (Lp[a]) (n = 4), antibodies to beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) (n = 4), and heterozygosity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One child had three abnormalities, two children had two abnormalities, and two children had one abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A prothrombotic tendency may exist in children with AOM complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and VST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate its extent </plain></SENT>
