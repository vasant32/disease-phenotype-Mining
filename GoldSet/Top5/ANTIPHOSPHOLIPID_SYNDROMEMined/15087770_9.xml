<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy in this high-risk patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Of nine APAS renal-transplant patients, seven were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi>, whereas two were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the two patients treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, one had early allograft loss, whereas the other patient is doing fine at 5 years posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the seven 7 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi>, two patients are doing well at 2 and 3 years posttransplant, two had early allograft loss, the remaining three patients returned to dialysis after they were taken off of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> at 6, 12, and 20 months posttransplant because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation therapy is beneficial to some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APAS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications are a serious side effect of this therapy </plain></SENT>
