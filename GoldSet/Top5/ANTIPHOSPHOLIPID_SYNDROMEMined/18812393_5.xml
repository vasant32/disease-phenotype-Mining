<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recruitment criteria were age 18-65 years, no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, positivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or IgG/IgM anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) on &gt; or =2 occasions at least 6 weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, laboratory and clinical parameters were collected at enrolment and at the time of the thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 370 patients/subjects (mean (SD) age 34 (9.9) years) were analysed retrospectively for a mean (SD) follow-up of 59.3 (45.5) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (8.1%) developed a first thrombotic event during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and medium/high levels of IgG aCL were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis as independent risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thromboprophylaxis during high-risk and long-term periods was significantly protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> or medium/high titres of IgG aCL are risk factors for a first thrombotic event in asymptomatic aPL carriers and primary prophylaxis is protective </plain></SENT>
