<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the importance of assaying for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL) antibodies other than anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies in patients with putative anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), 1,513 serum samples from over 399 patients with the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> were tested for IgM, IgG or IgA class antibodies to the following <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17517">phosphatidylglycerol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16337">phosphatidic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-specific binding was subtracted from total binding of antibodies to each PL to eliminate false positive ELISA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only patients whose sera contained antibody levels which were greater than three standard deviations above the means were considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who were positive for anti-PL antibody had antibodies to at least one of six <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 60% of the positive samples contained antibodies to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For IgG class, antibodies to phosphatidylserine were the most prevalent followed by antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody analysis should be performed for more than anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody to detect patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
