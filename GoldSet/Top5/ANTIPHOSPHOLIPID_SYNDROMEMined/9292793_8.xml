<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, course, and management of serious hemorrhagic complications of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of patients identified with serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications from anticoagulation for APS were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients included 6 women and one man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and one woman with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had 3 separate hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 6 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> in 5 patients, one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo> with tamponade, one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo>, and one episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0004834'>ovarian hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, symptoms related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were initially attributed to active SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of anticoagulation was between one month and 10 years at the time of bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>International normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time were above the intended range in 6/9 episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no permanent sequelae due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was resumed in 6/7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The management of APS must include vigilance, patient education, and anticoagulation to maintain the INR between 3 and 3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To prevent hemorrhagic complications, low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is an option that deserves further study </plain></SENT>
