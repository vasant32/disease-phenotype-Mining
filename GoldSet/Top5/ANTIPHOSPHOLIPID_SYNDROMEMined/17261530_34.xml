<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgGs from two patients with APS, one with aPL negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum (NHS), were evaluated for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, tissue factor (TF) activity and endothelial cell activation in LPS-/- mice displaying a tlr4 spontaneous mutation vs LPS responsive (LPS+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human tlr4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms were evaluated by allele-specific PCR in 110 patients with APS with arterial/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and in 220 controls of the same ethnic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG-APS produced significantly larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and more leucocytes (WBC) adhering to endothelial cells in the cremaster muscle microcirculation of LPS+/+ mice than IgG-NHS or aPL negative SLE-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects were abrogated after absorption of the anti-beta(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I activity by an affinity column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two IgG-APS induced significantly smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and fewer WBC adhering to endothelial cells in LPS-/- mice than in LPS+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG-APS induced higher TF activity in carotid artery homogenates of LPS+/+ mice than in LPS-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile tlr4 polymorphisms was significantly lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings in LPS-/- mice and the reduction in the "protective" polymorphism in patients with APS with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> suggest that TLR-4 is involved in the interaction of aPL with endothelial cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
