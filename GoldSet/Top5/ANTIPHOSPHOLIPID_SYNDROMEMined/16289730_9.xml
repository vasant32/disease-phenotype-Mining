<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The epithelium of the human placenta comprises an inner cytotrophoblast (CT) which proliferates and fuses with the outer differentiated syncytiotrophoblast (ST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Turnover has been studied focussing on second and third trimester placentas but with a paucity of data describing the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> first trimester trophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the nuclear CT:ST ratio in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological pregnancy and thus establish the relationship between cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast nuclear number during early gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Archival first trimester material from placentas from healthy pregnancy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome) was stained with H&amp;E, cytokeratin-7 and Mib-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of trophoblast as a fraction of total villous area was calculated and the number of sectioned cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast nuclei as well as the number of proliferating cytotrophoblast was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> features of trophoblast development during the first trimester (rise in trophoblast area, increase in number of syncytiotrophoblast nuclei, increase in number of proliferating cytotrophoblast, decrease in the nuclear CT:ST ratio) are absent/reversed in tissues from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (decreasing trophoblast area, constant number of syncytiotrophoblast nuclei, decreasing number of proliferating trophoblast, constant nuclear CT:ST ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proliferation of cytotrophoblast in early gestation provides a pool of trophoblast stem cells critical for ongoing placental development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Premature cytotrophoblast differentiation in favour of syncytial fusion results in deficiencies of cytotrophoblast and rarification of villous trophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal trophoblast differentiation in early gestation may be due to a premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of maternal perfusion of the placenta and may be a likely antecedent for conditions associated with failure of placentation such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
