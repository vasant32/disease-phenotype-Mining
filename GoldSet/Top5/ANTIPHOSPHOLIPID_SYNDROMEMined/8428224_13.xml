<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incubation with IgG from the combined patient group resulted in a significantly greater release of vWF (mean stimulation index +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 4.57 +/- 0.78) when compared with controls (1.96 +/- 0.22, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IgG from 17 patients who had had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced higher levels of vWF release (5.33 +/- 1.09) when compared with the controls (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that IgG from patients with SLE or APS is capable of stimulating vWF release and that this ability may be implicated in the thrombotic events that are observed in these conditions </plain></SENT>
