<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA DRB1, DQB1 and DQA1 genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers in 83 Caucasoid British patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequencies were compared between subgroups of patients and 177 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DQB1*0604/5/6/7/9-DQA1*0102-DRB1*1302 and DQB1*0303-DQA1*0201-DRB1*0701 haplotypes showed significantly positive correlations with APS [P=0.0087 and P=0.0012, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of the former was enhanced in primary APS patients with anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta 2GPI) [odds ratio 6.2, 95% confidence interval (2.2-17.6), P=0.0014, corrected P=0.042] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These alleles and haplotypes might affect anti-ss2GPI production and APS development in different and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> fashion </plain></SENT>
