<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The plasma protein beta2GPI (beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I) has been proposed to mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and to play a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggestion is based mainly on the presumption that beta2GPI has an appreciable interaction with PS (phosphatidylserine)-exposing cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, quantitative data on the binding of beta2GPI to PS-exposing cells under physiologically relevant conditions are scarce and conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore we evaluated the binding of beta2GPI to PS-expressing blood platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry showed that binding of beta2GPI is negligible at physiological ionic strength, in contrast with significant binding occurring at low ionic strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding parameters of beta2GPI and (for comparison) prothrombin were quantified by ellipsometric measurement of protein <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> from the supernatant following incubation with platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At low ionic strength (20 mM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>), a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.2 microM was found for beta2GPI, with 7.4x10(5) binding sites per platelet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under physiologically relevant conditions (120 mM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> and 3 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>), binding of beta2GPI was not detectable (extrapolated K(d)&gt;80 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin binding (at 3 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>) was much less affected by ionic strength: K(d) values of 0.5 and 1.4 muM were observed at 20 and 120 mM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low affinity and the presence of many <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-binding proteins in plasma that can compete with the binding of beta2GPI suggest that only a small fraction (&lt;5%) of the binding sites on PS-exposing blood cells are likely to be occupied by beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in relation to the alleged (patho-)physiological functions of beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
