<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Complement C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, is a candidate target molecule for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, RA, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, up until now, no specific contribution of C5a and its receptor, C5aR, was recognized in diseases of antibody-dependent type II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we identify C5a as a novel key mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) and show that mice lacking C5aR are partially resistant to this IgG autoantibody-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon administration of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, upregulation of activating Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaRs) on Kupffer cells, as observed in WT mice, was absent in C5aR-deficient mice, and FcgammaR-mediated in vivo erythrophagocytosis was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, in mice deficient in FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIII, anti-erythrocyte antibody-induced C5 and C5a production was abolished, demonstrating the existence of a previously unidentified FcgammaR-mediated C5a-generating pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that the development of a full-blown antibody-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> requires C5a--produced by and acting on FcgammaR--and may suggest therapeutic benefits of C5 and/or C5a/C5aR blockade in AIHA and other diseases closely related to type II autoimmune injury </plain></SENT>
