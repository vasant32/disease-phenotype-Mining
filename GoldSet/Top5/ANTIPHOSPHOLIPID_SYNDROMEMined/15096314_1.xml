<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decision should be made on an individual basis until further studies become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special consideration for preventive antithrombotic treatment should be given to patients with persistent high titers of immunoglobulin G APLs, which require protein cofactor for detection, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, or left-sided cardiac valve lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-level oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is still the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) with or without SLE or with cardiac valvular lesions </plain></SENT>
