<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> of unknown origin (cryptogenic) was diagnosed in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations of 5,10-methylenetetrahydropholate reductase (MTGPR), prothrombin, and coagulation factor V genes were documented by PCR in 38, 0, 3% of D cases, 55.9, 9, 13% of APS cases, 73, 9, 0 CE cases, 57, 5, 0% of cases with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with 43, 0, 0% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in MTGPR gene in CE cases, prothrombin gene in APS and CE cases, coagulation factor V gene in APS cases occurred more frequently than in control (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
