<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its recently recognized role in several <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp>, we have developed a method that quantifies plasma beta2GPI levels by using a competitive ELISA assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When combined with data from a standard ELISA, this method determines the concentration of free beta2GPI and the fraction of antibody-bound beta2GPI thereby facilitating quantification of total antigen in individuals with autoimmune antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard competitive inhibition ELISA was compared with this method, which uses known amounts of standard beta2GPI added to the plasma as an internal standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identical results were obtained with both methods for plasma samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals that did not contain blocking antibodies </plain></SENT>
