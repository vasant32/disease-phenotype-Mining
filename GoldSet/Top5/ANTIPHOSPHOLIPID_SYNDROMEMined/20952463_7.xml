<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have found a high prevalence of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency and associations of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in a cohort of patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: anti-ß(2)-GPI was measured in 796 patients with SLE (93% women, 53% white, 38% African American, mean age 45 yrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI (&gt; 20 phospholipid units) was found in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a cohort database, associations with cumulative thrombotic and other manifestations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: of patients with SLE who demonstrated IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI positivity, about 6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (p = 0.070), 4% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (p = 0.647), 20% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.003), 4% had other <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.827), 12% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p = 0.050), and 1% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (p = 0.397) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IgG anti-ß(2)-GPI has the strongest association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI was more strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than was IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that assessment of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in SLE, and that the classification criteria for APS should be revised to include IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
