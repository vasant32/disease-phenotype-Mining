<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the significance of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)], a risk factor for atherothrombosis, and its relationship with fibrinolysis in a cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of Lp(a) were measured in 68 patients with APS (42 primary, 26 secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) were found in patients with APS compared to 22 healthy controls (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significance persisted after comparing Lp(a) levels in 3 APS subgroups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, n = 37; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, n = 31; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, n = 24) with those of controls (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS with maximal elevation of Lp(a) showed a lower fibrinolytic activity (lower D-dimer and higher plasminogen activator inhibitor) than patients whose Lp(a) was within a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Lp(a) may represent a marker of APS and that Lp(a) has a negative effect on the fibrinolytic system that might contribute to the thrombotic tendency of APS </plain></SENT>
