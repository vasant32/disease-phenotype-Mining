<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequency of autoantibodies with high specificity remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients with definite IE were studied for low specificity (rheumatoid factor [RF], <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, anti-ribonucleoproteins (anti-RNP) anticardiolipin [aCL], and anti-β2 glycoprotein 1) and high specificity (anti-cyclic citrullinated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> [anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCPs</z:chebi>], anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, anti-Sm, anti-Scl70, and anticentromere) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of RF was 68%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, 47%; aCL/IgG, 58%; aCL/IgM, 47%; anti-β2 glycoprotein 1/IgG, 5%; and anti-Ro/SSA, 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>-related antibodies in high titers, one of them also having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> (1 patient), other highly specific antibodies were absent.Rheumatoid factor of 100 UI/mL or greater and multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> were independently associated with in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should need to be aware about the common presence of a variety of antibodies with low specificity but also the exceptional occurrence of anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies in IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Special attention to multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> and high RF is also suggested </plain></SENT>
