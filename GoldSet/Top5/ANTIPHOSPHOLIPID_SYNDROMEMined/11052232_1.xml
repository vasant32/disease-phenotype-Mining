<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I found an increase in soluble thrombomodulin one to two months before the crisis in eight of ten patients including three with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005520'>chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> syndrome and one patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease was found after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other tested parameters did not respond as soluble thrombomodulin, and they were not useful for predicting the crisis one to two months before the crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility that soluble thrombomodulin might be an important factor in predicting thrombotic crisis </plain></SENT>
