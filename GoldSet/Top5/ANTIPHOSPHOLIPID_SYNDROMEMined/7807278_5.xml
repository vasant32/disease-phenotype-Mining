<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into three groups on the basis of their medical history, and analysis of data of individual groups revealed that the incidence of beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL was significantly higher in patients who had experienced at least one fetal loss in the second or third trimester </plain></SENT>
