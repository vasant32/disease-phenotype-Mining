<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-chromatin antibodies have recently been described in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and it has been suggested that their presence is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and clinical associations of these antibodies in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of anti-chromatin antibodies in 100 patients with SLE was investigated by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the specificity of these antibodies, 100 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>, 30 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), 10 with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, and 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive levels were detected in 69/100 (69%) patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, they were found in only 8/100 (8%) of those with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>, in 1/10 (10%) with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, in 2/30 (7%) with primary APS, and in none of the 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with anti-chromatin antibodies had a twofold higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than those without these antibodies (58% v 29%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between the levels of anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity score as measured by the European Consensus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Activity Measurement (ECLAM; p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of anti-chromatin antibodies appears to be a useful addition to the laboratory tests that can help in the diagnosis and treatment of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These antibodies are both sensitive and specific for SLE, and are a useful marker for an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
