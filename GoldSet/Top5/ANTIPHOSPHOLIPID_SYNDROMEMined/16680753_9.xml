<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate possible differences of APLA between these two disorders, we assayed IgG and IgM APLA by ELISA in 21 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and 33 with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The APLA reacting against two protein target antigens, beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta2GP1) and FVII/VIIa, and four <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> (PE)] as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We made the following observations: (i) IgG and IgM antibodies to beta2GP1 and IgM antibodies to FVII/VIIa were more common in APS than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.05, while IgG antibodies against the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> (aCL, aPC, aPS, aPE) were more common in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> than APS, P &lt; 0.05; (ii) multiple APLA &gt; or =3 antigens) were more frequent in APS than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, P &lt; 0.05; (iii) LA was frequently associated with APS but was absent in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>; (iv) APLA is quite common in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>: two-thirds were positive for at least one APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In summary, APLA are prevalent in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> but their profile differs from APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In APS, antibodies were predominantly against beta2GP1 and 80% had positive LA, while in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> the APLA reacted most often with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> without LA </plain></SENT>
