<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was excluded on the basis of both clinical and serological criteria, and the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two cases, aCL antibodies could be causally related to a presumed immune-mediated thrombotic event involving the basal ganglia as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patient the finding of white matter alteration on NMR might be due to cross-reactivity of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (aPL) antibodies with cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that PAPS must always be considered when isolated or recurrent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, and particularly hemidystonia, occur in childhood </plain></SENT>
