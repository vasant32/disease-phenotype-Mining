<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) are found in a large percentage of patients with primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify the prevalence and clinical correlation of these antibodies in patients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), in comparison to anticardiolipin (aCL) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether serial samples improve clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples for anti-beta2-GPI (IgG, IgM, IgA), aCL (IgG, IgM, IgA), and LAC (by dilute Russell viper venom time; RVVT) were collected from 418 consecutive patients with SLE or APS between October 2002 and March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and serologic data of these patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 185 (44.5%) patients were positive for anti-beta2-GPI, 55.3% were positive for aCL, and 31.1% for LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI was more common in Caucasians than in African Americans (p = 0.098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgM and IgA were the most frequent isotypes of anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>aCL and anti-beta2-GPI were highly associated (p &lt; 0.0001 to p = 0.0177, depending on isotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive association was found between the presence of the LAC by dilute RVVT and anti-beta2-GPI IgG (p &lt; 0.0001), IgM (p &lt; 0.0001), and IgA (p = 0.0002) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistent positivity increased the association of venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> with anti-beta2-GPI (IgG and IgM isotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> were not associated with anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-beta2-GPI was not significantly associated with any manifestation of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anti-beta2-GPI IgM and IgA was very high in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Measurement of anti-beta2-GPI IgG is clinically useful in identifying patients with SLE at higher risk for venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Persistent positivity increased the association of IgG anti-beta2-GPI with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and anti-beta2-GPI IgM with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-beta2-GPI was not significantly associated with APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
