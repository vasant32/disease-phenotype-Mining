<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of main hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> in Brazilian children and adolescents diagnosed with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (PVT) without associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 32 children with PVT in accompaniment at Hospital das Cl√≠nicas of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais from January 1990 to July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> was performed from September 2010 to July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were evaluated; 59% were boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 2.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean time of patients' accompaniment was between 4.7 and 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of hereditary and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo> occurred in 34.4% of patients, and 9 of them also showed other risk factors in the previous history evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were absent in the previous history of 18 patients (56.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed persistent high titres of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient was heterozygous for factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (34.4%) showed heterozygous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T, and no patient had the JAK2V617F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even after investigation of main hereditary and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, PVT remains without apparent cause in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, association of local and systemic risk factors seems to be important also in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite the low prevalence, a complete investigation, which includes both hereditary and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilias</z:hpo>, may be necessary </plain></SENT>
