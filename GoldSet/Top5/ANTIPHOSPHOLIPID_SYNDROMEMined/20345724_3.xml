<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore they are widely measured and about 30 commercial kits are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the analytical and clinical performances of four fully automated, chemiluminescent assays: HemosIL AcuStar aCL IgG, HemosIL AcuStar aCL IgM, HemosIL AcuStar abeta(2)GPI IgG, and HemosIL AcuStar abeta(2)GPI IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cut-off values were assessed by testing 250 blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total coefficients of variation (CV) were determined with six plasma pools and two controls ranging from 4.3 to 2694 U mL(-1) depending on the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples from 218 well-characterized patients and 103 controls were measured in three laboratories to determine inter-laboratory variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the 321 samples were compared with three commercial assays (REAADS, INOVA and VARELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cut-off values were assigned to 20 arbitrary units for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total CV ranged from 4.3 to 11.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No interference of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> and rheumatoid factor was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inter-laboratory variability was low and no sample changed status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall status agreement between HemosIL assays and the comparator kits ranged from 82 to 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, agreement when predicting APS and the odds ratios when predicting a thrombotic or obstetric event gave comparable results between HemosIL AcuStar and the three other assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the fully automated HemosIL AcuStar aPL assay panel showed similar performances to the three commercial ELISAs commonly used by various laboratories to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
