<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: D-dimer is considered a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> and of endogenous fibrinolysis, so increased d-dimer is detectable in patients affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, several studies showed that also <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, in particular secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> due to recurrent fetal losses, has been often related to thrombotic events, in particular in women carrying thrombotic risk factors such as inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (MTHFRC677T, PTHRA20210G, Factor V Leiden polimorphisms and/or inhAfter this screening we selected 39erited protein C, protein S, AT III deficiency) or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, acquired protein C, protein S, AT III deficiency, drugs induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because its high predictive negative value in case of suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, increased d-dimer has been often associated to subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the role of d-dimer as first marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in women affected by unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> and subsequently to search the cause of increased d-dimer, such as inherited and/or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 79 patients with unexplained primary or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded 40 patients affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0009069'>hydrosalpinx</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000131'>uterine fibroids</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000130'>uterine malformations</z:hpo>, endocrinological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunological diseases</z:e>, luteal insufficiency, cytogenetical alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining 39 patients were tested for d-dimer and divided in two groups: the patients of group A (25 patients) showed increased plasma d-dimer, in group B were included 14 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma level of d-dimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After this step <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 39 patients were screened for MTHFRC677T, PTHRA20210G, Factor V Leiden polimorphisms, protein C, protein S, AT III, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group were included 15 age matched women without <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp> problems referred to our outpatient's section of vascular medicine for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>.Statistical analysis was based on chi2 test, differences were considered to be significant if p &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: D-dimer was increased in 25/39 and 20/25 showed inherited/acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> while patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> d-dimer showed inherited/acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in 7/14 (p: &lt; 0.05, s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: D-dimer is a well known marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, in particular its high predictive negative value in case of suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been recognised by several reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Yet, increased d-dimer has been identified also for subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> besides for vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data, in fact, for the first time suggest an interesting role of d-dimer to identify women affected by unexplained primary or secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>So, probably there is a role for d-dimer in these subjects for its predictive positive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of course, further data on large based population are needed to confirm our results, because these findings may speed up a diagnostic screening in these patients also for a good cost/effectiveness of this test </plain></SENT>
