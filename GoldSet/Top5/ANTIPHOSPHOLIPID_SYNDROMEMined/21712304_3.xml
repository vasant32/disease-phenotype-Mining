<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum from 137 patients with primary APS, APS associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> other than APS from five EU rheumatology centres were tested for anti-β2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 109 patients who were sera positive for anti-β2-GPI by the in-house anti-β2-GPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the Immunology Laboratory, UMC Ljubljana were selected for further testing on avidity with chaotropic anti-β2-GPI ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High, low and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> avidity IgG anti-β2-GPI was found in 32/109, 17/109 and 60/109 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients with APS were in the high avidity than in the low avidity anti-β2-GPI group, while the opposite was observed for non-APS (both p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical feature among patients with high avidity anti-β2-GPI was <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, versus low avidity anti-β2-GPI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with or without APS had anti-β2-GPI of high, low or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> avidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High avidity anti-β2-GPI was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and APS, while in the low avidity anti-β2-GPI group non-APS (predominantly SLE) patients prevailed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Determination of anti-β2-GPI avidity should be considered in the analytical strategies for further differentiation of patients with anti-β2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
