<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that platelet activation by autoantibody may be a pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied IgG binding, microparticle (mp) formation and P-selectin expression by flow cytometry in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets after incubation in serum from 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and that from 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of platelet-associated IgG were significantly higher after incubation in patient sera (mean 17.2, range 2.0-75.0%) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera (mean 2.0, range 1.2-3.7%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets in serum led to increased microparticle formation (P&lt;0.01) and P-selectin expression (P &lt; 0.05), compared with unstimulated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference, however, between microparticle formation nor P-Selectin expression induced by patient serum (mp 3.0 (1.6-5.0)%; P-selectin 8.0 (4.0-16.6)%) versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum (mp 3.2 (2.1-4.5)%; P-selectin 10.1 (4.0-15.6); median (range)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-activation of platelets with sub-threshold <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> concentrations or thrombin receptor activator <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> resulted in a small increase in microparticle formation, but there was still no significant difference between the effects of patient and control sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of platelet membrane binding IgG in serum from 5/11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, there was no evidence for associated enhanced platelet-activating ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study supports antiplatelet reactivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, but not a direct platelet-activating role for platelet-directed autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
