<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, levels of in vivo platelet activation were measured in 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients (14 of whom had secondary APS) using sensitive flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soluble P-selectin levels were also assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet CD63 expression was significantly higher in PAPS than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P = 0.007), as well as SLE patients with and without secondary APS (P = 0.03 and P = 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAC-1 binding was significantly higher in PAPS than the control group (P = 0.007) and SLE patients without APS (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet-leucocyte complexes were significantly higher in SLE patients than both PAPS and the control group, and platelet-monocyte complexes were significantly increased in PAPS compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(Platelet-leucocyte complexes were also significantly higher than controls in 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients without <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Soluble P-selectin levels were significantly higher in PAPS and SLE patients than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet CD62p expression, annexin V binding and platelet microparticle numbers were not increased in PAPS or SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is evidence of increased platelet activation in PAPS and SLE, and this is important to note as it may have potential therapeutic implications with respect to use of antiplatelet agents in these patients </plain></SENT>
