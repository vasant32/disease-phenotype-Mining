<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy during pregnancy is challenging because of the potential for both fetal and maternal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This guideline focuses on the management of VTE and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> as well as the use of antithrombotic agents during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The methods of this guideline follow the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recommend low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnant women instead of unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (Grade 1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> VTE, we suggest that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> be continued for at least 6 weeks postpartum (for a minimum duration of therapy of 3 months) compared with shorter durations of treatment (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For women who fulfill the laboratory criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (APLA) syndrome and meet the clinical APLA criteria based on a history of three or more pregnancy losses, we recommend antepartum administration of prophylactic or intermediate-dose unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or prophylactic low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> combined with low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg/d) over no treatment (Grade 1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For women with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e>, we suggest not to use antithrombotic prophylaxis (Grade 2C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For women with two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> but without APLA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, we recommend against antithrombotic prophylaxis (Grade 1B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most recommendations in this guideline are based on observational studies and extrapolation from other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need for appropriately designed studies in this population </plain></SENT>
