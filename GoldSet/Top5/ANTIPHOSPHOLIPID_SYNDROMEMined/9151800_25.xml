<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain groups of aCLs (anti-beta2GPI antibodies) exert <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity and perturb the function of vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation aimed at highlighting some insights into the molecular basis by which aCLs exert their biological effects by using anti-beta2GPI mAbs with well-characterized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> from mice and from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI mAbs directed against the third domain (Cof-20 and Cof-22) and fourth domain (Cof-21, EY1C8, and EY2C9) of beta2GPI inhibited the thrombin generation induced by Russell's viper venom in diluted plasma and that induced by the prothrombinase complex reconstituted with purified clotting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity was abrogated in the presence of an excess amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, thus resembling the LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In stark contrast, anti-beta2GPI mAbs directed against the fifth domain and the carboxy-terminal region of the fourth domain showed no LA-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the LA activity of anti-beta2GPI antibodies depends on their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments carried out to clarify the mechanism of the LA activity showed that anti-beta2GPI mAbs with LA-like activity, but not those without this effect, enhance the beta2GPI binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fab' fragment, of the anti-beta2GPI mAbs was found to enhance the LA activity and the beta2GPI binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, suggesting that anti-beta2GPI antibodies induce formation of multiple complexes of beta2GPI on the surface of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> because of their bivalent property </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This clustering of beta2GPI molecules induced by anti-beta2GPI antibodies, probably because of their multivalent property and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity, might hinder the lateral mobility and activation of clotting factors on the surface of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and thus exert LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clustering of beta2GPI molecules may also explain the molecular mechanism by which anti-beta2GPI antibodies alter the function of leukocytes and endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The well-documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> LA activity of aCLs (anti-beta2GPI antibodies) may also be explained by their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity </plain></SENT>
