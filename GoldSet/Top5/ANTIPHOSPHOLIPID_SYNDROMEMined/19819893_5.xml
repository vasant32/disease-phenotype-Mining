<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Increased peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cell activity has been associated with unexplained reproductive failure including recurrent (three or more) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> (RM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have reported abnormalities in both numbers (absolute and proportion) and activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed numerous NK cell parameters to determine which (if any) are altered in women with RM compared with controls, which parameter best differentiated women with RM from controls, and what NK levels should be considered high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Luteal-phase blood samples from women with RM (n = 104) and controls (n = 33) were analysed by four-colour flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NK cells were analysed as a percentage of lymphocytes, total NK concentration, CD56(Dim) subtype concentration and percentage, activated CD69(+)CD56(Dim) subtype concentration and percentage and CD56(+Bright):CD56(+Dim) subtype ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with RM were analysed in two subgroups: those positive in &gt; or =1 RM screening tests (karyotype, uterine, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>) (n = 48) and those who had negative screening tests (n = 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Women with RM had significantly higher NK percentage (P &lt; 0.001), and significantly lower CD56(+Bright):CD56(+Dim) ratio (P &lt; 0.05) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK percentage was the only significantly higher variable in the RM screening test negative subgroup (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A ROC analysis (AUC = 0.71) found that an NK percentage &gt;18% was highly specific for women with RM (97.0%), and defined 12.5% of women with RM as having high NK percentage, compared with 2.9% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Women with RM have altered peripheral blood NK parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NK cells as a percentage of lymphocytes best discriminated RM and control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women with RM and high NK levels may have an immunological disorder </plain></SENT>
