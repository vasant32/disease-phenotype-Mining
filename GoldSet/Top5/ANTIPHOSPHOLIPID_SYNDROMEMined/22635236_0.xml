<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The laboratory criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are based on detection of anticardiolipin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or to antiÎ²2- <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I but currently a significance of other multiple aPL is being discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of their vascular and neuroinflammatory effect aPL, if being transplacentally transferred, might inflict damage in developing organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the occurrence of eight selected aPL in offspring of mothers with proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> with aPL positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible influence of aPL presence on clinical, ultrasound and laboratory outcome of children was observed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prospective study included 38 women: 17 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and 21 women with other diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> with detected aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also included were 39 children born to the above mentioned mothers between January 2009 and April 2010 in Perinatology Centre in Pilsen, Czech Republic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 30 mothers without AD and their 30 healthy singletons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of the study showed the presence of aPL in 42.1% neonates of aPL positive mothers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, six month later aPL were present in only 37.5 % of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Observed occurrence of aPL positivity at 6 months of age in originally negative offspring could be attributed to vaccination or food exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Psychomotor development of children has proceeded without major deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study continues and will evaluate both groups of children at two years of age </plain></SENT>
