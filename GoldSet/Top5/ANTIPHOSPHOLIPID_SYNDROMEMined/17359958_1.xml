<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There are controversial reports on the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we aimed to determine the frequency and clinical importance of aPL isotypes in Turkish patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with SLE and 41 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum aPL levels were measured both in patients and healthy subjects by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen of the patients with SLE had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (25.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of anticardiolipin antibody (aCL)-positive SLE patients among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least one isotype of anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) antibody was positive in 83% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positivity rates of aCL and anti-beta(2)-GPI antibodies in patients with or without APS were higher than the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were positive correlations between isotypes of IgM aCL, IgG and IgM anti-beta(2)-GPI and manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems that the isotypes of IgM aCL, IgG and IgM anti-beta(2)-GPI are correlated with manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They may play a role in pathogenesis and may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
