<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: β2GPI is a major antigen for autoantibodies associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only the dimeric form of β2GPI generated by anti-β2GPI antibodies is pathologically important, in contrast to monomeric β2GPI which is abundant in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We created a dimeric inhibitor, A1-A1, to selectively target β2GPI in β2GPI/antibody complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To make this inhibitor, we isolated the first ligand-binding module from ApoER2 (A1) and connected two A1 modules with a flexible linker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A1-A1 interferes with two pathologically important interactions in APS, the binding of β2GPI/antibody complexes with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and ApoER2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficiency of A1-A1 to monomeric A1 for inhibition of the binding of β2GPI/antibody complexes to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We tested the inhibition of ��2GPI present in human serum, β2GPI purified from human plasma and the individual domain V of β2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that when β2GPI/antibody complexes are formed, A1-A1 is much more effective than A1 in inhibition of the binding of β2GPI to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, regardless of the source of β2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, A1-A1 strongly inhibits the binding of dimerized domain V of β2GPI to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> compared to the monomeric A1 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the absence of anti-β2GPI antibodies, both A1-A1 and A1 only weakly inhibit the binding of pathologically inactive monomeric β2GPI to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the approach of using a dimeric inhibitor to block β2GPI in the pathological multivalent β2GPI/antibody complexes holds significant promise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The novel inhibitor A1-A1 may be a starting point in the development of an effective therapeutic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
