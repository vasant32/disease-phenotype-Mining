<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (APLA) and anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) in the pathogenesis of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in the reported involvement of APLA may be due, in part, to the polyclonal nature of these antibodies and the use of serum and serum fractions for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To circumvent this issue, we generated monoclonal antibodies (MAB) from three patients with APS and two healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then compared the antigen binding patterns and the heavy chain variable region (VH) DNA sequences of the MAB derived from patients with APS to those from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that APLA and AECA comprise a highly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population of antibodies with respect to the antigens they recognize, as well as VH gene usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAB derived from patients with APS do not differ from those derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals based on either antigen recognition or VH gene usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the importance of additional predisposing factors in the pathogenesis of APS </plain></SENT>
