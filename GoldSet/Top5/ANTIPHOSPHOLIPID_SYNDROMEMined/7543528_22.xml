<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is considerable controversy as to the exact nature of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> to which these Abs are directed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>mAb derived from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> bound to CL only in the presence of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that span the fifth C-terminal domain of beta 2GPI supported the binding of one of the mAbs to CL in a beta 2GPI-free system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> possessed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding sequence Cys281-Lys<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi>-Lys-Glu-Lys-Lys-Cys288 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the mAbs bound to beta 2GPI that had been adsorbed on gamma-irradiated microtiter plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binding to beta 2GPI was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from the carboxyl-terminal end of beta 2GPI and soluble beta 2GPI, indicating that the mAb bound to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and beta 2GPI in free solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, mAbs derived from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> have specificity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the fifth domain of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the idea that beta 2GPI acts as a primary Ag for these Abs </plain></SENT>
