<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary goal of this study was to evaluate with high-field MRI the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in a series of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The secondary goal was to detect a possible relationship between MRI and clinical or biological parameters in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We correlated the clinical and biological parameters of 58 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> defined according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, including 30 with neuropsychiatric manifestations with conventional and modern MRI (including diffusion weighted-images, high-resolution 3D T1 weighted-images) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population studied was compared to a group of 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 69% of cases, MRI demonstrated involvement of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> both in asymptomatic patients (64.3%) and in patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations (73.3%): microembolic signals, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> (associated with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, basal ganglia involvement, posterior leucoencephalopathy, subcortical calcification or hemosiderin deposits (T2*), dilated perivascular spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI with adapted sequences clearly demonstrated the cerebral involvement in approximately 70% of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms </plain></SENT>
