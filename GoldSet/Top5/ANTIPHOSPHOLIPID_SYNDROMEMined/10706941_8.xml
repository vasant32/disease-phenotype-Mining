<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular backgrounds of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and immunisation against the Rhesus proteolipid antigens are still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, expression of (1) CD1, a major histocompatibility complex class l-like <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> antigen presenting molecule, (2) IL-10, a cytokine promoting induction of clonal anergy, and (3) CD80 and CD86, two T-cell costimulators preventing induction of clonal anergy when present, was investigated in frozen sections of cervix, corpus and the fallopian tube (FT) of 25-day-old BALB/c mice injected with FSH, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> or medium and of pregnant mice from each trimester (days 7, 14 and 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD1 was expressed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endometrial epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhanced immunostaining of the endometrial epithelial cells was observed after FSH treatment, and cervix and FT expressed generally more than the corpus of the uterus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treatment with medroxy <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (MPA), expression of CD1 by the endometrial epithelia was weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy CD1 was absent from the endometrium adjacent to the foetus, but was unaltered in the cervix and FT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-10 was expressed by the endometrial glands and also by the endometrial surface epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MPA treatment increased the intensity of the IL-10 immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were also chains of positive cells between the muscle bundles within the pregnant myometrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD80 and CD86 were usually absent from the female reproductive tract, but were occasionally found in the cervix during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates definite differences in the expression of both CD1 and IL-10 between the FSH and MPA treated mice, suggesting differences during the oestrous cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As IL-10 is expressed more in the secretory phase, it is probably involved in making the endometrium more acceptable for implantation by inducing clonal anergy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the absence of CD80 and CD86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest that abnormal expression of CD1d during pregnancy may predispose the mother for immunisation against <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> antigens such as membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and Rhesus-antigens </plain></SENT>
