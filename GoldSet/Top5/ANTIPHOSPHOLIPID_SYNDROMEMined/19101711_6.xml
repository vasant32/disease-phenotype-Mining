<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is scarce information on the management habits with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing in patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: RIETE is an ongoing registry of consecutive patients with symptomatic VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aimed to estimate the extent to which <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> test ordering patterns are consistent with the recommendations by a 2005 international consensus statement, we retrospectively compared the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and those who were not tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 21367 patients enrolled, 4494 (21%) were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>: 1456 (32%) tested positive, 3038 (68%) negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common abnormalities were: Factor V Leiden (N=376), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (N=289), and prothrombin G20210A (N=263) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12740 (60%) patients met one or more criteria of the consensus statement: 7894 (37%) had a first episode of idiopathic VTE; 4013 (19%) were aged &lt;50 years; 133 (0.6%) were pregnant women; 758 (3.5%) were using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi>; 3375 (16%) had recurrent VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of them, 3618 (28%) underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> tests, 34% of whom tested positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients testing positive was significantly higher in those aged &lt;50 years, with no differences between idiopathic or secondary, first episode or recurrent VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, 876 (10%) of the 8627 (40%) patients meeting no criteria were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 208 (24%) tested positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-eight percent of patients meeting one or more criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing, and 10% of those with no criteria were actually tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a substantial proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> ordering is not consistent with the recommendations made by the consensus statement </plain></SENT>
