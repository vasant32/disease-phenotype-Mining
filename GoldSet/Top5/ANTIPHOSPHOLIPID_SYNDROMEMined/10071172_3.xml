<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) have been recognized as a marker for an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no documented reports from India on the prevalence of aCL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed at establishing the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with CVT and evaluating their clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with CVT diagnosed by angiography and/or cranial CT were investigated for the presence of aCL along with 31 age- and sex-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had no overt evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic lupus erythematosis</z:e> or related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The titres of IgG and IgM type of aCL were estimated in the sera using a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 22.6% of CVT patients compared to 3.2% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 75.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five CVT patients had both IgG and IgM antibodies, and 2 had only IgG antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aCL positive group did not differ from the aCL-negative group with respect to the clinical characteristics and the demographic and risk factor profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that anticardiolipin antibodies are a risk marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies on a larger group of patients are needed to establish the role of aCL in the pathogenesis of CVT </plain></SENT>
