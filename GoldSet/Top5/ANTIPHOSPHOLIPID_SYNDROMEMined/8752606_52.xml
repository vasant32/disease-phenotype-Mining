<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The British Columbia Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program, located in a tertiary care academic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic screening protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genetic, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, infectious, anatomical, and autoimmune factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A structural genetic factor was identified in 3.5% of the couples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> factor, including luteal phase deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, was identified in 20% and an infectious factor was identified in 0.5% of the couples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An anatomical factor, including various m√ºllerian tract anomalies and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241593,C1704274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intrauterine adhesions</z:e>, was found in 16% and an autoimmune factor, including the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and the undifferentiated connective tissue syndrome, was identified in 20% of the couples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four couples who completed the diagnostic screening protocol were classified as having unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 84 couples, 65% were subclassified as primary, 27% were subclassified as secondary, and 7% had unclassified unexplained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale study identified genetic, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, infectious, anatomical, or autoimmune factors in approximately 60% of couples with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
