<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We have observed several cases of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) or full blown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) after being successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CYC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the significance of this phenomenon we undertook a retrospective study of our patient population with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts of 320 patients with SLE, either CYC treated (n = 117) or non-treated (n = 203), were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disease activity over time was evaluated using the European Consensus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scoring system, as well as initial and cumulative anti-dsDNA antibody titers and C3, C4 complement levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aPL titers (IgG and IgM) were documented for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seroconversion was defined as the de novo appearance of aPL antibodies at a titer higher than the 99th percentile of 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera, tested on 2 occasions 12 weeks apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seroconversion occurred in 22 out of 117 patients treated with CYC as compared with 2 out of 203 non-CYC treated patients [odds ratio (OR) = 23.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.36-101.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients from the seroconverted CYC treated group were diagnosed with APS compared to none in the non-CYC treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between seroconversion and CYC remained significant after adjustment for ECLAM score after treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose and disease duration (OR = 13.4, 95% CI 2.67-67.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seroconversion occurred despite successful disease remission as judged by significant decrease of: anti-dsDNA antibody titers (p &lt; 0.01), ECLAM scores (p &lt; 0.01), and C3 (p &lt; 0.01) and C4 levels (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that CYC therapy might be associated with upregulation of aPL and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> despite suppression of SLE activity </plain></SENT>
