<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two complement effector pathways are initiated by the cleavage of C5, C5a and C5b, which leads to the formation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To delineate and distinguish the role of C5a from the C5b-9 membrane attack complex seeded by C5b, we examined the in vivo effects (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) of aPL on C5a receptor-deficient (C5aR-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C5aR-/- and C5aR+/+ mice were injected with IgM or with IgG from two different patients with APS (IgM-APS or IgG-APS) or with control IgM or IgG (IgM-NHS or IgG-NHS) twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complement fixing activity of the Ig fractions and anticardiolipin activity in the sera of the mice were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgM-APS but not IgG-APS fixed C1q to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>-coated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgM-APS significantly enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size in C5aR+/+ mice compared to C5aR+/+ mice treated with IgM-NHS (3198 +/- 2361 microm2 versus 585 +/- 460 microm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C5aR-/- mice treated with IgM-APS showed a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> size as compared with C5aR+/+ mice (676 +/- 690 microm2 versus 3198 +/- 2361 microm2; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that C5aR-/- mice are protected from the thrombogenic effects of some aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
