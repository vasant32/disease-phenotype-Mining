<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, with higher prevalence in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An incidence peak occurs during the reproductive years, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> may play a role in the clinical presentation of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLS), but can be found in patients with SLE without APLS, and relate to cardiovascular risk and nephrite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at assessing whether the presence of ACA is associated with hormonal changes in a sample of women with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven women diagnosed with SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, aged 30.8 Â± 8.12 years, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None was on hormonal contraception, and their SLE activity was estimated using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified, according to the presence or absence of ACA, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and prolactin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine (19.1%) of 47 patients were positive for ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between groups concerning age, duration of disease, and SLEDAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the median <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> level was lower in the ACA-positive group [46.8 (21.0-72.1) pg/mL] than in the ACA-negative group [122.3 (64.8-172.7) pg/mL, P = 0.004] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest, for the first time, an inverse association between ACA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels in premenopausal SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Considering that both lower endogenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> levels and ACA positivity are related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, our finding may be clinically relevant in predicting cardiovascular risk and/or APLS development in SLE </plain></SENT>
