<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to examine the correlation between the presence of aPL and certain markers of renal function in systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (pts) with SSc were examined for the presence of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and to anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I (a-B2GPI) in immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, cystatin C, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studied pts together, three multiple-regression analyses were performed with one set cystatin C as a dependent variable, in the second GFR according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula and in the third <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance by Modification of Diet in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Renal Disease</z:e> (MDRD) formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As independent variables, aPL of either type were inserted in addition to disease duration and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL was significantly positively associated with serum cystatin C (p = 0.002), significantly negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD formula (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG a-B2GPI was significantly negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault (p = 0.03) and MDRD (p = 0.01) formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgM aCL and IgM a-B2GPI were not associated with any markers of the renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests the relationship between kidney involvement and the positivity for some aPL in patients with SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positivity for IgG aCL and IgG a-B2GPI in patients with SSc without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> seems to be connected with decrease of glomerular filtration </plain></SENT>
