<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> often involve the trigeminosensory nerve to provoke craniofacial pain, we hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> aberration may play a role with regard to NH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the antibodies to antinuclear factor, ds-DNA, extracted nuclear antigens, rheumatoid factor, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, in 23 primary NH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among them were 16 patients (69.6%) found as having at least one abnormal autoimmune index, namely, antibodies to antinuclear factor in 8 patients, SSA/La in 6 patients, rheumatoid factor in 4 patients, SSB/Ro in 2 patients, and ds-DNA in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abnormal increase of blood anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibody was noted in 4 patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in 1 patient, whereas HLA-B27 seropositivity was detected in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for 2 patients positive for antinuclear factor without other associated features, 15 patients (65%) were finally diagnosed as having Sjogren/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086981" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sicca syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of abnormal autoimmune indices and disorders is present in primary NH patients, suggesting a probable relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> aberration and epicranial neuralgia in NH </plain></SENT>
