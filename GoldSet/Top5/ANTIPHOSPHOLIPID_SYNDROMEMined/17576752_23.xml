<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Administration of intravenous Ig (IVIG) is a recognized, safe and efficient mode of immunomodulatory therapy for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-idiotypic antibody binding to pathogenic autoantibodies and hence inhibition of binding to the corresponding antigen is one postulated mechanism of the beneficial effect of IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to fractionate the anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta(2)GPI) anti-idiotypic antibodies from a commercial IVIG preparation and use it as a treatment in an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anti-beta(2)GPI polyclonal antibodies were purified on a beta(2)GPI column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified antibodies were bound to CN-Br-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> and employed for purification of IVIG-anti-anti-beta(2)GPI (anti-idiotypic antibodies), defined as specific intravenous Ig (sIVIG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The idiotype specificities were confirmed by competition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of sIVIG in vitro was tested in a trophoblast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> matrigel/invasion assay (i.e. proliferation and metalloproteinase (MMP)2/MMP9 expression) and in vivo in a fetal loss model of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies inhibited human trophoblast cell invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The function was attributed to the Fab portion of the anti-beta(2)GPI Igs, since beta(2)GPI-related synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> specific for the Fab part of the anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies neutralized its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>APS sIVIG fraction reduce human trophoblast invasion in vitro by 560 times more than the whole IVIG compound and improved the MMP2 and MMP9 production by trophoblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>sIVIG improved significantly (200 times more) the pregnancy outcome in BALB/c mice passively infused with anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies, in comparison to treatment with IVIG (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current results, we propose that APS sIVIG may be considered as potential specific therapeutic safe compound for developing a treatment for APS patient's early fetal loss </plain></SENT>
