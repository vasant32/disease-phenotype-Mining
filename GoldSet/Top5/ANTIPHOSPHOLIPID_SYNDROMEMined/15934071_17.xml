<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe dermatologic manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to investigate possible correlations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and other APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a single-center study of 200 consecutive patients with primary or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-related APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To qualify for the study, patients had to fulfill clinical and laboratory criteria from the most recent international consensus statement on classification of definite APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dermatologic manifestations were systematically evaluated by a dermatologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only dermatologic lesions that may be related to APS were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and other APS manifestations were determined using Fisher's 2-tailed, chi-square, and nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dermatologic manifestations were noted in 49% of the patients and were the presenting manifestations in 30.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Livedo reticularis</z:hpo> was the most frequent manifestation, observed in 25.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Livedo reticularis</z:hpo> was shown to be significantly associated with cerebral or ocular ischemic arterial events (odds ratio [OR] 10.8, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 5.2-22.5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.6-16), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arterial events (OR 6, 95% CI 2.9-12.6), heart valve abnormalities detected on echocardiography (OR 7.3, 95% CI 3.6-14.7), and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> (&gt;/=160/90 mm Hg) (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, it was observed with decreased frequency in patients with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The dermatologic manifestations of APS are frequently the presenting feature of the syndrome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> is significantly associated with the arterial subset of APS </plain></SENT>
