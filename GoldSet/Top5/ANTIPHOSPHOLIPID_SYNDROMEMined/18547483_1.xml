<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is associated with many pathologies with several clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can occur as a primary disorder or may be secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in two categories of patients: in one group with many clinical manifestations (such as thrombotic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>) and in the other group with few clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first group high levels of IgG and IgA antibodies resulted, in the other group low levels of IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio male:female was 1:3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of the 700 patients examined, 12 resulted positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and a-beta2-GPI (affected by APS), and 15 patients positive for aCL (with middle-high values) but negative for a-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this point, according to the guidelines, we could have stopped examining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only by continuing diagnostic investigation for these 15 patients has it been possible to observe: 2 patients positive for anti-thrombin (important first marker in the diagnosis of venose and arterial thromboses), anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-phosphatidylinositol (markers for cerebral diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>); 1 patient positive for anti- phosphatidylserine; 1 patient positive for anti-phosphatidylinositol antibody; 1 patient positive for both anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-phosphatidylinositol; 10 patients positive only for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the results obtained, and considering that a more accurate investigation permitted to better identify APS syndrome, we propose a new diagnostic procedure </plain></SENT>
