<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of this cohort was approximately a decade younger than the average atherothromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victim and women were more commonly involved than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors was lowest in the group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with the highest levels of IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other serological abnormalities associated with aPL (false-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="std|stds">Venereal Disease</z:e> Research Laboratory test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> [aPTT]) were more common in the group with over 100 GPL units (high positive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with the highest IgG anticardiolipin titers had the shortest times to subsequent thrombo-occlusive events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common recurrent event was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, often occurring within the first year of follow-up during a mean prospective follow-up of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over one-half of the cohort had at least one recurrent thrombo-occlusive event during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This distinct syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> should be recognized for its younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, predominance of women, high risk of recurrent thrombo-occlusive events, and the possible use of the IgG anticardiolipin antibody titer for prognosis </plain></SENT>
