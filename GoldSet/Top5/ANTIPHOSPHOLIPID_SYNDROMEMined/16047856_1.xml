<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the effects of two therapeutic protocols for the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> associated with the presence of antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective observational study included 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the first group who received low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second group of 20 patients, in addition to this therapy, received immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aspirin was administered at the time of a positive pregnancy test, and low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> not before the fetal heart activity registration by ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin was given prior to the conception or at the beginning of the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared these groups according to the pregnancy outcomes and the occurrence of complications during pregnancy, using standard statistical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of positive gestational outcome in the patients treated with aspirin and low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was 85% (17/20), and in the second group it was 90% (18/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes between these groups (p &gt; 0.05), except for the occurence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, which were recorded only in the aspirin and low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group, but with no statistical significance (p &gt; 0.05) compared to the second group, which received immunoglobulin additionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in pregnancy outcomes between the two studied therapeutic protocols, but the therapy with aspirin and low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was cheaper and easier to apply than the therapy with immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of our study confirmed that the final pathogenic mechanisms in recurrent fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the uteroplacental blood vessels </plain></SENT>
