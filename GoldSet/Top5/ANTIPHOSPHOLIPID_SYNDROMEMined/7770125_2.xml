<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) were found in 7 of 11 relatives studied out of three different generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, antigenic Factor (F) XII deficiencies or borderline values were found in the propositus and 2 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence for F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>XII inhibitors was found in the propositus, one of his brothers and both of his parents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>XII inhibitors in patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and/or LA are pathophysiologically relevant in vivo or if they are only an in vitro phenomenon remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is reasonable to believe that the main laboratory pathology (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and/or LA activity) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is related to the clinical picture of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is evidence from the literature that deficiency or inhibition of F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>XII might contribute to a prothrombotic state through impairment of the fibrinolytic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> are able to reduce protein C activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From a clinical point of view, it seems that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> in our patient was controlled by low-dose aspirin therapy (75 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this case seems to support the idea of a genetic predisposition for the development of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and/or LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The related disturbances of the coagulatory, anticoagulatory and fibrinolytic systems might contribute in different ways to the prothrombotic state seen in patients with "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>", eventually resulting in possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> with corresponding ischaemic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
