<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IgG, IgA and IgM anti-beta2-GPI antibodies in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), and to establish the clinical significance of IgA type antibodies compared with the other isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were measured in the sera of 70 patients by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay in gamma-irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates coated with human purified beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three out of the 70 patients were classified as having APS: three of them had primary, and 30 had secondary APS related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 37 patients had SLE without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies of IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes were present in 84.8%, 59.3% and 51.5% of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the frequency and the level of each isotype were significantly higher in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This association was very strong for IgA (P = 0.0004 for the antibody frequency and P &lt; 0.0001 for the antibody level), as well as for IgG type antibodies (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001), whereas it was weaker for IgM (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong relationship was demonstrated between increased IgA anti-beta2-GPI antibody levels and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-beta2-GPI antibodies were associated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) in addition to the main features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, antibodies of IgM isotype were related only to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend the evaluation of anti-beta2-GPI antibodies of IgA isotype in addition to IgG in patients with clinical suspicion of APS </plain></SENT>
