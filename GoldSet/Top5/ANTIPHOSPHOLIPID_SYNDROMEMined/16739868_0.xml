<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of aCL in predicting ischemic events, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine if aCL is either associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> or with an increased risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or thrombotic events, we performed a prospective study on a cohort of Romanian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that were tested for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in the two subgroups (aCL positive or aCL negative) considering the age of patients and the medical evolution in the first 12 months after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Globally, neither the antecedents of thrombotic events or abortions, nor the clinical or biological profile or the recurrence of vascular events showed any significant difference between the group with or without aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only in two patients the criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were fulfilled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 37% of cases, there was a variability of aCL positive titers at 8 weeks after the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This raised the necessity to isolate a subpopulation with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the presence of aCL, and the need of more specific subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
