<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (study group) and 11 healthy controls, matched by maternal and gestational age (control group) were prospectively examined for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in the cord blood during labour, and amniotic fluid during vaginal or Caesarean delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three neonates (27.3%) in the study group had anticardiolipin antibodies in the cord blood, while none had them in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in the amniotic fluid in six (54.5%) of the study group pregnancies, compared with none in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No adverse neonatal outcome was noted except for significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0006) mean birth weight in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies can pass the placenta and be detected in fetal cord blood and amniotic fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding might be used in the future for the assessment of pregnancies with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
