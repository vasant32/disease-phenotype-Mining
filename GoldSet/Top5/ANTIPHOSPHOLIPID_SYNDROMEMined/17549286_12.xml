<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of the 675 insertion/deletion (4G/5G) polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene on the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of published data regarding this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive electronic search was carried out up until September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 22 articles were included in the analysis that was performed using random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen papers, concerning patients without another known risk factor, comprised 2,644 cases and 3,739 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alleles contrast (4G vs. 5G allele) yielded a statistically significant odds ratio (OR) of 1.153 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.068-1.246) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a sub-analysis of five studies that included 256 cases with another genetic risk factor and 147 controls, the combined per-allele OR was still significant (OR: 1.833,95% CI: 1.325-2.536) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the analysis of five studies regarding cases with a non-genetic risk factor for VTE (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>) provided insignificant results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, the 4G allele appears to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, particularly in subjects with other genetic thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recommendation for detection of this polymorphism in evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in such patients might be considered </plain></SENT>
