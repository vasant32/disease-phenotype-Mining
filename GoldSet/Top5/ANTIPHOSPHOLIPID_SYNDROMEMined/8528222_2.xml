<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies to determine the mechanisms of action of these antibodies have been hindered by their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and limited availability of techniques to isolate and characterize subgroups of the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> affinity chromatography method which enables separation of antiphospholipid positive sera into more than one antibody subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from five patients with complications of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each serum was applied to chromatography columns prepared by coating <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> beads (diameter 100 A) with phosphatidylserine (PS) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear salt gradient (0.03-1.0 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) was used for elution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eluates were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding and for inhibition of the prothrombin-thrombin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009946" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">conversion reaction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each sample yielded two to three peaks for CL and PS affinity columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molarities at which peaks were eluted differed between samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For individual samples, molarities at which peaks were eluted differed between CL and PS columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that aPL antibodies are heterogenous, with differences existing between patients and even within single serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subpopulations differed in their avidities for CL and PS but generally <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had prothrombinase inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
