<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, a frequently occurring clinical manifestation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, is a process in which platelets play a crucial role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that binding of dimeric beta(2)-GPI to the platelet receptors <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E receptor 2' (ApoER2') and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ibalpha (GPIbalpha) mediates increased platelet activation in an in vitro <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The individual roles of ApoER2' and GPIbalpha in mediating platelet activation by dimeric beta(2)-GPI has hitherto been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have determined the roles of either receptor in platelet activation by dimeric beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: Platelet activation by dimeric beta(2)-GPI was studied under conditions of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracellular signaling induced by dimeric beta(2)-GPI was subsequently analyzed by means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increase in platelet deposition onto a fibronectin surface under conditions of flow by dimeric beta(2)-GPI was completely abolished by inhibition of the interaction of dimeric beta(2)-GPI with either GPIbalpha or ApoER2' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon platelet stimulation with dimeric beta(2)-GPI, GPIbalpha translocated to the cytoskeleton via the scaffold protein 14-3-3zeta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, ApoER2' dissociated from the adapter protein Disabled1, presumably through phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of one process could not inhibit the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We show that dimeric beta(2)-GPI signals via two distinct pathways in platelets, both of which are required for platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abrogation of either signal results in loss of activation </plain></SENT>
