<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The factors causing production of anti-beta2GPI remain unidentified, but an association with infectious agents has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, we identified a hexapeptide (TLRVYK) that is recognized specifically by a pathogenic anti-beta2GPI mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study we evaluated the APS-related pathogenic potential of microbial pathogens carrying sequences related to this hexapeptide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice immunized with a panel of microbial preparations were studied for the development of anti-beta2GPI autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG specific to the TLRVYK <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were affinity purified from the immunized mice and passively infused intravenously into naive mice at day 0 of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APS parameters were evaluated in the infused mice on day 15 of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following immunization, high titers of antipeptide [TLRVYK] anti-beta2GPI Ab's were observed in mice immunized with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity of binding to the corresponding target molecules was confirmed by competition and immunoblot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Naive mice infused with the affinity-purified antipeptide Ab's had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> and elevated percentage of fetal loss, similar to a control group of mice immunized with a pathogenic anti-beta2GPI mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study establishes a mechanism of molecular mimicry in experimental APS, demonstrating that <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> homologous with beta2GPI induce pathogenic anti-beta2GPI Ab's along with APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
