<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (PAPS) is an autoimmune condition defined by anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) and thrombotic or obstetric events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some PAPS can evolve into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies systematically examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> autoantibodies and their clinical significance in PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to analyze the clinical and laboratory correlations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-related autoantibodies, detected by immunoprecipitation (IP), a technique not yet systematically applied to investigate autoantibodies in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 52 PAPS patients were screened by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA), IP of ³⁵S-labeled K562 cell extract, and ELISA [anti-Argonaute2 (Ago2, Su), 60kRo, 52kRo, La, dsDNA)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-Ago2/Su positive sera were also tested for anti-GW bodies (GWBs) by IIF double staining, using rabbit anti-Rck/p54 serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: First, 56% of PAPS patients (29/52) were ANA positive, mainly with speckled pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-Ago2/Su antibodies were found in 13% (7/52), anti-Ro/SSA in 10% (5/52), anti-La in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical profile of patients did not seem to be related to the presence of these antibody specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, levels of IgG anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies were lower in anti-Ago2/Su positive patients (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of anti-Ago2/Su or -Ro patients developed SLE during a 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ago2 is a key component of GWBs, however, only 1/7 anti-Ago2/Su serum showed a typical cytoplasmic GWBs staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Ago2/Su and -Ro antibodies are the two autoantibodies detected by IP in our PAPS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clarifying why Ago2/Su and Ro are specific targets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> may help to understand the mechanisms of autoantibody production </plain></SENT>
