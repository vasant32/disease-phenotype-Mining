<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> II (HIT II) need an alternative nonheparin-based method of anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bivalirudin was used during CPB and deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> (DHCA) for resection of multiple right atrial masses in a patient with HIT II and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was monitored with the activated clotting time (ACT) and a target ACT of 450 seconds or greater was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical removal of multiple right atrial masses was successful and there was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clot was noticed in the cardiotomy and venous reservoir after CPB was discontinued and the system flushed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation was successfully managed with bivalirudin, a new short-acting, and direct thrombin inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to evaluate the safety of bivalirudin during DHCA </plain></SENT>
