<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated data from a quality assurance program to assess ACA assay usefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cross-laboratory (n = 56) testing of 12 serum samples yielded interlaboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) for lgG ACA and IgM ACA that were higher than 50% in 17 (71%) of 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The situation for testing consensus was of equal concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total consensus occurred in 6 (25%) of 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General consensus (interlaboratory agreement, 90% or more) was obtained in 10 (42%) of 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the majority of test cases, laboratories could not agree on whether a serum sample tested was ACA-positive or ACA-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differing method-related issues also were evident; some methods tended toward higher or lower ACA values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Method-based majority consensus differed from participant majority consensus on many test occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exceedingly high interlaboratory result variation, combined with a general lack of test result grading consensus and method-based variation, indicate that a cautious clinical approach toward laboratory findings is prudent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests should be repeated at least once before making a clinical diagnosis of any anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome-like disorder </plain></SENT>
