<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a histopathologically ascertained diagnosis of JLI performed at the Laboratoire d'Histopathologie Cutan√©e of the Strasbourg University Hospital between 1993 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information about patient characteristics and follow-up data were retrieved between 2004 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to features indicative of LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 210 consecutive patients (102 women and 108 men) with a mean age 42 years were diagnosed with JLI in the reference period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>175 patients (83%) had multiple lesions and 32 patients (15%) had only a single lesion at the time of diagnosis (data not available in 3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The head, neck and upper part of the thorax were involved in 171 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An annular or arciform configuration and/or arrangement were present in 111 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesions consisted of red (100%) papules or plaques (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (7.6%) had proven LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients (1%) developed &gt;4 ACR criteria of systemic LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and 2 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This high frequency of patients with typical features of LE strongly argues that JLI could be a dermal variant of LE and not an autonomous entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It might be the cutaneous marker of a subset of LE patients with excellent prognosis </plain></SENT>
