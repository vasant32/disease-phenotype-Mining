<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ethiology has not yet been fully clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of the study was to compare the "mini-mental state examination" (MMSE) outcomes in SLE patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Probands producing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> presented with significantly worse results in MMSE when compared to patients without these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antisphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and those with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that association of SLE with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> (not only with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) aggravates the deterioration of cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMSE test should not be omitted in the follow-up of SLE patients </plain></SENT>
