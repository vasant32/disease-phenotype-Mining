<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the diseases is unclear and the etiology is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the last 8 years our laboratory has been involved in induction of experimental SLE and APLS both by passive transfer of pathogenic antibodies (e.g., anticardiolipin) and by active immunization with pathogenic idiotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The naive mice, following immunization with Ab1, develop anti-autoantibody (Ab2) and eventually anti-autoantibody (Ab3) which has the binding capacities of anti-DNA or anticardiolipin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice with the characteristic syndromes were employed to analyze pathogenic mechanisms and new therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
