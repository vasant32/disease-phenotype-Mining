<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 122 patients with SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies were detected in 44% of 59 patients according to the diagnostic criteria by Harris and Hughes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This frequency was significantly (p &lt; 0.005) higher than the 14% seen in patients without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies were strongly (p &lt; 0.005) associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies were positive in 64% of IgG beta2-GPI dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody negative APS patients under the Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above findings indicate that IgG anti-PS-PT antibodies as well as beta2,-GPI dependent anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies should be examined in the diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
