<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients of APS (24 primary and 6 secondary) were recruited in the study who fulfilled the revised Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control groups comprised of age- and sex-matched 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients each of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> without any antecedent thrombotic event and/or APS-related pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were tested for PAI-1 antigen levels measured by quantitative ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity rate of PAI-1 in patients of primary, secondary as well as total APS patients was significantly higher in relation to age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (p = 0.010, p = 0.003 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
