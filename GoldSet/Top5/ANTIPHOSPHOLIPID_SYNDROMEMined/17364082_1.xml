<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PICTURE: A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> was delayed in a patient presenting with limb and facial swelling until she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> upper airway compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After excluding allergic and hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo>, acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> (AAE) was suspected, possibly precipitated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associated clinical and laboratory features led to a diagnosis of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT: Management proved challenging and included high dose steroids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: The patient responded to treatment and remains in remission without recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AAE occurs due to the acquired deficiency of inhibitor of C1 component of complement (C1 INH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>Lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> and anti-C1 INH antibodies are well-described associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, one should also consider the possibility of SLE </plain></SENT>
