<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight (LMW) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was given since the 12th gestational week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy and cesarean delivery were uncomplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five weeks postpartum, the patient developed a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019087" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic diathesis</z:e> with marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> accompanied by vaginal, nasal and <z:mp ids='MP_0011514'>cutaneous bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variety of autoimmune phenomena were also detected, partly at clinical presentation and partly later on, despite ongoing steroid treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values within a few weeks secondary to high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An ultrasound of both legs, performed because of persistent complaint of moderate calf pain, revealed bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biochemical findings were not consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) or the '<z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> and low platelet syndrome' (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HELLP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were not fulfilled either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complex of thrombohemorrhagic complications and autoimmune phenomena seen in this case is unusual and not previously described in the late puerperal stage of APS-related pregnancies </plain></SENT>
