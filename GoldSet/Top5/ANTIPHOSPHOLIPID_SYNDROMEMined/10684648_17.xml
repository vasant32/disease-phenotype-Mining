<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> found in the plasma of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> generally do not interact with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membranes directly, but recognize (plasma) proteins associated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membranes, mostly prothrombin or beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, it has been proposed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> may cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by displacing annexin V from procoagulant cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used ellipsometry to study the binding of annexin V and of complexes of beta(2)GPI with patient-derived IgG antibodies to beta(2)GPI, commonly referred to as anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayers composed of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> (PC) and 20% phosphatidylserine (PS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More specifically, we investigated the competition of these proteins for the binding sites at these bilayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes, adsorbed to PSPC bilayers, are displaced for more than 70% by annexin V and that annexin V binding is unaffected by the presence of ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, annexin V preadsorbed to these bilayers completely prevents adsorption of ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes, and none of the preadsorbed annexin V is displaced by ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using ellipsometry, we also studied the effect of ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes on the interaction of annexin V with the membranes of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi>-activated blood platelets as a more physiological relevant model of cell membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The experiments with blood platelets confirm the high-affinity binding of annexin V to these membranes and unequivocally show that annexin V binding is unaffected by the presence of ACA-beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data unambiguously show that ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes are unable to displace annexin V from procoagulant membranes to any significant extent, whereas annexin V does displace the majority of preadsorbed ACA-beta(2)GPI complexes from these membranes </plain></SENT>
