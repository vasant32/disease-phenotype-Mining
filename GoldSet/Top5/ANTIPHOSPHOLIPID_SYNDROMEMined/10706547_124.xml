<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>According to a recent hypothesis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> results from the concurrence of several factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was assessed in patients with portal or hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> by simultaneously investigating most of the currently identified prothrombotic disorders, local precipitating factors, and other risk factors such as oral contraceptive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with a tumorous obstruction and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prothrombotic disorders that were investigated included classical and occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>; protein C; protein S and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>; factor V Leiden; factor II; and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi>-reductase gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 1 or several prothrombotic disorders and a local precipitating factor in 26 and 10 of the 36 patients with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, respectively; and in 28 and none of the 32 patients with hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a combination of prothrombotic disorders in 5 and 9 patients with portal and hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, respectively, whereas such a combination is expected in less than 1% of asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients with a local precipitating factor, 8 had a prothrombotic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients who use oral contraceptives, 10 had a prothrombotic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that portal or hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> should be regarded as an index for 1 or several prothrombotic disorders, whether or not local precipitating factors or oral contraceptive use are found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concurrence of prothrombotic disorders is more common than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extensive investigation of prothrombotic disorders and anticoagulation should be considered in patients with portal or hepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
