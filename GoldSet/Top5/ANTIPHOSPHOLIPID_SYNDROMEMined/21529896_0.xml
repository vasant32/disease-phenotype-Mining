<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic value of aCL and aβ2GPI measured by a new automated system using the chemiluminescence principle, the immunoanalyzer Zenit RA (Menarini) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results of aCL and aβ2GPI were correlated with the clinical background of the patients and with results of ELISA (n=314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlated to the clinical background sensitivity/specificity ranged for aCL IgG between 7.5-45.2% / 54.2-98.8%, for aCL IgM 3.4-5.5% / 89.9-94%, for aβ2GPI IgG 5.5-25.3% / 75.6-100% and aβ2GPI IgM 3.4-4.8% / 89.9-92.3%, depending on the cut-off used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity with manufacturer's cut-offs was comparable to ELISA, except for aβ2GPI IgG with a significantly lower sensitivity compared to ELISA (5.5% vs 11.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the APS patient population (n=30) sensitivity of aCL IgG and aβ2GPI IgG was higher measured by ELISA compared to Zenit RA (46.7% vs 30.0%, and 46.7% vs 26.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement between Zenit RA results and ELISA results for the four parameters was moderate (Kappa-values ranging 0.509-0.565) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity was 38.5%, 53.3%, 40% and 69.2% for aCL IgG, aCL IgM, aβ2GPI IgG and aβ2GPI IgM, respectively, applying the highest cut-off value for Zenit RA, raising towards 64.3%, 100%, 57.1%, for aCL IgG, aCL IgM, aβ2GPI IgG, respectively, in a APS patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new technology of chemiluminescense for measuring aPL showed good performance characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of results with a cut-off value associated with a good discrimination for disease, resulted in a lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of APS for aβ2GPI IgG measured by Zenit RA assays compared to ELISA; sensitivity for aCL IgG was comparable to ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specificity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters was high and comparable for aCL and aβ2GPI </plain></SENT>
