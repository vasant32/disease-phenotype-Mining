<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the intracellular mechanism involved in the up-regulation of tissue factor (TF) on endothelial cells (ECs) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), we examined the effects of aPL on the transcription, expression, and function of TF, the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, the induction of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS), and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK on human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cultured HUVECs were treated with IgG aPL (from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> [APS]) or with control IgG (from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">Phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) were used as positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TF expression was determined on the surface of HUVECs using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TF activity was determined with the use of a chromogenic assay in cell lysates, and TF <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and induction of iNOS were determined by Western blotting, and levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>, LPS, and aPL significantly increased the expression of TF compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This up-regulation was significantly inhibited by SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK) and by MG132 (a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TF activity was significantly increased by treatment with IgG aPL and this effect was also inhibited by SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incubation of HUVECs with aPL increased TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> 2-15-fold; these effects were abrogated by SB203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IgG aPL induced significant phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and produced iNOS on HUVECs in a time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IgG aPL also induced increased expression of IL-6 and IL-8 on HUVECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that aPL induces significant increases in TF transcription, function, and expression, in IL-6 and IL-8 up-regulation, and in iNOS expression on HUVECs and that these processes involve phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and activation of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Understanding intracellular events in aPL-mediated EC activation may help in designing new targeted therapies for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
