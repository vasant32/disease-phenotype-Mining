<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some evidence supports a relationship between anti-plasminogen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi>) antibodies, anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta(2)GP1) antibodies, and fibrinolysis, but their relationship is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of study is to evaluate the association between IgG anti-beta(2)GP1 and IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of consecutive patients with PAPS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE): 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), 32 patients without LAC, and 40 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG against beta(2)GP1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a value above the 99th percentile of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy control was considered as positive, and their interrelationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was evaluated by Pearson Chi-squared test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactive antibodies binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> and beta(2)GP1 were determined in a competitive and cross-inhibition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of fibrinolytic activity in the presence of IgG fractions from patients and healthy controls were examined using a plasmin fluorogenic substrate assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high frequency of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies (35.9%) was found in 64 patients, and its presence was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p = 0.001), which may be due to its ability to inhibit exogenous fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coexistence of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> and IgG anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies was found in 11 of 64 patients and was related with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactive antibody binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> and beta(2)GP1 was found in IgG fractions from three patients and a monoclonal anti-beta(2)GP1 antibody BD4, and one of these three patients had thrombotic history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no significant association was found between IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> and IgG anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevalence of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> was high in patients with PAPS and SLE and might relate with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity of IgG anti-beta(2)GP1 antibodies with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> may occur in the sera of patients </plain></SENT>
