<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To analyze the prevalence of aCL and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS) in relation to pregnancy failures in women with the history of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A sequential study of 155 patients, who had three or more recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo>, was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss in first trimester were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies IgG and aPS IgG were detected in the serum by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Percentage calculation was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-tailed t-test was performed to know the significance of aCL and aPS total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The levels of aCL IgG and aPS IgG were detected as 40% (62) and 19% (18), respectively in women with history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anticardiolipin antibody is found to be the most important factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, women with negative aCL are having positive for another <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> like aPS, which may involve in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
