<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe 3 patients with PAPS and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3, and features consistent with membranous and focal segmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> were disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These histological lesions were not yet reported in PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the spectrum of renal lesions in PAPS is diverse and that it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
