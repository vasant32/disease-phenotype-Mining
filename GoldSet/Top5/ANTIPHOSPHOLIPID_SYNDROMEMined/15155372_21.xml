<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of carotid arteries and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> was measured in 20 patients with PAPS (mean (SD) age 35 (12) years) and in 20 controls matched for age and sex (34 (12) years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> was similar in the two groups, but plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was higher in patients with PAPS (mean (SD) 11.9 (6.2) v 8.2 (3.4) micromol/l, p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was slightly greater in patients with PAPS than in controls at the carotid bifurcation (mean (SD) 0.61 (0.24) v 0.48 (0.09) mm, p = 0.04) and internal carotid artery (0.52 (0.22) v 0.40 (0.08), p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These differences were more evident in patients aged &gt;40 years than in those aged &lt;30 years at the carotid bifurcation (0.76 (0.25) v 0.55 (0.06), p = 0.0007) and internal carotid artery (0.63 (0.25) v 0.45 (0.09), p = 0.02); no differences were seen in the younger age group compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a possibility in patients with PAPS in their fourth decade of life or older </plain></SENT>
