<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A number of generic (not strictly SLE related) and specific (disease related) risk factors to which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients have been exposed in the span of 5 years before the first neuropsychiatric (NP) event or before the last available observation were checked for and their distribution was analysed in 959 SLE patients with and without NP involvement; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the first NP events that occurred in a time frame of 10 years were recorded and categorized as SLE related or SLE unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-six SLE patients with and 633 SLE patients without NP manifestations were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 469 NP events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> (26.1%), cerebrovascular events (22.7%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorders</z:e> (8.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (14.4%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> (9.5%) were the most frequent SLE-related NP events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More risk factors [mean 4.52 (2.44) vs 3.73 (2.01); P &lt; 0.0001] were observed in patients with than without NP involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, aPLs, LA and APS were factors more strongly associated with NP involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In SLE, NP involvement and aPLs were confirmed as closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, other modifiable generic risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, carotid vasculopathy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, appeared to be related to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e>, suggesting the need for a more intensive preventive strategy to optimize the management of NP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
