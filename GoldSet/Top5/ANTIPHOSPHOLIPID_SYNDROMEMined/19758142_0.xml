<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been shown to activate the coagulation pathway via several mechanisms, activate platelets via thrombin formation, and suppress fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we propose another possible mechanism that involves certain chemokines and results in platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is based on the observations that anti-beta2GPI antibodies stimulated monocytes to secrete inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, which in turn stimulated vascular endothelial cells to express chemokines such as CX3CL1 and CCL5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CX3CL1 increased the ability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets to adhere to collagen at a high shear rate, while CCL5 induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of tissue factor, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha by monocytes stimulated with anti-beta2GPI antibodies, as well as CX3CL1 and CCL5 by vascular endothelial cells stimulated with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suppressed by the NF-kappaB-specific inhibitor DHMEQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the NF-kappaB pathway may be a potential therapeutic target relating to both the coagulation pathway and platelet activity </plain></SENT>
