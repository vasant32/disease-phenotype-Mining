<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, clinical associations, and outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and in SLE patients without aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kidney biopsy specimens obtained from 81 patients with aPL (18 of whom had APS) and 70 patients without aPL were retrospectively examined for the presence of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and serologic data obtained at the time of kidney biopsy and during a mean followup of 7 years were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases for which serial kidney biopsy specimens were available, the evolution of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> existed in 39.5% of patients with aPL, compared with only 4.3% of patients without aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among aPL-positive SLE patients, APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was found in two-thirds of those with APS and in one-third of those without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong association between APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo> levels at the time of kidney biopsy but did not have a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at the end of followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial kidney biopsy specimens were available from 11 patients and showed progression of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During followup, manifestations of APS (especially arterial thromboses) developed more frequently in the SLE/non-APS patients with APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> than in those without APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among patients with SLE, APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> occurs almost exclusively in those with aPL, suggesting an important role of aPL in the pathogenesis of APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, raised serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels, and progression of histologic lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are associated with a poor renal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of APS also tend to develop in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>APS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> should be included in the APS classification criteria, and the use of appropriate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy should be tested </plain></SENT>
