<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is associated with severe side effects, including the possible induction of autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter was proven for antithyroid microsomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was designed to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) in 30 patients receiving three different forms of immunotherapy for disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> using interleukin-2 (IL-2), alpha-interferon (alpha-interferon) or the combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were detected in none of 18 patients treated with IL-2 alone, 2 of 4 (50%) treated with alpha-interferon alone, and 3 of 8 (37.5%) treated with the combination of both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last group, increased concentrations of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were observed, while the patients were still receiving alpha-interferon alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> levels were not detected in any of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> who were not treated with alpha-interferon or IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with increased <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, five of five (100%) had a prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time and 4 or five (80%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, which in one patient was followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of therapy-induced elevated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> concentrations suggests that these should be carefully monitored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving immunotherapy with alpha-interferon </plain></SENT>
