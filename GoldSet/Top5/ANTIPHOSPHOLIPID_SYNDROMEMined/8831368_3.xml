<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sera of 89 consecutive patients and 80 matched control subjects were tested for antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M) and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aPL antibodies was significantly higher in patients (19 [21%] of 89) than in control subjects (7 [9%] of 80) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two subgroups according to the presence (subgroup A) or the absence (subgroup B) of aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in age or sex ratio was observed between the two subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was more frequent in subgroup A (8 [42%] of 19) than in subgroup B (8 [11%] of 70) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference with respect to the occurrence of thrombotic events was observed during a median follow-up period of 8.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus a high prevalence of aPL antibodies was found in patients referred for heart valve replacement compared with matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No increased risk has been demonstrated in the patients with aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
