<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The quality of anticoagulation therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The high risk of unnecessary anticoagulation and recent changes in the recommended International Normalized Ratio (INR) target range prompted a performance-improvement initiative to improve the care of patients with APS within the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics internal medicine and family medicine anticoagulation clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with an initial diagnosis of APS were evaluated through chart review to determine the anticoagulation indication, occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and INR target range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of APS diagnosis was made using Sapporo criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were made to the patients' physicians for confirmatory APS testing and changes in the anticoagulation regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INR target ranges were 2.0-3.0, 2.5-3.5, and 2.5-3.0 for 57%, 39%, and 4% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 6 (26%) of the 23 patients met Sapporo criteria for a definite diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 patients (74%) who did not meet these criteria, 8 (47%) had another indication for indefinite anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat APS testing was indicated for 7 patients, 5 of whom met Sapporo criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A lower target INR range of 2.0-3.0 was determined appropriate for 6 (26%) of the 23 patients evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A majority of patients with an initial diagnosis of APS did not meet criteria for a definite diagnosis of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those patients, approximately half had another indication for long-term anticoagulation, and one third were receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> dosages based on an INR target range that was higher than clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
