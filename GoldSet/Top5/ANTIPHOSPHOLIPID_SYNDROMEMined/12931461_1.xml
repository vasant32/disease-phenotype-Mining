<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 10 pregnant women with 3-5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any genetic, anatomical or infectious abnormalities were excluded as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and negative lymphocytotoxic test </plain></SENT>
