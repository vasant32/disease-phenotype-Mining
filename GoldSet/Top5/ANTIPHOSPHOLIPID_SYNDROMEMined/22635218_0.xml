<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypovitaminosis</z:e> D has been described in many systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> characterized by immune-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy loss, is a peculiar model for studying vitD, since these patients do not usually have a full-blown <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, nor do they have particular restrictions regarding sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed 25-OH vitD levels in 115 APS and 128 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors (NHD) with the LIAISONÂ® chemiluminescent immunoassay by DiaSorin (Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median values were lower in APS patients than in NHD, with the greatest difference occurring during summertime (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that APS patients may be somehow prevented from vitD generation upon sun exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, APS patients may have been instructed to use sunscreens in the presence of positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing patients with positive and negative ANA, we found comparable vitD levels during the summer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By subdividing APS patients according to clinical features, thrombotic APS patients showed significantly lower levels than did pure obstetric APS patients (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study confirms previous reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypovitaminosis</z:e> D in APS patients, making them more similar to patients with other systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> than NHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypovitaminosis</z:e> D may be part of the mosaic of factors that determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, rather than a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease and its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observation that patients with thrombotic APS, an aggressive phenotype, may be more deficient than those with exclusive obstetric manifestations fits well with the beneficial effects of vitD on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> described both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there may be a rationale to assess the efficacy of vitD supplementation in APS patients </plain></SENT>
