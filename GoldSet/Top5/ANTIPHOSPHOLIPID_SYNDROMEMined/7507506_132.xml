<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oxygen atoms were introduced on a <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> surface by irradiation with electron or gamma-ray radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the irradiated surfaces were oxidized to generate C-O and C = O moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aCL derived from either APS patients or (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice bound to beta 2-GPI coated on the irradiated plates, depending on the radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding to beta 2-GPI on the irradiated plates was competitively inhibited by simultaneous addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL)-coated latex beads mixed together with beta 2-GPI but were unaffected by addition of excess beta 2-GPI, CL micelles, or CL-coated latex beads alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a high correlation between binding values of aCL in sera from 40 APS patients obtained by the anti-beta 2-GPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the irradiated plates and those by the beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aCL have specificity for an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> is expressed by a conformational change occurring when beta 2-GPI interacts with an oxygen-substituted solid phase surface </plain></SENT>
