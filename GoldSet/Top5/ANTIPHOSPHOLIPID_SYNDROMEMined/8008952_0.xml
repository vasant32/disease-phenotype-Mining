<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with circulating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> (AL) (62 patients) and/or anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA) found in our center since 1981 and 1988, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TTPA, Kaolin's test (KT), and Russel's viper venom time (RVVT) and ACLA type IgG and IgM by ELISA: Only those patients meeting the criteria for PAPLS are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with PAPLS: Eleven patients were from the enlarged TTPA group, 11 of the total with positive ACLA, and two by KT and abnormal RVVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for gender, 18 were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the past three years, 19 patients were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria were from the very beginning: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in four, aborted repetitions in three, and plateletopenia in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients presented pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>Thrombopenia</z:mp> was manifested in the evolutionary course of 14 patients, only one of which being severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients have died (one of them from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>), and two others have had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> become negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients remain without treatment, the others undergoing anti-aggregating or anti-coagulant treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plateletopenia, alone or accompanied by other symptoms, is the most common alteration of PAPLS in our area, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> which caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Arterial thrombotic events and aborted repetitions are by no means infrequent </plain></SENT>
