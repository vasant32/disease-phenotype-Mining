<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a few previous studies have compared conventional and non-conventional MRI findings in MS and PAPLS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, MRI differences between anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody (APLA) positive (+) and APLA negative (-) MS patients have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the differences in MRI measures among patients with PAPLS, MS and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (NC) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also explored non-conventional MRI measures in APLA+ and APLA- MS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (49) consecutive MS patients among whom 39 had relapsing-remitting (RR) and 10 secondary-progressive (SP) disease course, 30 patients with PAPLS and 49 NC were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (28) MS patients were APLA+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI measures of T1- and T2-lesion volumes (LV) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, including fractions of whole brain (BPF), gray matter (GMF) and white matter (WMF), were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of T2- and T1-LVs and different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain tissue (NABT) compartments as well as diffusion-weighted imaging of whole brain mean parenchyma diffusivity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MS patients differed significantly from NC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MRI measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAPLS patients differed from NC in their T2-LV, in MTR measures and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When MS patients were compared to PAPLS patients, they showed significantly higher T2- and T1-LVs and T2-LV MTR, lower BPF and GMF and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>APLA+ RR and SPMS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> APLA+) patients showed significantly higher T2-LV, lower GMF, lower <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing gray matter MTR and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> when compared to APLA- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that brain abnormalities can be detected in PAPLS patients with non-conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MRI reveals more profound injury in patients with MS versus PAPLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>APLA mediates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cerebral pathology that remains to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
