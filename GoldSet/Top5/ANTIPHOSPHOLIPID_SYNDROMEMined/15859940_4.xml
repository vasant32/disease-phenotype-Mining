<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In postrenal transplantation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> is often a reflection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases were related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and 1 case was secondary to both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and tacrolimus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fifth case had features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> related to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other causes include drug-related (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found that the most-frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> was drug related, secondary mainly to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%) </plain></SENT>
