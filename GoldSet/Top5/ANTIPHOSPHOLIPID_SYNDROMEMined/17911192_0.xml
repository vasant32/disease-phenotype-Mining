<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are many studies that are available on the Internet that attempt to standardize the assay for anticardiolipin antibody evaluation because of the variability of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate simultaneously the role of different microplates and the importance of sample nonspecific binding in determining different results in anticardiolipin antibody detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 8 patients with raised levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies and 10 control sera were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the presence (specific binding) or in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (sample blank) with four different microplates, that is, NUNC PolySorp, FALCON ProBIND, Greiner 655061 (high binding), and Greiner 655001 (medium binding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as optical densities or net-optical densities (following sample blank subtraction) as well as international IgG anticardiolipin units (GPL) or net-GPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A wide interplate variability of optical densities was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When results were expressed as GPL, significant differences were only found between Greiner 655061, FALCON ProBIND, and NUNC PolySorp (P &lt; .05 and P &lt; .001, respectively) whereas differences were not statistically significant if interplate variability was analyzed as net-GPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results expressed as categorical variables (ie, positive/negative, according to a GPL cut-off and net-GPL cut-off, obtained with sera from 100 apparently healthy blood donors) showed a good or excellent Cohen's kappa coefficient of concordance among plates when positivity was evaluated on net-GPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that quantification and subtraction of sample blank may improve both interlaboratory agreement and reliability of anticardiolipin assay and minimize false-positive results </plain></SENT>
