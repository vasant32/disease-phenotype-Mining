<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of olaquindox (OLA) as an additive in animal feedstuffs has been prohibited in the European Union and many other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a highly sensitive and specific indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of OLA in animal feed samples was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OLA was activated by N'N-carbonyldiimidazole and coupled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin (OVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the sensitivity and specificity of the two antisera were very similar, with the IC(50) values of 16 ng mL(-1) and 19 ng mL(-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity was less than 35% for four structurally related compounds and no recognition of five other antibiotics was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The better antiserum I was selected for further experiments, for example testing stability, solvent effect, accuracy, and precision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IC(50) value for eight standard curves was in the range 12-18 ng mL(-1) and the LOD at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) was 0.31 +/- 0.11 ng mL(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ELISA tolerated 5% <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> without significant influence on IC(50) value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recoveries of spiked OLA in five different animal feed types including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22676">auxin</z:chebi>, pig complex feed, fish complex feed, broiler concentrated feed, and pig premix feed were in the range 88.3-119.0% and the intra-assay relative standard deviation (RSD) was within 4.7-33.5% (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ELISA for unspiked feed samples was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with a high correlation coefficient of 0.9862 (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proposed ELISA could be a feasible quantitative/screening method for OLA analysis in feed samples with the properties of high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity of sample pretreatment, high sample throughput, and low expense </plain></SENT>
