<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) have been shown to activate endothelial cells (EC) in vitro, as documented by an increased expression of tissue factor as well as leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules such as intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, treatment of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> includes aspirin, particularly for women with recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate whether aspirin interferes with EC activation induced by APLA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG from 14 patients with APLA, and suffering from thrombotic complications and/or pregnancy morbidity, and control IgG were tested for their ability to modify the expression of VCAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 antigen was measured by flow cytometry and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incubation of EC with IgG from most of the patients led to a higher VCAM-1 expression compared with incubation with control IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of aspirin was studied for the eight IgG samples that induced a more than 50% increase in VCAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin (10 mm) treatment of the cells significantly reduced the VCAM-1 response to these APLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that besides its antiplatelet properties, aspirin exerts a protective effect towards APLA at the EC level by decreasing leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
