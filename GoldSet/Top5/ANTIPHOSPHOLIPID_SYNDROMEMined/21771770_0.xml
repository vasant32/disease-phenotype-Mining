<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in obstetrics, information on its pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing during each trimester pregnancy is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize IVIG pharmacokinetics in pregnant women with a history of idiopathic secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> or obstetrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and to make dosing recommendations by comparing serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations in women receiving IVIG to placebo controls, before and during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Women enrolled in an IVIG trial for idiopathic secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (n = 25) or an IVIG study for obstetrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n = 10); 22 received IVIG 0.5-1.0 g/kg and 13 received the equivalent volume of saline, every 4 weeks from pre-pregnancy until 18-20 weeks of gestation, with dosing adjusted for her weight prior to each infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG concentrations were measured by rate nephelometry before and 0.5 h, and 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks following an infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sampling was performed pre-pregnancy and in the first and second trimesters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Area under the curve (AUC) did not differ significantly within the IVIG group between the three sampling periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated contributions of IVIG [calculated as mean AUC (IVIG group) minus mean AUC (control group)] were 4890.8 g h/l pre-pregnancy, 5591.4 g h/l first trimester and 4755.1 g h/l second trimester (P&gt; 0.05, non-significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the IVIG 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg subgroups, the overall estimated contribution of exogenous IVIG was ~4000 and ~6400 g h/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With a weight-adjusted dosage of IVIG, drug exposure, based on AUC calculations, was maintained at the pre-pregnancy level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we recommend a weight-adjusted dosage of IVIG during the first and second trimesters </plain></SENT>
