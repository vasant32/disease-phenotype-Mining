<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) bind the self antigen N-terminal domain (domain I) of beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), with residues G40-R43 being important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> homologous to other regions of domain I have also been shown to bind aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there are no published reports of the effects of altering R39, which has greater surface exposure than the G40-R43 residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a novel, efficient method of production and purification of human domain I by Escherichia coli to create multiple mutants of domain I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These domain I mutants were then screened for binding to a range of polyclonal IgG purified from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, using both solid-phase and fluid-phase assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: E coli-expressed purified domain I selectively bound IgG derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In region R39-R43, the R39S mutation had the greatest effect in terms of reducing binding to a panel of aPL in the fluid phase (mean +/- SD inhibition 14 +/- 18.5% versus 44.1 +/- 31.7% for G40E and 62.9 +/- 25.7% for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> domain I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, altering both D8 and D9 to S8 and G9, respectively, had the effect of enhancing binding to aPL in the fluid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adding the remainder of the domain I-II interlinker resulted in enhanced binding over <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> in the solid phase but not the fluid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The binding of aPL to beta(2)GPI domain I is complex and likely to involve discontinuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> that include R39 in addition to G40-R43, the domain I-II interlinker, and possibly D8 and D9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Domain I variants with enhanced binding to aPL compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> domain I may aid in the development of novel therapies </plain></SENT>
