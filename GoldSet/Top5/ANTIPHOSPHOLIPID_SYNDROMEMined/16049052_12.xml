<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different modes of research funding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The payback framework was applied to 16 case studies of research grants funded in the early 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case study methodology included bibliometric analysis, literature and archival document review and key informant interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A range of research paybacks was identified from the 16 research grants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The payback included 302 peer-reviewed papers, postgraduate training and career development, including 28 PhD/MDs, research informing recommendations in clinical guidelines, improved quality of life for people with RA and the reduction of the likelihood of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> for women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The payback arising from project grants appeared to be similar to that arising from other modes of funding that were better resourced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide diversity of research payback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short focused project grants seem to provide value for money </plain></SENT>
