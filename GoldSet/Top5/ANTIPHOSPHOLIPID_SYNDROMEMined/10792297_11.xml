<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether genetic determinants contribute to their thrombotic risk, we studied the prevalence of the G1691 --&gt; A mutation in the gene coding for factor V, the G20210 --&gt; A mutation in the prothrombin gene and the C677 --&gt; T mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene in 152 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>History of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was present in 96 patients (63%); 67 suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> only, 23 cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> only, six patients had both venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were heterozygous for the G1691 --&gt; A mutation in the factor V gene (3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the G20210 --&gt; A mutation in the prothrombin gene was evaluated in 145 patients; eight of these patients were heterozygous (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients (50%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> compared with 65 out of the 137 patients without the mutation (47%) (P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither mutation was associated with arterial thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient carried both mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The C677 --&gt; T mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene was assessed in 83 patients; 15 of them (18%) were homozygous and 37 (44%) were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between the status of the mutation and history of venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, only the G1691 --&gt; A mutation in the factor V gene was associated with the thrombotic risk of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
