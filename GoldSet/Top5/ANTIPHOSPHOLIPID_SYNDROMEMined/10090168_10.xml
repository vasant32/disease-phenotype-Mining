<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) and are associated with recurrent thromboses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of aPL antibodies is routinely tested using a standardized ELISA that utilizes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> as antigen (aCL ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This test, although sensitive, is frequently positive in patients with nonrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> and some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>, making the test less specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus there is a need for more specific tests for aCL with equivalent sensitivity to the standard assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the diagnostic utility of a new aPL antibody test kit with a unique <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> mixture designed to be more specific than the standard anticardiolipin ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aPL antibodies (IgG, IgM) were measured by both a standard ELISA and a new ELISA kit (APhL ELISA Kit, Louisville APL Diagnostics, Inc., Louisville, KY, USA) in the baseline serum from patients enrolled in a 5 year inception cohort, prospective study of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatoid diseases</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (N = 70), SLE (70), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (45), inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (36), and early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> (CTD) (165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was based on standardized criteria and determined at the last study visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A nested group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (44) was also defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum from 200 blood donors (BD) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with known APS (33) and antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody positive renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (52) were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laboratory personnel were blinded to sample diagnostic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The kit was 90.9% sensitive for detecting APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven patients missed by the kit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had standard aCL values &lt; 40 PL units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Assuming controls do not have APS, the kit was 99.5% specific vs 96.0% for the standard assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For the patients with CTD, the kit never detected a patient that was not also detected by the standard aCL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The APhL ELISA Kit appears to be more specific than the standard aCL ELISA without adding potential false positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The new test may be useful for followup study for patients found to be aCL positive by standard assays to increase specificity for aCL screening </plain></SENT>
