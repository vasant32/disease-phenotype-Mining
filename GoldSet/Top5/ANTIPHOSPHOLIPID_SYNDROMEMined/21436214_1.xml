<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published guidelines are, however, inconsistent, and evidence regarding the interference is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was investigate IgM and IgA RF cross-reactivity and/or interference in IgM and IgA aCL and anti-β2 glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI) testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum specimens with high IgM and IgA RF levels were tested for IgG, IgA and IgM aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies to examine cross-reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples containing IgG aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies were spiked with IgM (and IgA) RF, and samples with high RF levels were spiked with IgG aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mixtures were tested for IgM and IgA aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specimens with high IgM and IgA RF concentrations did not test positive for IgM or IgA aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies (except one weak positive IgA aβ2GPI result), indicating the lack of cross-reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the spiked specimens, addition of IgM RF caused significant positive bias in the measurement of both aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies of IgM isotype in the presence of IgG aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The threshold for triggering significant interference was 318( )IU/ml for IgM RF, and 77 GPLU/ml for IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither IgM, nor IgA RF, however, affected the IgA antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IgM RF can cause a false-positive IgM aCL result in the presence of IgG aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In studies on the prevalence and clinical significance of IgM aPL antibodies, RF interference should be considered and RF testing should be performed </plain></SENT>
