<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) have been found in about 10% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and have been associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations (NPSLE), including cerebrovascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> in patients with SLE, previous and further risk of neuropsychiatric manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and nine consecutive patients with previous diagnosis of SLE and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological manifestations were evaluated clinically and by transcranial Doppler monitoring (1 hour) from November 2002 to March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed during a mean time of 4.5 years, to detect the appearance of NPSLE, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected in 16 patients (14.7%; range: 3-64/h); at baseline, previous neuropsychiatric manifestations were more frequent in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>: 12/16 (75%) versus 46/92 (50%) (p=0.064), especially for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> (p=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> did not differ between groups at baseline and follow-up, neither the proportion of patients on antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, two patients from the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> positive group and six from the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> negative group developed a new neuropsychiatric manifestation (p=not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study supports an association of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> and a history of NPSLE, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and other neurological manifestations at follow-up </plain></SENT>
