<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously we reported that the variable heavy chain region (VH) of a human beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-dependent monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (IS4) was dominant in conferring the ability to bind <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the identity of the paired variable light chain region (VL) determined the strength of CL binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examine the importance of specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> in IS4VH and paired VL in CL binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH and VL sequences was altered by site-directed mutagenesis or by CDR exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten different 2a2 germline gene-derived VL sequences were expressed with IS4VH and the VH of an anti-dsDNA antibody, B3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six variants of IS4VH, containing different patterns of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> in CDR3, were paired with B3VL and IS4VL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability of the 32 expressed heavy chain/light chain combinations to bind CL was determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> in IS4VH CDR3 substituted to serines, two residues at positions 100 and 100 g had a major influence on the strength of CL binding while the two residues at positions 96 and 97 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In CDR exchange studies, VL containing B3VL CDR1 were associated with elevated CL binding, which was reduced significantly by substitution of a CDR1 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> at position 27a with serine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> in VL CDR2 or VL CDR3 did not enhance CL binding, and in one case may have contributed to inhibition of this binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subsets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residues</z:chebi> at specific locations in the CDRs of heavy chains and light chains of pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are important in determining their ability to bind CL </plain></SENT>
