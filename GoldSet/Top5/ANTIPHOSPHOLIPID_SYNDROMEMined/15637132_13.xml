<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> are common manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to clarify the roles of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (aPL) antibodies in the pathogenesis of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-CL/beta2-GPI) antibody concentrations, anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) antibody concentrations, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity in 87 patients with SLE (21 with VTE and 66 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both anti-CL/beta2-GPI and anti-PS/PT antibodies strongly correlated with LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed that both anti-CL/beta2-GPI and anti-PS/PT antibodies were significant independent risk factors for VTE (odds ratios = 4.98 and 7.54, respectively; 95% confidence intervals, 1.51-16.4 and 2.30-24.7, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the in vitro effects of IgG fractions containing anti-CL/beta2-GPI or anti-PS/PT antibodies on the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of activated protein C (APC) and found that purified IgG containing anti-CL/beta2-GPI or anti-PS/PT antibodies significantly hampered the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also studied the ability of IgG fractions to impede the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity of APC before and after complete removal of anti-CL/beta2-GPI or anti-PS/PT antibodies by adsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Removal of anti-CL/beta2-GPI or anti-PS/PT antibodies from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> positive IgG samples clearly decreased the inhibitory effect of those samples on APC <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CL/beta2-GPI and anti-PS/PT antibodies independently cause APC resistance, which may contribute to risk of VTE in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
