<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, a total of 191 lupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-negative pregnant women with primary APS were retrospectively divided into three groups: aCL(+) /aβ2GPI(-) ; aCL(+) /aβ2GPI(+) ; aCL(-) /aβ2GPI(+)  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> rate in the double-positive group was significantly higher than that in the aCL(+) /aβ2GPI(-) group (46.2% vs. 22.1%, p &lt; 0.05); the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> rate in the aCL(-) /aβ2GPI(+) group (36.4%) was not significantly different from the rates of the other two groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, double-positivity may be a risk factor for pregnancy loss and aβ2GPI antibody may be a better prognostic marker than aCL antibody for pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
