<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The APC resistance genotype was assessed using a PCR-based analysis for the factor V R506Q (Leiden) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient with primary APS was found to be heterozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He and other family members were affected by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and had a familial form of primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APC resistance phenotype was assessed by measuring the prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin clotting time in response to APC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found in five out of six patients with APS, in one of them transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have found that the APC resistance phenotype is more frequent than the genotype in primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It would seem that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> should be investigated for APC resistance even if found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
