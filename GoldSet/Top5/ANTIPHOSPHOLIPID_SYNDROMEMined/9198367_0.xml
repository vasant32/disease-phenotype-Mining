<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 25-year-old woman complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012050'>anasarca</z:hpo> and was admitted to Sakura National hospital on the presumptive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> with 10.7 g of 24-hour urinary protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At first, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome was suspected because of prolongation of APTT, existence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and elevation of serum anticardiolipin antibody titer (IgM) in addition to positive ANA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> and the biologically false positive test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> (BFPTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On day 28 of hospitalization, renal biopsy findings revealed severe endocapillary cell damage, such as swelling and proliferation of endothelial cells, fragmentation and double contour of the basement membrane walls, which were located only in the capillary lumens with a few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent micrography revealed the absence of specific immunoglobulin or complement deposit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> was negated as these findings were suggestive of characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathy</z:hpo> due to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was treated initially with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 60 mg and intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> 20,000 units daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 750 mg was administered intravenously as pulse therapy on day 13 as her serum level of CH50 had fallen suddenly, and hemodialysis was necessary because her renal function had deteriorated and she was suffering from cough and orthopnea with overhydratin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the combined therapy, BFPTS disappeared and APTT returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: dialysis treatment was not required further after the 4th hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, renal function improved and complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient was a case of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome in which endothelial cell damage was located exclusively in the capillary lumens and pulse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy in addition to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We present this instructive case to promote understanding of the pathogenesis of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
