<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available on the contribution of hypercoagulable status in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to report the prevalence of inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors (TF) in patients with primary (effort-related and spontaneous) UEDVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1993 to 2002, 31 patients (17 females, median age 38.8 years, range 16-60 years; and 14 males, median age 31.4 years, range 20-56 years) with primary UEDVT (n = 15 effort-related and n = 16 spontaneous) were referred for screening of hypercoagulable status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (61.3%) patients had at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common acquired TF were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (31% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and 12.9% anticardiolipin antibodies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden (12.9%) and prothrombin G20210A mutation (20%) were the most prevalent genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients (16.1%) had high plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels, and one patient (4.7%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effort-related UEDVT was associated with male gender (P = 0.04) and younger age (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of acquired or inherited TF between patients with effort-related or spontaneous UEDVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A local anatomic abnormality was detected in seven patients (22.5%), and the prevalence of TF was significantly lower within this group (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of TF in patients without an anatomic abnormality was 75% (RR 5.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study found a high prevalence of an underlying thrombophilic status in spontaneous and effort-related UEDVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hypercoagulable status may play a significant role in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening for local anatomical abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> should be included in the evaluation of primary UEDVT </plain></SENT>
