<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The binding characteristics of affinity purified anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathy</z:e> associated with clinically overt APS were studied; inhibition studies were also carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antibodies were used for the active induction of experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The affinity purified anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies were found to bind a target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> created by the complex of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/beta 2GPI, while not reacting with a complex composed by another <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (phosphatidylserine/beta 2GPI), as confirmed by direct binding and competition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunization of naive mice with this unique affinity purified anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody resulted in the induction of experimental APS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, prolonged coagulation timed and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorptions</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/beta 2GPI injected mice developed high titers of mouse anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/beta 2GPI antibodies with the same binding characteristics as the human antibody which was used for disease induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: APS is a unique syndrome that is characterized by a diversity of pathogenic anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies which may explain the diversity of clinical manifestations reported in patients </plain></SENT>
