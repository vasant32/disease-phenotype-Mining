<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microparticles (MPs) resulting from vesiculation of platelets and other blood cells have been extensively documented in vitro and have been found in increased numbers in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, but little is known about MPs of endothelial origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze morphological, immunological, and functional characteristics of MPs derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by TNF, and to investigate whether these MPs are detectable in healthy individuals and in patients with a prothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy evidenced <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> formation on the membrane of TNF-stimulated HUVECs, leading to increased numbers of MPs released in the supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These endothelial microparticles (EMPs) expressed the same antigenic determinants as the corresponding cell surface, both in resting and activated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPs derived from TNF-stimulated cells induced coagulation in vitro, via a tissue factor/factor VII-dependent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, alphavbeta3, and PECAM-1 suggests that MPs have an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> potential in addition to their procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients, labeling with alphavbeta3 was selected to discriminate EMPs from those of other origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that endothelial-derived MPs are detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood and are increased in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> characterized by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, MPs can be induced by TNF in vitro, and may participate in vivo in the dissemination of proadhesive and procoagulant activities in thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
