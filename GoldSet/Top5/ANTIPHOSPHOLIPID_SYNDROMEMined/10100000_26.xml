<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the binding of affinity-purified immunoglobulin G to human primary trophoblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antibodies affected the invasiveness and differentiation of cytotrophoblast cells after binding to the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined whether the drugs used to treat APS might be able to restore the trophoblast functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly reduced the immunoglobulin G binding to trophoblast cells and restored in-vitro placental invasiveness and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No effect was observed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations may help in understanding the role of these treatments in women with APS </plain></SENT>
