<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the field of pathophysiology, in diagnosis and a greater number of therapeutic options in the treatment of SLE, have made the medical community regard these patients with less trepidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite these advances, however, the risk of significant morbidity to both the mother and the fetus still exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>THE INTERACTION OF LUPUS AND PREGNANCY IS VERY COMPLEX: the consensus is that pregnancy can worsen the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024141" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus disease</z:e> process, even if this is not predictable, and pregnancy can mimic the clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More specifically, pregnancy is associated in 50 to 60% of cases with a clinical flare manifesting as renalor hematological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe flares are uncommon (10%) and the risk of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is now2 to 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of the fetus remains high, however with increased risk of spontaneous fetal wastage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature births</z:hpo>, by 4.8 and 6.8 times, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is well documented that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> are strongly associated with fetal wastage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-dose aspirin orheparin improves fetal outcome in these cases.Timing a pregnancy to coincide with a period of disease quiescence for at least 6 months strongly increases the chances for a healthy and uneventful pregnancy for both mother and baby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Close surveillance, with monitoring of blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and placental blood flow by doppler studies helps the early diagnosis and treatment of complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> andfoetal distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women with SLE frequently need treatment throughout pregnancy based on hydroxychloroquine, lowdose steroids and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This update, based on previous available literature, should inform rheumatologists, obstetricians and neonatologists who guide patients in their reproductive decisions </plain></SENT>
