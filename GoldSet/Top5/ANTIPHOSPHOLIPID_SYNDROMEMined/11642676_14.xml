<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PROBLEM: Pregnancies in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) are associated with obstetric complications despite treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study analyzes risk factors and evaluates fetal outcome in a large sample of treated APS pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Seventy-seven pregnancies in 56 women were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve selected variables potentially related to the outcome of treated pregnancies were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treated women delivered 65 live infants at 24-41 weeks gestation (mean 36.7+/-0.5) but two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were seven first-trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> (9%) and five intrauterine fetal demises (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the probability of having a live baby under treatment was 82% (95% CI 71.3-89.6%), a figure significantly greater (P &lt;0.001) than that observed before therapy (25.7%; 95% CI 18.7-33.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables related with fetal outcome in the multivariate model were: preconceptional use of aspirin and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry at 23-26 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present report shows that in treated APS pregnancies: i) aspirin treatment started preconceptionally is an independent and significant prognostic factor associated with favorable fetal outcome; and ii) abnormal velocity waveforms in the umbilical artery predict adverse outcome of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
