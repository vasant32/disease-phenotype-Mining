<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, they can also be detected in asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that a-β₂GPI against Domain1 (D1) associate with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, while those recognizing Domain4/5 (D4/5) have been identified in non-thrombotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the specificity of a-β₂GPI in different clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 39 one-year-old healthy children born to mothers with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (SAD) (15 (38.4%) were born to mothers who were a-β₂GPI positive), 33 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> (AD) and 55 patients with APS (50 adults and 5 paediatrics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were IgG a-β₂GPI positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG a-β₂GPI were performed by homemade ELISA, while IgG a-β₂GPI D1 and D4/5 were tested on research ELISAs containing recombinant β₂GPI domains antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One-year-old children and AD children displayed preferential reactivity for D4/5; patients with APS recognized preferentially D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found a good correlation between a-β₂GPI and D4/5 in one-year-old (r=0.853) and AD children (r=0.879) and between a-β₂GPI and D1 in the APS group (r=0.575) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic events were recorded in both groups of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A-β₂GPI found in non-thrombotic conditions (healthy children born to mothers with SAD and AD children) mostly recognize D4/5, in contrast to the prevalent specificity for D1 in the APS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The different specificity could at least partially explain the "innocent" profile of a-β₂GPI in children </plain></SENT>
