<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an effort to improve the quantitative detection of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) IgG so as to classify patients correctly as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) positive, we developed a new immunoassay based on a sandwich time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) using the complex of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> plus bovine β(2)GPI as antigen and Eu(3+)-labeled rabbit antihuman IgG as conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precision, sensitivity, specificity, and stability of the assay were evaluated, and comparison with the classical ELISA was also made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aCL IgG TRFIA kit we established had a wider detectable range than three commercial ELISA ones from different manufacturers when a specimen was diluted, with strong positive result from 1:12.5 to 1:204,800 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average intra-assay and inter-assay CVs detected by the aCL IgG TRFIA was 3.14 and 3.70 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity was 0.1 GPL U/ml, and the clinical diagnostic specificity was 98 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The established assay kit also behaved better in stability than the commercial ELISA ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the immunoassay we established correlated well with the ELISA, and the correlation coefficient was 0.975 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that the TRFIA we developed for aCL IgG detection gives promise to a more sensitive and reliable diagnosis of APS and has potential value for large-scale screening programs </plain></SENT>
