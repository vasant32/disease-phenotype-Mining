<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the significance of aPLs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients/methods: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> &lt;48 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traditional aPLs, including anticardiolipin and β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (β2GPI), and newer aPLs, including anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT), β2GPI Domain 4/5 and β2GPI Domain 1 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 90 days or identification of a high risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the presence of clinical/sub-clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Over 4.5 years, 167 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty one patients (25%) had the composite endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibodies were measured in 158 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>aPS/PT IgG antibodies were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR 16.3, 95% CI 2.3-116.7, p = 0.005) and were non-significantly associated with the composite endpoint (OR 4.7, 95% CI 0.8-29.2, p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis adjusting for ABCD(2) risk score, aPS/PT IgG remained associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR 15.7, 95% CI 2.0-125.6, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other aPLs were not associated with clinical outcome and no association between APLs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: In contrast to other aPLs, aPS/PT IgG antibodies are independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
