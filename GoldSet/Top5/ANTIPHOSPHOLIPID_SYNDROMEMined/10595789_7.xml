<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>New evidence indicates that antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) or to human prothrombin (anti-II)(or to both of these) are specific markers of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have been mainly associated with thrombotic complications in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some studies have reported that elevated levels of anti-II, but not of anfi-beta2GPI, imply a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (AT) in subjects with no previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study Included 180 patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 83 of them without aPL (group I) and the remaining 97 diagnosed as having APS (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI was found in only 1 of the 83 patients from group I but was found in approximately 50% of those from group II (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, positive anti-II was detected with a high prevalence in patients from group I (VT, 22.6%; AT, 26.7%) and in those from group II (VT, 37.5%; AT, 14.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences were found in the prevalence of anti-II between the two groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, such a difference was significant when compared with results in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (1/67, 1.4%, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data Indicate that anti-II occurs frequently in patients with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> either with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, testing of anti-II might be clinically useful in the evaluation for thrombophilla </plain></SENT>
