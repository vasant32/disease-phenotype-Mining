<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study enrolled 72 subjects (26 patients with APS (mean age 45.5 +/- 10.2 years) and their 46 relatives, including 37 and 9 first- and- second-degree relatives, respectively; mean age 29.5 +/- 16.4 years) from 26 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A battery of standardized tests was used to evaluate the hemostatic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the examination, most relatives were found to have signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>: activated intravascular coagulation and suppressed fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high detection rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) amongst the relatives of patients with APS (39.1%) is likely to suggest its heritability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed the prognostic value of thrombocytic aggregatory disorders in the development of hemorrhagic manifestations, as well as an association of LA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
