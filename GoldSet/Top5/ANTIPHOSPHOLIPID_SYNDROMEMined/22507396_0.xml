<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-term allograft survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APAS) patients as well as patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> but no thrombotic complications remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates long-term allograft survival of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> as well as patients with APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the study period from January 1, 1992 through May 31, 2009, 1625 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> awaiting renal transplants were screened for APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four (5.8%) of these patients had circulating levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and 39 of these patients had documented evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> and were diagnosed with APAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with APAS received transplants on either low molecular weight (LMW) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> as anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 94 patients with only ACA, 46 received renal transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 1492 patients, 1285 patients with no evidence of either ACA or APAS received renal transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten-yr allograft survival of patients with APAS treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> was similar to those treated with LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (18% vs. 20%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, those allograft survivals were significantly lower than those patients positive for ACA (28%) alone (ACA vs. LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">Coumadin</z:chebi> p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation therapies, patients with APAS have lower long-term graft survival than those patients who have circulating ACA but no APAS </plain></SENT>
