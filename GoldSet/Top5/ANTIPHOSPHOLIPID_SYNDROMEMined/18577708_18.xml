<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38068">antimalarial</z:chebi> drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been associated with reduced risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the antiphospholipid (aPL) syndrome (APS) and, in an animal model of APS, with reduction of experimentally induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recognition of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) by aPL antibodies appears to play a major role in the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore used the techniques of ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate whether HCQ directly affects the formation of aPL IgG-beta2GPI complexes on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HCQ, at concentrations of 1 mug/mL and greater, significantly reduced the binding of aPL-beta2GPI complexes to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surfaces and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 (human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004845'>acute monocytic leukemia</z:hpo> cell line) monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The drug also reduced the binding of the individual proteins to bilayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This HCQ-mediated reduction of binding was completely reversed when the HCQ-protein solutions were dialyzed against buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HCQ also caused modest, but statistically significant, reductions of clinical antiphospholipid assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HCQ reduces the formation of aPL-beta2GPI complexes to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayers and cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect appears to be due to reversible interactions between HCQ and the proteins and may contribute to the observed reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in human and experimental APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the possibility that HCQ, or analogous molecules, may offer novel nonanticoagulant therapeutic strategies for treating APS </plain></SENT>
