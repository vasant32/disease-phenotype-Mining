<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the prevalence of antibeta2GPI antibodies and their clinical impact in patients with a history of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) without LA/anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), we studied 503 patients [128 (36.2%) men, median age 41 years (interquartile range, IQR 28-54 years)] with previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 113 individuals without VTE [43 (38.1%) men, age 46.7 years (IQR 38-52 years)] served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 418 patients without LA/ACA, anti-beta2GPI-IgG levels were elevated in seven (1.7%), -IgM in 15 (3.6%) and -IgA in 14 (3.3%) cases; in 58 patients with ACA, anti-beta2GPI-IgG levels were elevated in two (3.4%), six (10.3%) and three (5.2%), and in 27 with LA, they were elevated in 18 (66.7%), 19 (70.4%) and 10 (37%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the prevalence of elevated anti-beta2GPI antibodies was not increased in patients without LA/ACA but was strongly associated with LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without ACA/LA who had a recurrent event did not have higher prevalence of elevated anti-beta2GPI-IgG, -IgM or -IgA antibodies than those without a recurrent event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, elevated antibeta2GPI antibodies are not likely to be a predictor of recurrent events in patients without LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that determination of anti-beta2GPI antibodies does not improve the clinical management of patients with a history of VTE without LA/ACA </plain></SENT>
