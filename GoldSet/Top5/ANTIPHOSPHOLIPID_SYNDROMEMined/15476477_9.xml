<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied a cohort of 337 patients who underwent renal transplantation from 1996 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up continued until allograft loss, patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or 31 December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-censored allograft loss or a 25% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 1-month post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were allograft loss, a 25% reduction in GFR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM ACA titers were positive (&gt; or =15) in 18.1% of recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences at baseline between recipients, except <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> therapy in those with positive ACA titers (20% vs. 7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant, there was no increase in the primary outcome in ACA-positive patients, even after adjustment for anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10034">coumadin</z:chebi> (HR = 1.42 [0.68, 2.96]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in secondary outcomes between those with or without positive titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of five patients with very high titers (&gt;50) who were not anticoagulated had early graft loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive ACA titer prior to kidney transplantation was not associated with inferior renal outcomes after transplantation, although more research is required to address the prognostic significance of very high ACA titers </plain></SENT>
