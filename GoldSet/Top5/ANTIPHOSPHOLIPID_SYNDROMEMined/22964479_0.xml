<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we further explored the roles of TLR4 and its adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF, in anti-β(2)GPI/β(2)GPI-induced the activation of human blood monocytes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells and the relationship among TLR4, β(2)GPI and ANX2 in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that treatment of monocytes or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells with anti-β(2)GPI/β(2)GPI complex could increase TF, MyD88, TRIF as well as TNF-α (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha) expression </plain></SENT>
