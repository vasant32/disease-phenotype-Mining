<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain however whether these antibodies play a direct role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or are merely epiphenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> might play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we utilized a novel mouse model in which the dynamics of in vivo <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD1 mice (26-30 g) were passively immunized with 25 mg of human IgG from a patient with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS) (n = 17), IgG from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pooled sera (IgG-NHS) (n = 9), or saline solution (n = 12), followed by 40 mg of the same preparations at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 72 h, levels of human aPL antibodies, detected using the anticardiolipin ELISA test (aCL ELISA test), in mice immunized with IgG-APS, were 50-100 GPL units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each animal was anesthetized, femoral vein minimally mobilized and subjected to a standardized "pinch" injury to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vessel was transilluminated using acrylic optical fibers connected to a light source, and clot formation and dissolution were visualized by a standard surgical microscope equipped with a video camera, video recorder, and computer assisted analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that average clot size was significantly larger in mice immunized with IgG-APS compared to those treated with saline (p &lt; 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> persisted longer in a significantly higher number of mice immunized with IgG-APS (10/17) compared to mice immunized with IgG-NHS (1/9) or saline (2/12) (p &lt; 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
