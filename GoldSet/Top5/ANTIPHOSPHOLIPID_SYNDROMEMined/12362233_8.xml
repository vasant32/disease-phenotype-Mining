<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role(s) of anti-beta(2) GPI antibodies on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndromes (APS), the effect of IgG from three patients on activated protein C (APC) was investigated using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles and purified proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of the total IgG inhibited APC activity in the presence of beta(2)GPI, whereas the third IgG did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, one IgG inhibited APC activity without beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta(2)GPI IgG from the two inhibitory IgG preparations inhibited APC activity only in the presence of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition was suppressed partially by excess APC and almost completely by excess <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cleaved beta(2)GPI, a non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding form, did not support inhibitory activity, even though the anti-beta(2)GPI IgG bound to the cleaved molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms that anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies from APS patients inhibit APC activity, and demonstrates the requirement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding of beta(2)GPI for expression of the inhibitory activity of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
