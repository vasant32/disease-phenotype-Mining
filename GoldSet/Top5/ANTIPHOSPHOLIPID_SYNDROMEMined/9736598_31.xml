<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of beta2GPI immunization on the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the first experiment, 3 groups of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor-deficient (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-RD) mice (n=15 per group) were immunized with either beta2GPI or ovalbumin or were not immunized and were fed a chow diet for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second experiment, 3 groups of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-RD mice (n=10 per group) were immunized similarly and fed an atherogenic diet for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> beta2GPI-immunized mice developed high titers of anti-beta2GPI antibodies as well as a specific lymph node proliferation to beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average cholesterol levels did not differ between the mice fed similar diets, regardless of the immunization protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was enhanced in the beta2GPI-immunized mice (mean aortic lesion, 26 000+/-5700 microm2) in comparison with their ovalbumin-immunized (mean, 3000+/-1099 microm2; P&lt;0.01) and nonimmunized (mean, 2250+/-700 microm2; P&lt;0.01) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average lesion size in the beta2GPI-immunized mice fed an atherogenic diet (mean, 98 000+/-8305 microm2) was larger than the ovalbumin-immunized mice (mean, 81 250+/-12 933 microm2; P=NS) or the nonimmunized controls (mean, 75 625+/-7281 microm2; P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The atherosclerotic plaques in the beta2GPI-immunized mice appeared to be more mature, and denser infiltration of CD4 lymphocytes was present in the subendothelium of the aortic sinuses from this group of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide the first direct evidence for the proatherogenic effect of ss2GPI immunization and establish a new model for immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
