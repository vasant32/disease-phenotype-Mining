<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has to be kept in mind that the magnitude of risk is not only defined by the number of events per time period but also by the impact of the event on the fate of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With standard intensity <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">Vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is more closely related to comorbidities than to other factors, e.g. age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk of VTE recurrence differs largely between patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The criterion of presence, or absence of a permanent or transient clinical trigger factor for the actual VTE episode has a greater impact than an abnormal result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standard period ofsecondary prophylaxis for proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> is three to six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concept of prolonging this period for several months according to the risk of recurrence is seriously challanged by the observation that the prolongation period seems to delay recurrencies rather than truly avoiding them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this reason, patients who clearly are threatened by recurrent episodes should receive indefinitive secondary prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the case for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and those who belong to families with severe and symptomatic protein C, protein S, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiencies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent VTE, with idiopathic VTE, or with combined thrombophilic conditions may only benefit from indefinitive secondary prophylaxis if the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> regimen under consideration is very low </plain></SENT>
