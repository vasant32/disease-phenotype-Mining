<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case in which neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> led to a diagnosis in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> caused by cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is relatively rare in the neonatal period and is often secondary to indwelling intravascular catheters that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, but may be associated with many conditions.1 Cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in newborns, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) were found in the mother, has been described in three case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these premature infants were born with other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> could not be identified in any of these three infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the two cases reported by Silver et al the diagnosis was made several months after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case is unique in the fact that no other risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could be identified to explain the infarction, and that <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were found in the offspring of an apparently healthy mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the prior fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was caused by <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> in her child led to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome in her </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that in case of cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a neonate, with no trivial cause such as an indwelling catheter or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, both mother and infant should be tested for presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, even when the mother seems healthy </plain></SENT>
