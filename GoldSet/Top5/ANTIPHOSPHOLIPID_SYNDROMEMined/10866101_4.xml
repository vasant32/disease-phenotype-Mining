<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study shows that autoantibodies (IgG) directed against modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> were increased in 71 patients positive for anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a representative subgroup of these patients (n = 36) PON1 activity was dramatically decreased and the prevalence of the RR genotype of this enzyme tended to be increased in patients who had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
