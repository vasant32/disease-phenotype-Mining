<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this prothrombotic tendency are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we determined plasma levels of the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in 34 patients with APS (median age 40 years) compared with 180 healthy controls and with 80 age-matched <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients in whom the diagnosis of APS had been excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic cytokines were quantified at least 6 months after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VEGF levels were similar in the patients and controls, but were significantly higher in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> than in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of SDF-1 and PlGF were significantly elevated in the patients, regardless of the arterial/venous nature of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that APS is associated with an angiogenic process, but that the angiogenic signal differs between patients with arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
