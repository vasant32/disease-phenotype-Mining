<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there are characteristic histological features in placentas from ongoing pregnancies of patients with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e>, with and without primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, in relation to clinical pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients attending a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> clinic were investigated and treated according to an established protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients achieving a potentially viable pregnancy (at least 24 completed weeks' gestation), including 60 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-positive cases and 61 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-negative cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After delivery, placental pathologic examination was carried out by a pathologist unaware of the clinical details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological sections were examined by two pathologists independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy outcome and placental findings were reviewed in relation to the maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pregnancy outcome was similar in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-positive and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-negative groups regarding gestation at delivery and antepartum obstetric complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several histological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> were identified in both groups, but most pregnancies were clinically uncomplicated, with no significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e>, the placental pathology was primarily that of uteroplacental vasculopathy, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011416'>placental infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, but there were no specific placental lesions or patterns of abnormalities characteristic of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A small subgroup of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome-positive patients may be at increased risk of development of maternal floor infarction or massive perivillus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are no specific histopathologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_100'>placental abnormalities</z:mpath> characteristic of treated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and poor reproductive history, but complications of uteroplacental disease are more common </plain></SENT>
