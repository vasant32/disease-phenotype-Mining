<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the cytokine profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macrophage activation syndrome</z:e> (MAS) in relation to underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical features and laboratory data of 18 patients with MAS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin 18 (IL-18), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha, interleukin 6, interferon-gamma, ferritin, and beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were compared between underlying diseases and between those who died and those who recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 18 patients with MAS, 9 had underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 7 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Still's disease</z:e> (AOSD), 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients with SLE and 1 patient with RA died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum M-CSF and IL-18 levels were substantially elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with SLE, the M-CSF level was higher than the IL-18 level (median: 4879 vs 1341 pg/ml, p = 0.0054), and it was the reverse in the patients with AOSD (5883 vs 228,350 pg/ml, p = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum M-CSF and beta2m levels were significantly higher in the patients who died than in those who recovered (M-CSF: 18,245 vs 3404 pg/ml, p = 0.019; beta2m: 18.8 vs 5.4 mg/dl, p = 0.0058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cytokine profiles associated with MAS differed between patients with SLE and patients with AOSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with SLE showed a prominent increase in serum M-CSF levels, as did the patients with AOSD in serum IL-18 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who died had higher serum M-CSF and ss(2)m levels, and this suggests that aggressive treatment for patients with MAS and these profiles should be promptly started </plain></SENT>
