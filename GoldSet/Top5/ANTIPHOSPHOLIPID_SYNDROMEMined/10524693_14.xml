<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study of French Caucasians included 171 unrelated patients with SLE, 88 unrelated patients with primary APS, and 193 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SLE group comprised 89 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> SLE and 82 patients with familial SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' and controls' DNA were genotyped for the various alleles of a polymorphic CA <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat located within the promoter region of PARP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed for the distribution of PARP alleles between the healthy control group and each patient group or the pooled SLE patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study findings strongly suggest that these alleles do not influence susceptibility to SLE or primary APS in French Caucasians </plain></SENT>
