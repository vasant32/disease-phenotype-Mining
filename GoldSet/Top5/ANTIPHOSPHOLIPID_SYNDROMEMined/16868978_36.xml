<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Results of previous studies suggest that anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2GPI) antibodies in complex with beta2GPI activate platelets in a dysregulated manner, potentially contributing to the prothrombotic tendency associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to investigate the possible contribution of the GPIb-IX-V receptor to platelet activation mediated by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro methods were used in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction between beta2GPI and the GPIbalpha subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor was delineated using direct binding and competitive inhibition assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interaction between the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex and platelets was studied using a novel method in which the Fc portion of the antibody was immobilized using protein A coated onto a microtiter plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation was assessed by two methods; one involved measuring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> production and the other involved assessment of the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase 3beta intracellular signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the GPIbalpha receptor to platelet activation induced by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex was assessed by observing the influence of 2 anti-GPIbalpha antibodies (AK2 and SZ2) directed against distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study showed that beta(2)GPI could bind to the GPIbalpha receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex was able to activate platelets, and this effect was inhibited by anti-GPIbalpha antibody directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> Leu-36<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32668">-Gln</z:chebi>-59, but not by anti-GPIbalpha antibody directed against residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings show that inappropriate platelet activation by the anti-beta2GPI antibody-beta2GPI complex via the GPIbalpha receptor may contribute to the prothrombotic tendency associated with APS </plain></SENT>
