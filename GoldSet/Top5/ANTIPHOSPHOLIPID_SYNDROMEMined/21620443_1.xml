<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies involved in these disorders are mainly those directed against β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2)GPI) with the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> apparently located on discontinuous antigen with several parts of Domain I (DmI) involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relation between anti-DmI antibodies and patients' risk categories is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The synthetic full-length and correctly-folded DmI (1-64) to set up a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays (ELISA) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma of 22 patients with APS and triple positivity [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> positive (LAC+), IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> positive (aCL+), IgG anti-β(2)GPI positive (a β(2)GPI +)], 15 with double positivity (IgG aCL+, IgG aβ(2)GPI+), 9 with single positivity (IgG aβ(2)GPI+) and 20 controls were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median of percentage inhibition was 25.5% [interquartile range (IQR)17.2-33.0] in triple positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower inhibition was observed in patients with double positivity, median inhibition 5.0% (IQR 0.0-27.0) and in patients with single positivity median inhibition was 2.0% (IQR 0.5-8.0) (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No inhibition was detected in control subjects or using β(2)GPI <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (40-52 and 57-70), or when antithrombin, an insignificant control protein was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High risk patients with APS and triple laboratory positivity as compared with double and single positivity patients have significantly higher titre of anti-DmI antibodies as evaluated by an inhibition test </plain></SENT>
