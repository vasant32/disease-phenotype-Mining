<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes 15 patients who had elevated IgG antibodies reactive with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Outstanding clinical features were: recurrent venous and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>--often extensive and severe--in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, in 11 cases and spontaneous recurrent fetal loss in 8 out of 10 females with marital life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition there were vasospastic/thrombotic features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> and leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Involvement of central and/or peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was present in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>Valvular heart disease</z:hpo> was conspicuous, 10 out of 15 patients (66%) had organic lesions in both sides of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>laboratory abnormalities</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo>, false positive V.D.R.L., plasmatic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> and rheumatoid factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical syndrome seems to be related to the presence of antibodies reactive with anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, although there is not formal proof of a direct cause effects relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these distinct clinical entity is important, the use of simple anti aggregating agents like aspirine and careful <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy may modify the course of this newly recognized autoimmune condition </plain></SENT>
