<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgG/IgM antibodies directed against aPS/PT were assessed in 158 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were detected in 80/158 (50.6%) PAPS patients; IgG alone was positive in 12 (7.6%), IgM alone in 36 (22.8%), and both IgG and IgM isotypes in 32 (20.2%) PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM aPS/PT were significantly associated with both vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG aPS/PT was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.023), whilst IgG and IgM aPS/PT were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that IgM and IgG aPS/PT were independent risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (odds ratio (OR) 3.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-7.9] and OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.4-11.7], respectively) and IgM aPS/PT was an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR 2.7 [95% CI 1.1-6.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these findings indicate that aPS/PT are clinically relevant in PAPS </plain></SENT>
