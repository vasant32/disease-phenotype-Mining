<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence indicates that annexin A2 (A2), a receptor for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen, binds beta(2)GPI on target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, whether A2 mediates pathogenic effects of aPL antibodies in vivo is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, we studied the effects of human aPL antibodies in A2-deficient (A2(-/-)) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A2(-/-) and A2(+/+) mice were injected with immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from either a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS), a healthy control subject (IgG-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum), a monoclonal anti-beta(2)GPI antibody (4C5), an anti-A2 monoclonal antibody, or monoclonal antibody of irrelevant specificity as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that, after IgG-APS or 4C5 injections and vascular injury, mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size was significantly smaller and tissue factor activity was significantly less in A2(-/-) mice compared with A2(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 induced by IgG-APS or 4C5 in explanted A2(-/-) aorta was also significantly reduced compared with A2(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, anti-A2 monoclonal antibody significantly decreased aPL-induced expression of intercellular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor activity on cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate for the first time that A2 mediates the pathogenic effects of aPL antibodies in vivo and in vitro APS </plain></SENT>
