<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This prospective, multicenter trial conducted between 2002 and 2006 included 85 patients aged 18-39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The women were allocated randomly to receive LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin, or IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were compared using the t test and Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The women treated with LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin had a higher rate of live births than those treated with IVIG (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those who completed the study, 29/40 (72.5%) and 15/38 (39.5%), respectively, had live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a significant difference between the 2 groups (OR 1.802; 95%CI, 1.14-2.84; P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LMW <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus low-dose aspirin resulted in a higher live birth rate than IVIG in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
