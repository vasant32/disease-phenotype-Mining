<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Immunology of Habib Bourguiba Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia) during 18months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were the presence of an ANA titer greater or equal to 1/320 with negative characterization result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANA screening was performed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on Hep2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each positive serum was tested by IIF on Crithidia luciliae (anti-native DNA) and by immunodot (anti-nucleosome, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi>, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Scl 70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-Jo1, anti-PCNA and anti-ribosomal protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> patients were tested for anti-Ku, anti-PL7, anti-PL12 and anti-Ro-52 using dot <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sera of 90 patients were studied: 18 men and 72 women (average age: 44years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced ANA was found in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical symptoms were joint (56.7%), cutaneous (54.4%) and constitutional symptoms (45.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> was suspected in 49 patients (54.5%) and confirmed in 30 (33.3%) including 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> (n=6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (n=5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sj√∂gren's syndrome</z:e> (n=3), SLE (n=4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (n=6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The anti-Ku antibody was detected in the majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> was established in 25.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (20%) had no diagnosis orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the diagnostic value of the presence of ANA even in the absence of known antigenic target, confirmed the role of the IIF as "gold standard" test for ANA screening, and suggested the usefulness of the addition of Ku antigen in the immunodot classic profile </plain></SENT>
