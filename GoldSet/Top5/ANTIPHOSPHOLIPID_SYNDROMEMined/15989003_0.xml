<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enzyme immunoassays for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, PCR determination of G1691A mutation in the gene of coagulation factor V, mutation G20210A in prothrombin gene, mutation C677T in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene were made in 97 patients (57 males and 40 females) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> as well as estimation of external and internal coagulation, antithrombin III activity, protein C activity, plasma fibrinogen, stimulated platelet aggregation, blood and plasma viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: APS was detected in 20.6% young and middle-aged patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, in 18.5% of them--primary APS </plain></SENT>
