<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vit.D serum levels of 115 PAPS patients, classified according to the 2006 revised criteria at the Rheumatology Department, Brescia, and of 128 voluntary healthy donors (NHD) were tested in collaboration with DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy) using the LIAISONÂ® chemiluminescent immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were derived from clinical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vit.D deficiency was more prevalent in PAPS than NHD (17% vs 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the summer, vit.D levels were lower in PAPS than NHD (median 28 vs 40.1 ng/mL, P&amp;lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PAPS were subdivided according to clinical characteristics (thrombotic vs obstetric) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups had lower vit.D levels compared to NHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic PAPS had significantly lower levels than obstetric PAPS (median 20.8 vs 33.3, P&amp;lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (14%) received oral 25-OH vit.D supplementation (average 400 UI/die), but 63% of them did not reach serum levels above 30 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAPS showed significantly lower levels of vit.D than NHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510471" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypovitaminosis</z:e> D was seen to cluster in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> which may suggest that the lack of vit.D could be one of the many factors involved in the thrombotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low-dose supplementation did not seem to be effective in a small group of patients </plain></SENT>
