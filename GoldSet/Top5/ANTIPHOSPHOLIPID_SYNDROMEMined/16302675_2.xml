<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a cross-sectional study on PAPS patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody (aCL), IgG anti-beta2glycoprotein-I (anti-beta2GPI), IgG anti-beta2glycoprotein-I complexed to oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) and to a specific oxidized moiety of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (oxLig1), and beta2GPI-oxLDL were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed using pairs of monoclonal antibodies directly labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi>, or phycoerythrin or phycoerythrin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52292">Texas-red-X</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of carotid arteries was determined by high-resolution sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total peripheral blood lymphocytes did not differ between PAPS and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Memory CD4+/CD45RO + T cells were lower in PAPS than controls (P = 0.0007) as well as CD16+56+ natural killer cells (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PAPS memory T CD45RO + cells positively correlated with IgG anti-beta2GPI-oxLigl (P = 0.002) and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of carotid arteries (common carotid P = 0.02, bifurcation P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Naive CD4+/CD45RA+ T cells inversely correlated with beta2GPI-oxLDL (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relation between IgG anti-beta2GPI-oxLig1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of carotid arteries with memory CD45RO + T lymphocytes suggests a role for the latter in PAPS related atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
