<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein we present a patient with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome who developed CAPS manifested by hepatic, renal and splenic artery thromboses, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The course was further complicated by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>haemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two episodes of catastrophic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> developed within 24-36 h after the initiation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, suggesting a role of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in triggering thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient had no anti-platelet-factor-4 antibodies in repeated measurements, making clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> unlikely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible role of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in induction of thromboses and its therapeutic implication are detailed </plain></SENT>
