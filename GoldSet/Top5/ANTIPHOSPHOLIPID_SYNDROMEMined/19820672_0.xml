<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients frequently present APLAs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work is to evaluate pregnancy outcome in SLE patients with and without APLAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 136 gestations in women with SLE diagnosis previous to pregnancy that underwent surveillance in our maternity from 1993 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without APLAs were considered separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal age, obstetric history, SLE activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, present pregnancy evolution, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birth weight and hypertensive complications were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28% (38) of pregnant SLE patients had APLAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these patients, 28.9.8% had past history of second and/or third trimester fetal losses, against 6.12% in patients without APLAs (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of present pregnancy outcome revealed, for APLAs positive patients, a significant higher rate of non-successful pregnancy (8.1% vs 2.1%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mean birth weight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> rates revealed no significant differences related to APLAs presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean gestational age at delivery was 36.9 weeks for both groups with identical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cesarean section was the mode of delivery for 47% and 44.1% of the patients, in APL patients and others, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients with APLAs had more <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> and worse obstetric history, with no other significant differences in perinatal and obstetric outcome </plain></SENT>
