<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We sought to identify the predictors of clinical outcome and of the evolution of cerebral abnormalities in patients with neuropsychiatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with SLE (including 14 with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) who had been hospitalized with primary neuropsychiatric disease were observed prospectively for at least 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laboratory and clinical characteristics and data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies obtained during the hospitalization and 2 years later were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We ascertained nonreversible or new MRI changes and clinical outcomes, including neuropsychiatric events, during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cranial MRI scans on admission were abnormal in 26 (81%) of the 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were more likely to have focal cerebral white matter lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 years, neuropsychiatric deficits substantially improved in 22 (69%) of the patients, stabilized in 6 (19%), and deteriorated in 4 (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of prior neuropsychiatric events was associated with persistent MRI lesions (OR = 4.8 per each event, 95% CI: 1.1 to 21) and unfavorable clinical outcome (OR = 4.3 per each event, 95% CI: 1.4 to 13) at 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> also predicted an unfavorable clinical outcome at 2 years (OR = 11, 95% CI: 1.7 to 65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with SLE who have neuropsychiatric disease, prior neuropsychiatric events and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> increase the risk of adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
