<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(NZW x BXSB) F1 mice were employed as SLE models with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal findings in the ocular fundus were recorded with a fundus camera for small animals (KOWA Co., Ltd.), and the chorioretinal lesions were studied histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in the systemic symptoms of SLE, the incidence of ocular fundus abnormalities in these (NZW x BXSB) F1 mice was significantly higher in males than in females, suggesting the influence of the Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions in the fundus appeared in the form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">white spots</z:e>, which increased in number along with the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion developed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in some animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>Dilatation</z:mpath> of veins and narrowing of arteries were marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These lesions were very similar to multifocal posterior pigment epitheliopathy (MPPE) in humans in that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">white spots</z:e> appear first and then develop into exudative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings included 1. structural destruction of the photoreceptor cell layer, 2. degeneration and loss of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium, and 3. narrowing and occlusion of the choriocapillaris associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, cellular infiltration into the surrounding tissues, and wall thickening of the choroidal arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study of these SLE mouse may contribute to the elucidation of abnormalities in the fundus associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408,C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen diseases</z:e>, including the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
