<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical and serological features of 38 aCL-positive patients were compared to those of 45 aCL-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> was found in aCL-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 13 aCL positive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and/or arterial thromboses and these 13 patients were designated as having the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) while the remaining 70 patients were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APS patients also had a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> compared to SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with high levels of IgG-aCL were more likely to have APS, while patients with low levels of IgG-aCL or IgM-aCL only were more likely to have SLE without the clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since aCL antibodies have recently been shown to interact with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma protein beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta 2-GPI), we measured the beta 2-GPI levels in these patients and found that beta 2-GPI levels are significantly higher in APS compared to SLE patients negative for aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since beta 2-GPI is known to exert multiple effects on coagulation processes the interaction of aCL antibodies with this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> may play a pathogenic role in APS </plain></SENT>
