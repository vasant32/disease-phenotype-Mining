<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of IgA, in addition to IgM and IgG, anti-beta2-GPI and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and to relate the presence of these antibodies to symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 100 blood bank donors (controls) and 48 patients with SLE were tested by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same enzyme conjugates were used in the measurement of aCL and anti-beta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for the presence of manifestations of APS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (deep or superficial), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, repeated fetal loss, leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, avascular bone <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of antibodies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 isotypes against beta2-GPI were found in 5% of controls and 73% of patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in the 2 groups were found in 5 and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgA anti-beta2-GPI was found in 2% of controls and 58% of patients with SLE; in contrast, only 2% of patients with SLE had IgA aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 48 patients studied, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss were present in 10 (Group 1), other manifestations of APS were present in 18 (Group 2), and none in 20 (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to beta2-GPI of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 isotypes were found in a higher proportion of APS (Group 1 plus Group 2) (82%) than in Group 3 (50%) (p &lt; 0.01, chi-squared) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a significantly higher proportion of patients with elevated anti-beta2-GPI in Group 1 (90%) than in Group 3 (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher frequency (p &lt; 0.01) and level (p &lt; 0.05) of IgA anti-beta2-GPI in patients with APS than in those with no APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compared to aCL and with other isotypes of anti-beta2-GPI, the highest antibody levels were observed in IgA antibeta2-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of the anti-beta2-GPI antibody test for APS in patients with SLE is significantly increased by measuring IgA, in addition to IgM and IgG isotype </plain></SENT>
