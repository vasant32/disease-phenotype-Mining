<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When further sera were analyzed it could be shown that &gt; 90% of calpastatin autoantibodies, detected by Western blotting against the partial calpastatin clone, react with the C-terminal amino acids of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an ELISA based on a synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing the C-terminal 27 amino acids of calpastatin was developed and 205 healthy blood donors and 138 random sera from hospital patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 sera (3.2%) were positive with no significant difference between the two groups (7/205 and 4/138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 80 consecutive patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> 9 positive sera (11.3%; p &lt; 0.01 vs. blood donors, p &lt; 0.02 vs. hospital patients) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that autoantibodies against calpastatin may constitute a so far unknown risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
