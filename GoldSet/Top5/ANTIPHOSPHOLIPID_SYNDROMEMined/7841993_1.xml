<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an <z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> in these patients and thus aspirin was found to be effective in abrogating some of the clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to employ the experimentally induced APS in mice infused with anticardiolipin antibodies, to study the effect of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (BMS, 180, 291) on the various overt manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental APS was induced in pregnant female mice by iv infusion of a pathogenic anticardiolipin antibody (CAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mice were then treated daily with 300 micrograms/mouse of BMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group and the untreated group were killed on day 17 of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Live and absorbed fetuses and the mean weight of the placentae, fetuses and platelet counts were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMS treated mice had a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> rate from 45% to 19.8% and an increase in mean placental and embryo weights (182 vs 104, 1043 vs 721 mg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In parallel, an increase in platelet count (from 597,100 to 1075,000 platelets/mm3) and decrease in activated thromboplastin time (95 to 44s) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> may be effective in abrogating the diverse manifestations seen in APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009586'>Increased platelet aggregation</z:mp> may be one of the pathogenetic mechanisms in APS </plain></SENT>
