<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the impedance to uterine artery blood flow, during the midluteal phase, in women with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (RSA) as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fertile controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective study involving women with a history of RSA and fertile controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University of Rome "Tor Vergata." PATIENT(S): Two hundred thirty women with RSA and 50 fertile controls referred for routine examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Transvaginal Doppler examination of uterine arteries during the midluteal phase of untreated cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The mean pulsatility index (PI) of uterine arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Uterine arteries PI values in RSA patients (2.42 +/- 0.79) were significantly higher with respect to those found in the control group (2.08 +/- 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients were grouped according to the different RSA causes, the highest PI values were found among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000130'>uterine abnormalities</z:hpo> (2.82 +/- 1.0), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> syndrome (2.70 +/- 1.1), and unexplained RSA (2.60 +/- 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These values were significantly higher with respect to that found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in PI values between fertile patients and those with RSA due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid abnormalities</z:hpo> (2.10 +/- 0.55), inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (2.03 +/- 0.45), autoimmune pathology (2.34 +/- 1.18), and genetic anomalies (2.47 +/- 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed when patients were grouped according to primary and secondary RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Increased resistance to uterine blood flow may be an important contributing factor to some causes of RSA and may represent an independent indication of the risk of pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
