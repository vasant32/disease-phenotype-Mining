<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether anticardiolipin antibodies induced by immunization with beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I cause fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Female BALB/c mice were immunized with beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I in a carbohydrate adjuvant or with carbohydrate adjuvant alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice were mated with BALB/c males and killed on day 11 to 13 of pregnancy, and the fetal status was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment blood samples were obtained for measurement of anticardiolipin and anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anticardiolipin and anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice immunized with beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 17 of 145 gestational sacs (12%) in 18 mice immunized with beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I compared with 24 of 177 (14%) sacs in 21 control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no morphometric or histologic differences between gestational tissues, and platelet counts were similar for each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The induction of high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies in BALB/c mice by beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I immunizations did not result in fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These nonpathogenic beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I-induced anticardiolipin antibodies should prove useful in the characterization of clinically relevant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
