<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differences in the pathogenesis of APS as compared to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> might be connected with different serum levels of both mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To answer this question, we studied 147 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 21 with SLE-like syndrome (SLE-LS), 20 with isolated APS (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, PAPS), and 32 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients from the SLE group fulfilled the updated APS criteria (secondary APS, SAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In comparison to healthy subjects, TNF-α concentration was increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, while sIL-2R rose significantly in the SLE group only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APS (both SAPS and PAPS) was characterized by the highest levels of TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or elevated levels of IgG anticardiolipin or IgG anti-β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies had higher TNF-α levels than patients without the presence of any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the presence of aPL is associated with higher TNF-α level, whereas increased level of sIL-2R is rather connected with definite SLE where inflammatory processes prevail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It might be hypothesized that TNF-α plays a major role in pathogenesis of APS thrombotic phenomena </plain></SENT>
