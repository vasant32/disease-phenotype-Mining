<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our recent 10 years statistical survey at Keio University indicates that 1,877 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> are recorded in total 9,200 pregnancies, thus showing approximately 16.95 per cent wastages in known conceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, possible statistics on reproductive wastages are collected and summarized, then comprehensive examinations on the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortion</z:e> were performed on our registered patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Appropriate therapy was selected and its clinical result was also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred and thirty eight couples were registered as repeatedly or habitually aborted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these, 124 women repeatedly aborted due to congenital uterine anomaly, mainly bicornuate or arcuate uterus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new method to evaluate uterine deformities related to abortion rate was introduced, while basic research was also performed to elucidate exact mechanism of abortion in these uteri by analysing distribution of arteries in both abnormal and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that numbers of uterine arteries were significantly reduced in congenital abnormal uterus as compared to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An ideal metroplasty was introduced from the research results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty four children were born after 27 metroplasties, while no full term baby was delivered in 96 pregnancies before surgical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty four women were suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">habitual abortions</z:e> due to chromosomal abnormalities among 639 couples examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis indicates that most frequent abnormalities were translocations, inversions as well as other variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extremely high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> were observed in each type of abnormality, suggesting ample time should be payed for genetic consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Luteal insufficiency and other diseases including anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome were detected, however other 351 cases showed no significant abnormality except HLA compatible among the couples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
