<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that endothelial cell (EC) activation and tissue factor (TF) upregulation in EC and monocytes by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL Abs) leads to a prothrombotic state and involves translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the effects of an NF-kappaB inhibitor on aPL-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, TF activity, and EC in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We treated CD1 mice with IgG from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS) or with control IgG (IgG-NHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes (number of white blood cells) to EC in cremaster muscle (as an indication of EC activation) as well as the size of an induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the femoral vein of the mice were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some mice in each group were infused with 10 microM MG132 (an inhibitor of NF-kappaB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TF activity was determined using a chromogenic assay in homogenates of carotid arteries and in peritoneal cells of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo, IgG-APS increased significantly the number of white blood cells adhering to ECs (4.7 +/- 2.2) when compared to control mice (1.5 +/- 0.8), and these effects were significantly reduced when mice were pretreated with MG132 (0.8 +/- 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG-APS increased significantly the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size and MG132 inhibited that effect (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the mice with IgG-APS also induced significantly increased TF function in peritoneal cells and in homogenates of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the mice with MG132 abrogated those effects significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice injected with IgG-APS or with IgM-APS with or without the inhibitor had medium-high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies in serum at the time of the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data show that prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties of IgG-APS and IgM-APS are downregulated in vivo by an NF-kappaB inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may be important in designing new modalities of targeted therapies to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
