<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their prevalence and relative contribution to thromboembolic risk in LA-positive patients is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine their presence and association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in a large series of patients with confirmed LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma from LA-positive patients was collected at <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> Centers and sent to a reference central laboratory for confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positive plasma was tested using home-made ELISA for the presence of aPT and anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LA was confirmed in 231 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one of 231 (26%, 95%CI 22-33) LA positive subjects were positive for IgG aPT and 62 (27%, 95% CI 21-33) were positive for IgM aPT antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> (APS) were not associated with the presence of IgG aPT [43 APS in 61 (70%) positive and 109 APS in 170 (64%) negative IgG aPT subjects, p=ns] or IgM aPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rate of positivity of IgG and IgM a beta(2)GPI was significantly higher than that of IgG and IgM aPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical events accounting for APS occurred in 97 of 130 (75%) IgG a beta(2)GPI positive and in 55 of 101 (54%) IgG a beta(2)GPI negative patients (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.3, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant association with clinical events in patients positive for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI as compared to those positive for one or another test was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When patients negative for both IgG aPT and IgG a beta(2)GPI (LA positive only) were compared with remaining patients, a significantly lower association with clinical events was found (OR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.7, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As compared to IgG a beta(2)GPI, the prevalence of IgG aPT in patients with LA is significantly lower and not associated with the clinical features of APS </plain></SENT>
