<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: aCL were measured in 116 healthy controls and 372 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> of different stage and etiology: 136 cases secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 139 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, 69 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1442981" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver damage</z:e>, and 28 cryptogenic in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior thrombotic events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were related to age, gender, stage, severity, and etiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, as well as to the occurrence of organ- and nonorgan-specific autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aCL were positive in 4.4% of controls and in 18.8% of patients (p &lt; 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with aCL were more frequently men with an advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and simultaneous occurrence of anti-smooth-muscle antibodies (ASMA) in serum (p &lt; 0.0006); their liver damage was often secondary to HBV (37.3%) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e> (18.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At conditional logistic regression analysis, only the presence of ASMA (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-5.5, p = 0.0003), HBV (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.2, p = 0.0013), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023896" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alcoholic liver disease</z:e> (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 2.3-12.2, p = 0.0001) were independently associated with aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> was encountered in 24 patients (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At conditional logistic regression analysis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was significantly associated with advanced age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.0-1.1, p = 0.0094), development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (OR = 17.8, 95% CI 1.6-196.0, p = 0.01), HBV etiology (OR = 6.3, 95% CI, 1.6-24.6, p = 0.0076), or cryptogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> (OR = 54.8, 95% CI 5-599.9, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the five patients with newly documented portal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during the follow-up, only one tested positive for aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonautoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, aCL production is an epiphenomenon of the liver damage and is not associated with thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data do not support the hypothesis that HCV is a cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
