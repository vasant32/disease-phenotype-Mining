<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to establish the prevalence of CD antibodies in a cohort of APS patients, and to examine whether CD may be responsible for some of the manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients (47 females, 10 males) with APS were studied for clinical manifestations and serological markers of the disease, as well as the presence of anti-endomysial antibodies using an ELISA assay (EMA-ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control subjects were 171 healthy individuals, age- and sex-matched (141 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with APS (14%, six females) were found to have EMA-ELISA antibodies, compared with 2/141 (1.1%) of controls (P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (beta2GPI) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> (GRTCPKPDDLP) were more prevalent in EMA-positive patients than in EMA-negative patients (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasculitic <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were significantly more common in EMA-ELISA-positive compared with EMA-ELISA-negative patients(62.5 versus 16.3%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the skin manifestations, superficial cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (37.5 versus 2%, P = 0.007) was more prevalent in EMA-ELISA-positive than in EMA-ELISA-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EMA-ELISA antibodies are common in APS, and their presence is associated with high prevalence of antibodies recognizing certain beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, and with cutaneous manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
