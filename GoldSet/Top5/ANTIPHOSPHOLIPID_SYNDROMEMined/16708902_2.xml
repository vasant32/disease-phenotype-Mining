<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: General adult intensive care unit of an institutional tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients in the intensive care unit during a consecutive 8-month period were examined for adverse cutaneous drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients in the intensive care unit have an incidence of 11.6% of adverse cutaneous drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associated risk factors were female gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, age over 60 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, dysthyroidism, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few patients had previous history of adverse cutaneous drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antimicrobials were the main drug involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morbilliform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> followed by urticary were the most frequently observed reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, over 50% of patients with massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> -independent of etiology- died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care unit patients are particularly at risk for developing an adverse cutaneous drug reaction </plain></SENT>
