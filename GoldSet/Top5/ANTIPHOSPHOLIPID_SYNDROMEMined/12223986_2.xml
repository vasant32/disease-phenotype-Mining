<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI levels were measured in 51 SLE patients, 20 patients with SLE and APS (secondary APS) and 11 primary APS patients using commercially available ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relationships between laboratory data and clinical manifestations of the patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IgG ACL positivity was significantly higher in primary (36.4%) and secondary (40%) APS than in SLE (13.7%) patients (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of IgG anti-beta2GPI positivity was significantly higher in primary (54.5%) and secondary (35%) APS than in SLE (7.8%) patients (P = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean levels of IgG ACL and anti-beta2GPI were significantly higher in the primary and secondary APS than in the SLE patients (P = 0.002 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI (P = 0.01, R(2) = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the presence of IgG ACL and a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the combined primary and secondary APS group, but not in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this study IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI are closely related and mean levels of IgG ACL and IgG anti-beta2GPI are higher in patients with either primary or secondary APS than in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
