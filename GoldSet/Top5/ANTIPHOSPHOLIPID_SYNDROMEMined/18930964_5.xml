<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PAPS (n = 41) patients were compared with patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (IT, n = 44) and controls (CTR, n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL, IgG anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)GPI), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), CRP bound to oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>-beta(2)GPI complex (CRP-oxLDL-beta(2)GPI) (as inflammatory markers) neopterin (NPT), soluble CD14 (sCD14) (as immune activation markers) were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After correction for confounders, PAPS showed higher plasma levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.0004), SAA (P &lt; 0.01), CRP-oxLDL-beta(2)GPI (P = 0.0004), NPT (P &lt; 0.0001) and sCD14 (P = 0.007) than IT and CTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two regression models were applied to the PAPS group: in the first, IgG aCL and IgG beta(2)GPI were included amongst the independent variables and in the second they were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first model, SAA (as the dependent variable) independently related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> number (P = 0.003); NPT (as the dependent variable) independently related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> type (arterial, P = 0.03) and number (P = 0.04); sCD14 (as the dependent variable) independently related to IgG beta(2)GPI (P = 0.0001), age (0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P = 0.01); CRP-oxLDL-beta(2)GPI (as the dependent variable) independently related to IgG beta(2)GPI (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second model, sCD14 and NPT independently related to each other (P = 0.002) (this was noted also in the IT group, P &lt; 0.0001) and CRP-oxLDL-beta(2)GPI independently predicted SAA (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and immune activation occur in thrombotic PAPS and relate to clinical features and aPL levels </plain></SENT>
