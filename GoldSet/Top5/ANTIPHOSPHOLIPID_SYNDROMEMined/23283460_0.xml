<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies that recognise these arrangements have been described in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>; these antibodies have also been documented in an experimental murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, in which they are associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate the presence of antibodies against non-bilayer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> arrangements containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25438">mycolic acids</z:chebi> in the sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lepromatous leprosy</z:e> (LL) patients, but not those of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of antibodies that recognise these non-bilayer <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> arrangements may contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010702'>hypergammaglobulinaemia</z:hpo> observed in LL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found IgM and IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies in 77% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This positive correlation between the anti-mycolic-non-bilayer arrangements and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies suggests that both types of antibodies are produced by a common mechanism, as was demonstrated in the experimental murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, in which there was a correlation between the anti-non-bilayer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> arrangements and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to non-bilayer <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> arrangements may represent a previously unrecognised pathogenic mechanism in LL and the detection of these antibodies may be a tool for the early diagnosis of LL patients </plain></SENT>
