<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) was the most common cause of secondary APS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those with definite APS, there were similar proportions with arterial and venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent thromboses occurred in 14 (23.7%) patient with definite APS receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, comprising 14 (73.7%) episodes of arterial and 5 (26.3%) episodes of venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent arterial thromboses occurred at international normalized ratio (INR) of &lt;2 in 5 (35.7%), INR 2-3 in 6 (42.9%), INR &gt; 3 in 3 (21.4%) episodes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent venous thromboses occurred at INR &lt; 2 in 4 (80.0%) and INR &gt; 3 in 1 (20.0%) episode, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Target INR &gt; 3 was associated with lower rates of recurrent arterial thromboses but higher rates of major and recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Target INR &gt;/= 2 appeared to be sufficient to prevent recurrent venous thromboses </plain></SENT>
