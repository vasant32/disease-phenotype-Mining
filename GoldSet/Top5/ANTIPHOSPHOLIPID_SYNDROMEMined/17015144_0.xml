<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APL) and identify disease-associated antigens in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the monoclonal antibody <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B, derived from a patient with APS suffering from multiple ischemic events, to screen a 12-mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> phage display library (New England Biolabs, London, England) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identified phage clones were sequenced and the derived consensus <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was synthesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was used to perform competitive inhibition experiments for their ability to inhibit the binding of the monoclonal antibody and of serum antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally patients and control sera were screened for their binding reactivities to this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this 12-mer phage display library the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> APHKHKASLSIY as consensus <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> for the monoclonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In competitive inhibition studies we showed that this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is able to inhibit the binding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-5B to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine and furthermore another <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> used as control was also inhibited in its binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using 21 sera from APS patients 67% showed a binding to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in a specific ELISA above the cutoff level, generated with sera from 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of the reactive patients' sera we used two exemplarily to perform inhibition studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both sera could be inhibited more than 40% in their binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in a commercially available <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> assay (Aescu.diagnostics, Wendelsheim, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> APHKHKASLSIY simulates the antigenic structure recognized from a subpopulation of serum <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This might indicate that the diversity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is limited and only few <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> or few common structures are responsible for the development of those antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Tests using these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> will strongly improve laboratory diagnosis of the APS </plain></SENT>
