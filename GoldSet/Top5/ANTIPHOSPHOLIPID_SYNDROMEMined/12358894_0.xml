<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, association has been demonstrated between APS and HLA-DR 4, HLA-DR 7 and HLA-DRB1 14 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we have described a family sharing the common haplotype of HLA-DR 7 where definite or probable anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome has been identified in six of the seven family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from the index case, the other family members have demonstrated partial association in spite of sharing the incriminated haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This could be ascribed either to variable penetrance of the involved genes or to the role of an unaccounted for environmental factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it is possible that the coexistence of the HLA haplotype and the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies is coincidental </plain></SENT>
