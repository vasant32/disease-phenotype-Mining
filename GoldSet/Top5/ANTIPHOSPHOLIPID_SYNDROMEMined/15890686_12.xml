<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta(2)-GPI) is a major antigen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> present in patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether anti-beta(2)-GPI monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could inhibit APC with similar membrane specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five mouse mAbs that reacted with different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on beta(2)-GPI were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each inhibited the PE-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> oxidation-dependent enhancement of APC <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity and required antibody divalency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A chimeric APC that retains <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity but is relatively unaffected by protein S, PE, or oxidation was not inhibited by the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In purified systems, anti-beta(2)-GPI mAb inhibition of factor Va inactivation was greater in the presence of protein S and required beta(2)-GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, although the mAbs did increase beta(2)-GPI affinity for membranes, PE and oxidation had little influence on the affinity of the beta(2)-GPI antibody complex for the membrane vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that antibodies to beta(2)-GPI inhibit APC function specifically and contribute to a hypercoaguable state by disrupting specific protein-protein interactions induced by oxidation of PE-containing membranes </plain></SENT>
