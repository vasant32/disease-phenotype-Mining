<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activated protein C (APC) resistance phenotype associated with an abnormal factor V Leiden (FVL), and the G20210A prothrombin gene mutation are the most common findings in patients with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a group of 210 patients, we compared the levels of markers of coagulation activation in carriers of FVL (71 heterozygous, 30 homozygous), G20210A prothrombin mutation (88 heterozygous) or both mutations combined (21 heterozygous), in order to assess whether these markers allow identification of a group of patients with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; they were also compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 143 patients had a personal history of VTE and 67 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of them had other hereditary causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None were currently treated with either <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or hormonal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pregnant women were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference between the four groups of patients could be found in the levels of F1+2, TAT and DDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher than the control values (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of F1+2 and TAT were similar in patients with or without a history of VTE, regardless of the type of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DDI levels were significantly higher in patients with a history of VTE than in asymptomatic subjects (443+/-248 vs. 333+/-222 ng/ml, p=0.02) but with only 57% sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study confirms the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> found in mutation carriers and points out the inability of F1+2 and TAT assays to identify a group of subjects at higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, within carriers of genetic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the sensitivity and specificity of DDI assay are low, high DDI concentrations tend to be associated with the risk of VTE </plain></SENT>
