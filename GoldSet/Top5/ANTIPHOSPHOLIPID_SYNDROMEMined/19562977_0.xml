<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper describes the case of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> 55-years-old man in whom no muscular-skeletal system symptoms were found during the period of 2 years before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and who was treated because of cardiac involvement (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo>, PAF), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleuritis</z:hpo>, malaise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only the occurrence of non erosive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> decided on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> as a cause of his complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously the diagnostics was based on the exclusion of malignant diseases and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The determination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> in high titer without any specific, typical of individual disease entities <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> allowed only the diagnose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409999" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">undifferentiated connective tissue disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glucocorticosteroid treatment was initiated, however six months later despite treatment with metyloprednisolone the symptoms and signs associated with PM accompanied by high level of creatinophosphokinase and elevated transaminase were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The muscle biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo>, but no specific antibodies, especially anti-Jo-1, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is very interesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> pulse therapy failed to prevent the development of antiphospholipide syndrome and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> in the PM patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overlapping of immunological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tissue disorders</z:e> is a well-known phenomenon, but in the case of fulminating and distinct symptoms and signs the lack of detection of specific antibodies is quite uncommon </plain></SENT>
