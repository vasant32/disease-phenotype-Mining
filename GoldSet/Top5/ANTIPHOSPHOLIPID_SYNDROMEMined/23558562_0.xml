<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The majority of cases of unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> (RSA) remains unclear and is found to be associated with alloimmune antibodies termed as mixed lymphocyte reaction blocking factor (MLR-Bf) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The decreased production of MLR-Bf may play major role in the immunologic failure of pregnancy and can lead to abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at evaluating MLR-Bf as potential biomarker of indication and the efficacy of immunotherapy with paternal lymphocytes (LIT) in women with RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 97 women with history of unexplained RSA were recruited for this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These women showed negative for MLR-Bf and registered for lymphocyte immunotherapy with husband cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with autoimmune pathology or anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals gave their consent to participate in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have analyzed MLR proliferative response and MLR-Bf in nonpregnant women with history of RSA before and after LIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following LIT, the initially low MLR proliferative response was restored at 76.6 % of women, and MLR-Bf activity in blood serum could be detected in 74 % of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of successful pregnancy was shown to be significantly higher in women positive for MLR-Bf (50/72) as compared with the MLR-Bf negative women (7/25; χ (2) = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The data obtained demonstrate that LIT with the paternal lymphocytes in MLR-Bf negative women is accompanied by increased proliferative cell response to the paternal alloantigens and by enhanced production of soluble suppressor activity factors (MLR-Bf) that is associated with improved pregnancy outcome in women with history of RSA </plain></SENT>
