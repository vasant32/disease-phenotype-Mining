<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, anticardiolipin (aCL) and other autoantibodies were studied in 38 first and 2nd degree family members of 3 index cases selected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and 33 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C4 protein phenotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of C4 and MHC class II loci were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen family members (46%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> or autoantibodies; aCL were present in 10 family members, 4 of whom had primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each family had 2 or more subjects with aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 22 independent haplotypes in family members, there was a high frequency of C4A and C4B deficiency alleles (0.41 vs 0.18 in 66 controls, p = 0.03) and a strong trend toward an increase in MHC DQB1 putative risk factors that share the TRAELDT structural domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This DQB1 structural domain was present in 4/5 different haplotypes that contained a C4B deficiency genotype; however, neither of 2 different haplotypes with a C4A deletion (one being a common ancestral haplotype) contained this DQB1 putative risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 family members who had aCL, 10/20 haplotypes contained a C4 deficiency genotype; moreover, the DQB1 putative risk factor was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 MHC haplotypes that did not contain a C4A deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these families, expression of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> trait as aCL antibody appears to be associated with the coexistence of C4 deficiency alleles with DQB1 alleles that contain the TRAELDT structural domain </plain></SENT>
