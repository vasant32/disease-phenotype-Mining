<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASES: A complete ophthalmological examination was conducted on 2 patients who presented with blurred or distorted vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography was used to examine the integrity of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> circulatory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory blood studies were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: In both patients, some of the major <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterioles appeared white and had a thread-like appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography demonstrated progressive occlusion or stenosis of these major arterioles with extensive insufficiency of the regional capillary bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and was treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization occurred during a 3-year follow-up in one of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APS should be considered in cases of white thread-like <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arterioles in APS may be progressive and responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> of the retina </plain></SENT>
