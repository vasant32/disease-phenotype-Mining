<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the pathogenic potential of aPL by intracerebro-ventricular (ICV) administration of immunoglobulins (IgG) from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG, purified from the sera of four APS patients, was tested for binding to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse brain by immunohistological staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These IgG (7.5 microg) were injected ICV unilaterally to male C3H mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice injected with IgG purified from pooled sera derived from healthy subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mice were examined neurologically for motor function and coordination, and cognitively in a <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cognitive tests were performed with the experimenter blinded to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The performance of the mice in four separate experiments was compared by analysis of variance with repeated measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG from one APS patient was found to bind best to neuronal structures in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mice (n = 43) injected with this IgG performed worse in the water maze compared to the controls (n = 45) with significant effects of the aPL IgG on the overall performance of the mice (treatment, P &lt; 0.03), on learning throughout the experiment (treatment x day, P &lt; 0.02) and on short term memory (treatment x day xtrial, P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IgG injected from two of the three other patients also bound specifically to mouse brain neurons and produced an impairment in performance of the water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that aPL that gain access to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system may play a direct role in the pathogenesis of neurological manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
