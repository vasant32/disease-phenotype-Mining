<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in individuals who have a thrombotic event is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the general population is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In RATIO (Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial Thrombosis</z:hpo> In relation to Oral contraceptives), a large multicentre population-based case-control study, we enrolled women aged under 50 years who were admitted to hospital at 16 centres with first ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> between January, 1990, and October, 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional 59 women who presented with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the University Medical Centre Utrecht between 1996 and 2001 were also enrolled </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the second phase (1998-2002), blood samples were taken to measure <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> profiles (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin IgG, anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I IgG, and antiprothrombin IgG) and to determine genetic prothrombotic risk factors (factor V G1691A variant, prothrombin G20210A variant, and factor XIII 204Phe allele) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 175 patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 203 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and 628 healthy controls were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was 5.3 (95% CI 1.4-20.8), which increased to 21.6 (1.9-242.0) in women who used oral contraceptives and 33.7 (6.0-189.0) in those who smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 43.1 (12.2-152.0), which increased to 201.0 (22.1-1828.0) in women who used oral contraceptives and 87.0 (14.5-523.0) in those who smoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In women who had anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies, the risk of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), but the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was not increased (0.9, 0.5-1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither anticardiolipin nor antiprothrombin antibodies affected the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
