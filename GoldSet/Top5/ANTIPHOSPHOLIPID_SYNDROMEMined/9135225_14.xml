<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group of 171 APS patients seen in our department were studied for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and serological features of these patients were analysed by standard methods and each of them was correlated to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and compared with those found in the group without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each of the patients studied had a minimum of three platelet counts during the follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty (23.4%) were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; 13 with persistently low and 27 patients with intermittently <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, disease duration or diagnosis when compared with the group of APS patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 18, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> in five, and with both of these features in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was the only manifestation of the APS in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had persistently positive tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> concomitantly with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and clinical or serological manifestations in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed a prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of 23.4% in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients did not present any significant clinical or serological features that distinguish them from those patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
