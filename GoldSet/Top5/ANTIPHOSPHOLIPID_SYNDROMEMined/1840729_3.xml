<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine women with unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> (RSA), previously assayed for the presence of ACL by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay, were typed for HLA-DR and DQ antigens by the classical microlymphocytotoxicity test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five women were positive for ACL and 24 were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR7 was found in 24.5% of 49 habitually aborting women vs. 28% of healthy controls; but the DR7 frequency was 40% in ACL positive patients vs. 8.3% in ACL negative patients (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results show that in the Italian population an association between HLA-DR7 antigen and ACL is present in women with unexplained RSA, suggesting that HLA-DR genes might control the susceptibility to specific autoantibody production </plain></SENT>
