<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the last decade, a wide variety of clinical manifestations and serological disturbances have been described associated to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However the real prevalence of most clinical manifestations with several autoantibody-cofactor systems still needs precise epidemiological and clinical long-term study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of frequency clinical and serological symptoms of SLE and APS in PAPS and SAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of pts were analyzed: 78 SAPS (76F+2M) and 43 PAPS (32F+11M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pts met Sapporo criteria for APS and SAPS pts met ARA criteria for SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological, clinical and serological data were collected during 1995-2005 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Connective Tissue Disease</z:e>, Institute of Rheumatology, Warsaw, Poland and modified in 2005 according to actual directive line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PAPS pts were younger at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease compare to SAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration time of the disease to set up the diagnosis as well as observation time was shorter in PAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Separated PAPS pts showed no more than two ARA criteria for SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical ARA criteria for SLE occurred more often in SAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and anti AnnexinV abs occurred more often in these pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and IgM aCL, LAC, anti beta2GP1, oxyLDL abs occurred more often in PAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>Arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, crural ulceration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, false positive VDRL and IgG aCL abs were detected in almost the same percentage in both groups of pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Men are less affected with SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Wide variety of clinical SLE symptoms and immunological disturbances are more frequent in SAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Also in these pts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and anti AnnexinV abs occur more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with LAC, anti beta2GP1, IgM aCl, anti oxyLDL occur in less frequency in SAPS pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, crural ulceration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, false positive VDRL and aCL IgG were almost in the same percentage in both groups of pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Precise determination of the link between clinical symptoms of the APS and antibody-cofactor system needs future study on a bigger sample of pts </plain></SENT>
