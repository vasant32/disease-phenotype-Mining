<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to develop evidence-based recommendations addressing the major issues in the management of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The EULAR Task Force on SLE comprised 19 specialists and a clinical epidemiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key questions for the management of SLE were compiled using the Delphi technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systematic search of PubMed and Cochrane Library Reports was performed using McMaster/Hedges clinical queries' strategies for questions related to the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For neuropsychiatric, pregnancy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> questions, the search was conducted using an array of relevant terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence was categorised based on sample size and type of design, and the categories of available evidence were identified for each recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strength of recommendation was assessed based on the category of available evidence, and agreement on the statements was measured across the 19 specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve questions were generated regarding the prognosis, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of SLE, including neuropsychiatric SLE, pregnancy, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evidence to support each proposition was evaluated and scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After discussion and votes, the final recommendations were presented using brief statements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average agreement among experts was 8.8 out of 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recommendations for the management of SLE were developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert consensus with high level of agreement among the experts </plain></SENT>
