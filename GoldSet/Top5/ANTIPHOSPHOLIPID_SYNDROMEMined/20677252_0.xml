<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI in 15 active NPSLE, 26 inactive NPSLE patients, and 11 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) maps were reconstructed and regions of interest were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of SLE criteria, NPSLE syndromes, immunological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorder</z:e>, and medication on CBF, CBV, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the groups in CBF, CBV, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant influence of SLE criteria or NPSLE syndromes on CBF, CBV, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant influence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant, the presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), or medication on CBF, CBV, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest CBF, CBV, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in the white and the gray matter in SLE patients is not significantly different from healthy controls or between patients with and without specific symptoms or with and without immunological disorder involving coagulation </plain></SENT>
