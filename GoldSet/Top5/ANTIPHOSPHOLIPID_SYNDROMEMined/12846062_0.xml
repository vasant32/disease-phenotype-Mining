<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A human lymphoproliferative syndrome characterized by a defect of the Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway in the absence of a fas gene mutation (Autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lymphoproliferative Disease</z:e>) has recently been described and characterized by autoimmune phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antinuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and to define their specificity in 5 pediatric patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>Antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> were investigated by Western Blot and IIF performed under standard as well as apoptotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fine specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> was dissected by an ELISA for anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, anti-prothrombin, anti-annexin V and anti-protein S antibodies, and by immunostaining on thin layer chromatography plates for antiphospholipid molecule antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study showed that the autoantibodies found in these patients targeted a broad spectrum of nuclear antigens which undergo redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane during the course of the apoptotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reactivity does not comprise known specificities such as anti-extractable nuclear antigens or anti-dsDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were also found in these sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further characterization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> showed the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> response with antibodies directed to negatively-charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and antibodies targeting coagulation-related proteins (beta 2-GPI, prothrombin, annexin V) which are considered relevant antigens in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that lack of tolerance due to a defect of Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> allows the survival of B and T clones involved in the antinuclear and antiphospholipid immune responses </plain></SENT>
