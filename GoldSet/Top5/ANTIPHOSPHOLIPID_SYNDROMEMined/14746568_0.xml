<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> due to spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic pancarditis</z:e> created an inflammatory, thrombogenic environment that facilitated coronary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> secondary to APS, a novel association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient was left with significant left ventricular dysfunction at a young age, and cases such as this emphasize the need for early recognition and proper treatment of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS is incompletely understood, and the cellular and molecular basis for this, including the role of 'second hits', are areas needing further investigation </plain></SENT>
