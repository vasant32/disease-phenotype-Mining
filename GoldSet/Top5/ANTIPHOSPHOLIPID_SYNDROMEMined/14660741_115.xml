<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, therapy for pregnant women with APS is focused on preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but anticoagulation is only partially successful in averting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that complement activation is a central mechanism of pregnancy loss in APS and tested this in a model in which pregnant mice receive human IgG containing aPL Ab's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we identify complement component C5 (and particularly its cleavage product C5a) and neutrophils as key mediators of fetal injury, and we show that Ab's or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that block C5a-C5a receptor interactions prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fact that F(ab)'2 fragments of aPL Ab's do not mediate fetal injury and that C4-deficient mice are protected from fetal injury suggests that activation of the complement cascade is initiated via the classical pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies in factor B-deficient mice, however, indicate that alternative pathway activation is required and amplifies complement activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, activating Fc gamma Rs do not play an important role in mediating aPL Ab-induced fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings identify the key innate immune effectors engaged by pathogenic autoantibodies that mediate poor pregnancy outcomes in APS and provide novel and important targets for prevention of pregnancy loss in APS </plain></SENT>
