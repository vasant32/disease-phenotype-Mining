<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), initially diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, resulting in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR">mitral valve incompetence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case raises questions of the specificity of the Jones diagnostic criteria for rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in a population where it is infrequently encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are similarities in clinical, pathological and echocardiographic presentations between rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and APS, in addition to common immunological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our case highlights the possibility that rather than rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> being primarily responsible for her recurrent attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infections</z:e> in our patient occurred either in the setting of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> ('second hit' phenomenon), or may have triggered the development of pathogenic antibodies (molecular mimicry), subsequently leading to the clinical evolution of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the three decades of our patient and her recurrent problems, there has been an evolving knowledge of the mechanisms of APS and rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, allowing us to extend our understanding beyond symptoms and syndromes, to a better realization of the underlying immunological relationship between the two </plain></SENT>
