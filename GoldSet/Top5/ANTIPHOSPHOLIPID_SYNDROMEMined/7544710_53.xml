<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, anti-endothelial and anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies were studied for their binding activity on endothelial monolayers cultured in the presence or absence of media containing bovine serum as a source of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-endothelial activity was also evaluated on endothelial cells cultured without serum and supplemented with exogenous human purified beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies were investigated under the same experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effect of the incubation of these affinity purified fractions on the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ELAM-1) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The reactivity of the sera decreased on endothelial cells incubated in serum-free medium, while endothelial cell binding was restored in a dose dependent manner after the addition of exogenous purified human beta 2 GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Affinity purified anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies obtained from the same sera retained their endothelial cell binding and were able to activate endothelial cells by inducing the ex novo surface expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ELAM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the close association between anti-endothelial and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies is sustained by antibodies which recognize beta 2 GPI adhering to the endothelial cells, and can promote their activation </plain></SENT>
