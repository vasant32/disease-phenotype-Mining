<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the prevalences and the clinical associations of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2GPI (abeta2GPI) antibodies in a large series of European patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 574 SLE patients from 7 European countries were tested for aCL and abeta2GPI by ELISA methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aCL of IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes were detected in 22.8%, 14%, and 13.9% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM abeta2GPI were detected in 20% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of aCL was highly associated with the presence of abeta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medium-high titer IgG aCL and abeta2GPI were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with similar sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When present at medium-high titer, IgG aCL were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, IgM aCL with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: aCL, when present at medium-high titer, are as important as abeta2GPI, as a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Medium-high titer aCL, but not abeta2GPI, are associated with other clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
