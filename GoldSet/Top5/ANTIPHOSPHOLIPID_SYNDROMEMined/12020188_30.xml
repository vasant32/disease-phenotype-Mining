<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is still debate about the optimum intensity of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 66 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (Sapporo criteria) and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were receiving oral anticoagulation to a target international normalized ratio of 3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every patient was individually interviewed to recall major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and thrombotic episodes during the previous 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were mainly women and white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was 6 cases per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-15.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of intracranial bleed was 1.5 per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 0.04-8.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of thrombotic recurrences was 9.1 cases per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 3.3-19.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most recurrences took place in the same vascular bed as the original <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age, time receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, primary vs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, positivity for anticardiolipin antibodies, positivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were not predictive of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of thrombotic recurrences was independently higher in patients who were receiving anticoagulation for longer periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of intracranial and fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in patients with definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated with oral anticoagulation to a target international normalized ratio of 3.5 is similar than in groups of patients treated to lower target ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk of thrombotic recurrences, even during anticoagulation, was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most recurrences took place in the same territory as original thromboses </plain></SENT>
