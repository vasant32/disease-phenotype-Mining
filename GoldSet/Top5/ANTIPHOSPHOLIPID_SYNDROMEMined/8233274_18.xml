<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, who had experienced 56 fetal losses in 63 previous pregnancies (88.9%), were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (40 mg/day) and aspirin (100 mg/day) during 28 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler ultrasound was performed at 18-24 weeks' gestation to investigate the resistance index of the uterine arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treated women delivered 23 live infants in the 28 pregnancies (82.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three infants weighed less than the tenth percentile (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five pregnancies were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> and ten by nonproteinuric gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> anti-coagulant, VDRL) at conception identified pregnancies destined to have poor fetal outcome and a significantly lower birth weight compared to pregnancies not having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three assays positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An abnormal resistance index of the uterine arteries predicted pregnancies with poor fetal outcome in terms of week of delivery, birth weight, and birth percentile, as well as four of five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three assays positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> at conception and an abnormal resistance index of the uterine arteries at 18-24 weeks' gestation predicted pregnancies at major risk for obstetric complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should determine whether treatment can be modulated based on the Doppler findings </plain></SENT>
