<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the protein C activity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and the presence of several types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in 60 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (31.6%) and 5 controls (8.3%) had decreased protein C activity (95% CI, 10%-37%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leiden mutation was found in 5 controls (8.3%) and in 4 patients (8.3%; 95% CI, 8-24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a strong association between decreased protein C activity and presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and antibodies against b2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased protein C activity depended on the antibody titre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although abnormalities of the natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> proteins like protein C and protein S seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of the APS, activation of protein C also occurs during the process of clotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies such as we describe may help us identify subsets of patients whose clotting is dependent on protein C-antiphospholipid interactions that may lead to future novel therapies </plain></SENT>
