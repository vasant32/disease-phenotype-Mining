<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an earlier study of a cohort of 667 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) followed for 7.5 months with mean antiphospholipid (aPL) testing 2.5 times, we found a 10% prevalence of definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (2 clinical manifestations and high aPL levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if more followup and aPL testing increased such prevalence we restudied the cohort after a mean followup of 3.1 years and a mean aPL testing of 5.6 times and found a 15% prevalence of definite APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 21% of patients with SLE had probable APS with either high titers of aPL but only one clinical manifestation or low titers with 2 clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of high titer positivity of aPL (IgG and/or IgM isotype) reached 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One aPL related feature that increased significantly was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> possibly from increased awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors that influenced significantly the mobility upwards in APS category were more pregnancies and further aPL testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, immunosuppressive treatment decreased higher aPL levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The large number of patients with long disease duration in our cohort showed that the maximum prevalence of definite APS is reached after 15-18 years and is 23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This might be the highest prevalence of definite APS within SLE </plain></SENT>
