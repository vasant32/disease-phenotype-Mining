<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (PAPS) is an established cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, traditionally presumed to be due to 'intraplacental thromboses' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examines products of conception (POC) from early pregnancy failures to investigate the mechanism of pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: POC from patients attending a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> clinic and from terminations of pregnancy for non-medical reasons were examined histologically with particular regard to the presence or absence of vascular or intervillous thromboses and decidual endovascular trophoblast invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 31 PAPS-positive, 50 PAPS-negative, 34 aneuploid and 20 control cases at 6-14 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Villous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and frequency of intervillous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were not different among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> intradecidual endovascular trophoblast invasion was identified significantly less frequently in PAPS+ cases (24%), compared with controls (75%), aneuploid (53%), or PAPS- cases (61%; Z = -3.0, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases there was apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interstitial extravillous trophoblast invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Defective decidual endovascular trophoblast invasion, rather than excessive intervillous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, is the most frequent histological abnormality in PAPS+ associated early pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, endovascular trophoblast invasion is not significantly reduced in the majority of fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>-associated pregnancy failures </plain></SENT>
