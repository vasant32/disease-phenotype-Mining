<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the presence of anti-oxLDL antibodies and the presence of anti-beta2glycoprotein I (beta2gpI) antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the relationship between the appearance of anti-oxLDL antibodies and clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study included three groups of patients: 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 20 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of anti-oxLDL, anticardiolipin and anti-beta2gpI antibodies were detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was detected by coagulation tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the presence of anti-oxLDL antibodies was associated with a history of arterial thromboses in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (chi2 = 8.89, p &lt; 0.01) and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (chi2 = 4.64, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the appearance of anti-oxLDL antibodies was associated with the presence of anti-beta2gpI antibodies (chi2 = 4.25, p &lt; 0.05), which was not dependent on diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These preliminary observations have to be confirmed in a larger study </plain></SENT>
