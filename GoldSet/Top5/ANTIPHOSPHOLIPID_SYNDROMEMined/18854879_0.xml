<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: It was reported by several groups that patients diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) had developed a full-blown <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) even after many years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about clinical and/or serological factors that may help predict such evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antinucleosome antibodies (anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) were described to appear in early stages of SLE, in particular before anti-dsDNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in a large cohort of PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG and IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> antibodies were detected using a home made assay with H1-stripped chromatin as antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from 106 PAPS patients were tested; 52 of them were also tested during the follow-up, at least 2 years apart form the basal sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Medium-high titre anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> were found in nearly half of the patients (49/106, 46%), more frequently in those presenting features of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> like disease" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of patients displayed an unchanged pattern of anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We describe three cases of PAPS patients that developed SLE after many years of follow-up; high titre and low titre anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> were present in two and one of them respectively several years before evolving into SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of PAPS patients displayed medium-high titre anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, suggesting that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune response</z:mp> against chromatin may be a relevant event not only in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to explore the predictive value of anti-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> with respect to the evolution from PAPS to SLE </plain></SENT>
