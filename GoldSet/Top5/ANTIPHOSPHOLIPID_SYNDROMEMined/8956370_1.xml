<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoassays for IgG anti-beta 2 GPI have, however, suffered from a lack of standardization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe an assay based on reference standards that we developed recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay exhibits excellent linearity, with regard to both application of the standards and dilution of out-of-range specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Precision was assessed both within the between run and was judged to be satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reference interval was developed on the basis of a control group consisting of 111 men and 93 women, yielding a range of 0-19 standard IgG anti-beta 2 GPI units (SGU) for the ninety-fifth percentile of values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this standardized anti-beta 2 GPI assay may be useful in the clinical diagnostic laboratory </plain></SENT>
