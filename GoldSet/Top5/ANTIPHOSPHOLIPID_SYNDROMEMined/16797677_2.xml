<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I domain 13) activity was measured by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay in the plasma of healthy volunteers and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) patients to examine its usefulness in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of the ADAMTS13 activity did not show a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its median value was 107% (range: 55-170%) in healthy volunteers, but was significantly lower in patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (acquired or familial) and in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it was not significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ADAMTS13 activity by a FRET assay was closely correlated with that by the ADAMTS13 multimer method (r=0.816; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients with less than 10% of ADAMTS13 activity by FRET assay, less than 10% of that by multimer assay was 16, thus suggesting a good correlation for a low level of ADAMTS13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the ADAMTS13 FRET assay correlates well with the ADAMTS13 multimer method and it is therefore useful for making a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
