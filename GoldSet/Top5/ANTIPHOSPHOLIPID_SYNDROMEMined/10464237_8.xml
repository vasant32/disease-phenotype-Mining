<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While their presence in biological membranes has not been established, in vitro studies suggest that alterations in membrane properties modify their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, antiphospholipid monoclonal antibodies were developed against nonbilayer structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the monoclonal antibodies identifies nonplanar surfaces in liposomes and in membranes of cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are the first evidence that natural membranes maintain a fragile balance between bilayer and nonbilayer <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> arrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these antibodies can be used to evaluate the role of H(II)-preferring <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in the modulation of membrane activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrated that nonplanar surfaces are highly immunogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these structures are normally transient, their formation can be stabilized by temperature variations, drugs, antibiotics, apolar <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and divalent cations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies demonstrated that abnormal exposure of nonbilayer arrangements may induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp> as found in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
