<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Anticardiolipin antibodies belong to the group of antiphospholid antibodies, and may be seen in association with endothelial damage and recurrent vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> the frequency of anticardiolipin antibodies, and to correlate their presence with clinical activity and treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and 118 from age-matched controls were tested for IgG anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> group, we determined whether the patients had a past history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a clinically active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e>, or a current immunosuppressive therapy (steroids or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anticardiolipin antibodies were found significantly more often in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> than in controls: 11.0% versus 2.5%, P &lt; 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> had a past history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but none of them had anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies was not correlated with the fact that patients had a clinically active disease (P = 0.77), or a current immunosuppressive therapy at the time of the serological test (P = 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a significantly high prevalence of patients with anticardiolipin antibodies during <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positivity of the test does not seem to be correlated to the existence of a past history of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, nor to the clinical activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
