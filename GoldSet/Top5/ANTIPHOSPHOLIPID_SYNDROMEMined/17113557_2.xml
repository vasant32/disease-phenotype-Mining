<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of radial optic neurotomy (RON) for central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion (CRVO) in patients &lt; or =50 years of age (group 1) vs those &gt;50 (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, comparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 43 consecutive patients with CRVO and preoperative visual acuity (VA) &lt; or =0.70 logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy and RON at the nasal border of the optic disk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VA and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings were recorded preoperatively and at one, six, and 12 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Systemic hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and open-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were statistically significantly more prevalent in group 2 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient in group 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, and had another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients in group 1 gained &gt; or =3 lines of Early Treatment Diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> Study (ETDRS) vision, vs 33% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean final VA was 0.5 logMAR VA in group 1 vs 0.8 in group 2 (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Foveal thickness decreased significantly in both groups (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (55.6%) in group 1 and 13 (54.2%) in group 2 developed retinochoroidal collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> does not seem to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of CRVO in younger patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was present in only 11% of patients in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RON yielded better functional results in younger patients, although functional improvement remained limited in those with low baseline VA </plain></SENT>
