<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the placental histopathology findings in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> delivered preterm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing clinical outcomes and placental histopathology of 18 consecutive singleton pregnancies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (n = 9) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (n = 9) delivered between 24 and 37 weeks, and 54 controls matched for gestational age and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> (spontaneous or indicated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Placental examinations were performed by a single pathologist, and placental lesions were grouped into four categories: uteroplacental vascular pathology and related villous lesions; coagulation-related damage; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inflammatory lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis included the Mantel-Haenzsel or Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression, with a value of p &lt; 0.05 or an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) not inclusive of unity considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was positive in ten out of 18 cases and medium or high positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in seven out of 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antenatal treatment included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (n = 9), low-dose aspirin (n = 15) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> (33% vs. 0%, p &lt; 0.001) and of perinatal mortality (33% vs. 9%, p = 0.02) were significantly different between cases and controls, and rates of birth weight &lt; 10th centile approached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uteroplacental vascular lesions (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1, 11.7) and coagulation-related damage (OR 16.8, 95% CI 3.9, 72.6) were significantly more common among cases than controls, and rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory lesions approached significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> delivered preterm are associated with a significant increase in placental vascular and coagulation-related lesions, which are reflected clinically by higher rates of perinatal mortality, necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small-for-gestational age</z:hpo> neonates </plain></SENT>
