<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated their placental expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> villous tissues throughout gestation; first trimester n = 10, early second trimester; n = 4, preterm; n = 5) and term; n = 7 and in APS (2 first trimester, 1 preterm and 8 term deliveries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI and AV were both expressed by the placenta from as early as seven weeks gestation and were colocalised to the syncytiotrophoblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI staining was also observed in stromal cells, being present in phagocytic Hofbauer cells and surrounding newly formed fetal vessels in a perivascular pattern, from seven to seventeen weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An abnormal morphological distribution of AV was noted in one first trimester APS placenta, and for beta2GPI in a further first trimester placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When placental proteins were extracted from villous tissue, the concentration of AV/mg protein in term APS placentas (median, interquartile range) (aPS; 8.16, 7.879.72 microg/mg) was significantly higher (p &lt;0.005) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> term levels (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; 2.47, 2.28-2.54 microg/mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI increased with advancing gestation (first trimester; 0.93, 0.64-1.26 microg/mg, term; 3.67, 2.58-4.48 microg/mg) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Term APS placentas had a reduced beta2GPI content (2.31, 1.87-2.49 microg/mg), p &lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
