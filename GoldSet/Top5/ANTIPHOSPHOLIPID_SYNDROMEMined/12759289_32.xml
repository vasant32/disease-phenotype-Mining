<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of catastrophic APS is about 50%, but the long term outcome of patients who survive is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long term outcome of patients with catastrophic APS and provide further information on patients who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 130 patients with catastrophic APS have been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six new cases were recently added to this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these publications, the authors who reported patients who had survived were contacted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each author was asked (a) what treatment they gave their patients after the catastrophic APS; (b) if their patients had any further <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 63/136 (46%) patients died at the initial event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 73 patients, information was available for 58 (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty eight (66%) patients did not develop further APS related events during an average follow up of 67.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven (19%) patients developed further APS related events but were still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patients developed further catastrophic APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine (16%) patients died: due to multiple organ failure (three patients); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (one); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (one); and APS related events (four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sixty six per cent of patients who survive an initial catastrophic APS event remained symptom free with anticoagulation during an average follow up of 67.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty six per cent of the survivors developed further APS related events and the mortality rate of these patients was about 25% </plain></SENT>
