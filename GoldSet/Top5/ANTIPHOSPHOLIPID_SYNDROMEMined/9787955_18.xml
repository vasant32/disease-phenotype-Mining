<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have evaluated the impact of APAS on the renal transplant outcome of 174 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients' APAS status was determined by the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from each patient were tested for the presence of ACA by the ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplant outcomes were monitored for &gt; or = 1 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 174 patients, 78 received renal transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of these 78 patients had APAS as evidenced by either recurrent microrenal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (2 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (1 patient) or frequent A-V shunt <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (3 patients) along with high titers of ACA of IgM, IgG, or both subtypes at the time of their transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each of these 6 patients thrombosed their renal allografts within a week of their transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other 72 transplanted patients with no APAS were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doing well 1 yr post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between APAS and post-transplant <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> among these patients is highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no association was discerned between post-transplant <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and prior sensitization to HLA CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with APAS are at high risk for development of post-transplant <z:mp ids='MP_0011507'>renal thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
