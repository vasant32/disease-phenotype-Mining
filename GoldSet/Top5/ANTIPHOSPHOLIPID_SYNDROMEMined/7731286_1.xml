<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The a beta 2GPI antibodies were determined by enzymeimmunoassay in a group of 94 altruist blood donors and 135 patients (98 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 21 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, 10 cases with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon syndrome</z:e> and 6 with Q <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The a beta 2GPI antibodies were related with the aPl antibodies, fetal losses and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by a contingency table with Yates correction in the first two parameters and means comparison by the Students' t test for the history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The aPl and a beta 2GPI antibodies in the control group were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients the latter antibodies were positive in 33.6% (33 cases) of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, 57% (12 cases) of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, in one of the patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon syndrome</z:e> and in none of the patients with Q <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aPl antibodies were positive in 26.5% of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> and in 100% of the cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> or Q <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was found between the a beta 2GPI antibodies and thrombotic manifestations (p = 0.01) or obstetric complications (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A dependent relationship was observed in both autoantibodies (aPl and a beta 2GPI) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant relationship between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and the anti-beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies in addition to a relationship with thrombotic symptoms or obstetric complications </plain></SENT>
