<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</z:e> and 72 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors served as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients in the study group had aPLS associated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antineuronal antibodies were studied in the sera employing a novel flow cytometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of antineuronal antibodies in patients with aPLS and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement was not significantly different from that of patients with aPLS without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease or from that found in the control groups (12%, 19% and 7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it was significantly different from that found in SLE patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (60%) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further evidence that unlike <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-SLE, the major mechanism of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in patients with primary aPLS might not be autoantibody (antineuronal) mediated, but rather 'thrombotic' in origin, or due to yet unknown factors </plain></SENT>
