<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that among these antibodies, the so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LAs) augment beta2GPI binding to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> membrane surface, which is associated with the pathological action of LAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this augmentation are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that beta2GPI, which is monomeric in solution, self-interacts at the interface of soluble and surface-bound molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, this self-interaction is enhanced by LA-positive, but not LA-negative, anti-beta2GPI monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that beta2GPI self-interaction upon surface binding could be involved in the LA-induced potentiation of beta2GPI binding to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> surface </plain></SENT>
