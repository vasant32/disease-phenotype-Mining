<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The project of an international registry of paediatric patients with APS (the Ped-APS Registry) was initiated in 2004 to foster and conduct multicentre, controlled studies with large number of paediatric APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Ped-APS Registry is organised as a collaborative project of the European Forum on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibodies</z:hpo> and Juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</z:hpo> Working Group of the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently, it documents a standardised clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data of 133 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL)-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from 14 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The priority projects for future research of the Ped-APS Registry include prospective enrollment of new patients with aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, assessment of differences between the paediatric and adult APS, evaluation of proinflammatory genotype as a risk factor for APS manifestations in childhood and evaluation of patients with isolated nonthrombotic aPL-related manifestations </plain></SENT>
