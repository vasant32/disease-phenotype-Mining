<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, maternal as well as fetal sera were evaluated for the presence of anti-SSA (Ro), anti-SSB (La) and anti-70 kd RNP autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the sera from APLS patients, as well as in the sera from their offspring, the mean antibody titer of IgG aCL was found to be significantly higher then the corresponding value in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Highly significant increased titers of IgG anti-DNA antibodies were found in the sera of SLE mothers and their matched offspring (P &lt; 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anti-SSA, anti-SSA, and anti-70Kd RNP antibodies was lower then that of antiphospholipid and anti-dsDNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of the respective offspring had increased levels of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quantity of maternal antibodies transferred to the fetus was depended on their concentration in the maternal circulation, as well as on their type and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of newborn sera showed a progressive decrease in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> titers during 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 6 months it was undetected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results point to a transplacental transfer of aCL and anti-DNA antibodies, a phenomenon which is not necessarily associated with respective clinical manifestations, in contrast to the classical humoral mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis) </plain></SENT>
