<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed the pregnancy outcome of 221 pregnancies from 181 autoimmune patients, consecutively followed in a single Italian reference centre from 2001 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed with monthly visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy outcome was compared with the previous obstetrical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient population comprised five groups: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS, 39 pregnancies), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> (APS/RD, 17 pregnancies), other RD (92 pregnancies), isolated autoantibodies (autoAbs) in the absence of a definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> (aAbs, 38 pregnancies) and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">spondyloarthropathies</z:e> (35 pregnancies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 50.6% had previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> with an anamnestic live-birth rate of 43.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, complications dropped to 28.2% (44/156) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This percentage was very similar to that observed in the 221 pregnancies (29.9%, 66/221) with a live-birth rate of 87.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean neonatal weight was 3018 ± 611 g; mean gestational age at delivery was 38.17 ± 2.79 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, 10.4% of pregnancies resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> and 10.9% newborns had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low weight</z:hpo> at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>APS/RD patients had the worse outcome: 17.6% resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, 14.3% resulted in growth restriction and 50% resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This result was mainly due to patients with APS/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) that had the lowest gestational age at delivery (30.8 ± 3.56 weeks) and the lowest newborn weight (1499 ± 931 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results confirm that a strict follow-up and targeted treatments significantly improve pregnancy outcomes in autoimmune patients with PAPS, SLE and isolated autoAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy outcome in patients with APS/SLE remains unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
