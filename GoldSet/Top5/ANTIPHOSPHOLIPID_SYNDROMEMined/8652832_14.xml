<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum reactivities to a panel of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antigens, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 196 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus-l+ (HIV-1+) patients with CDC II to IVC clinical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant levels of IgG to CL, PS, or both were observed in 23 patients lacking evidence of thrombophilic events or any peculiar clinical feature of HIV-1 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses showed that in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of T cells was increased in patients with high serum anti-PS IgG, whereas the overexpression of Fas/Apo-1 marker was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients regardless of their antiphospholipid reactivities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macrophages from patients with significant titers of anti-PS IgG antibodies were not activated by the presence of apoptotic CEM lymphoblasts or by purified anti-PS IgG from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, these antibodies greatly improved the effector functions of autologous macrophages in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labeled CEM cells, whereas polyspecific IgG were unable to induce an equivalent cytotoxicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increasing effect on ADCC was also observed in tests using macrophages from healthy controls to CEM coated with anti-PS IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support a potential correlation of anti-PS specificity with T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HIV-1 infection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because PS is exteriorized by apoptotic lymphocytes, its persistence may stimulate antibodies which cooperate with macrophages in the clearance of dead cells by an enhanced ADCC mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This interpretation could explain the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in HIV-1+ patients with serum elevations of antiphospholipid reactivities </plain></SENT>
