<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLs) is associated with the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), which comprises venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and pregnancy loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of aPLs has been reported to be different in patient populations affected by either of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the prevalence and clinical associations of aPLs, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), anticardiolipin (aCL), and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-beta2-GPI) in a cohort of Korean patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included samples from 88 SLE patients for whom aPL testing had been advised between June 2006 and July 2009 at the Dong-A University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum and plasma samples were tested for LAC, aCL (IgG, IgM), and anti-beta2-GPI (IgG, IgM) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical data from patients were obtained from a review of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LAC was the most common (34.1% of total patients, 30/88) antibody, followed by IgM aCL (31.8%, 28/88), IgG aCL (18.2%, 16/88), and IgM and IgG anti-beta2-GPI (both 5.7%, 5/88 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positivity for LAC was strongly associated with venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAC was the most common antibody detected in Korean SLE patients and is shown to have a significant association with the presence of venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The measurement of LAC may be clinically useful in identifying patients with SLE who are at a high risk for venous/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
