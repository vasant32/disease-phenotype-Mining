<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The scope of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of patients with aCl and anti-beta2-gpI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ACl were tested in 3,600 consecutive sera in our laboratory between January 1999 and June 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis and prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity were retrospectively reviewed in aCl-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of anti-beta2-gpI antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo> (aPTT), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were investigated in aCl-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 147 aCl-positive patients, 110 women and 37 men with a mean age of 41 years (range 7.8-82.5), were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>42 (28.6%) aCl-positive patients fulfilled the criteria for APS which was secondary to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of anti-beta2-gpI antibodies and LA, prolonged aPTT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in aCl-positive patients was 23.8, 27.2, 25.7 and 9.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of both aCl and anti-beta2-gpI antibodies was strongly associated with clinical symptoms of APS (p = 0.007) compared to p = 0.008 for LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that assessment of anti-beta2-gpI antibodies in addition to aCl is a valuable diagnostic tool in the workup of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
