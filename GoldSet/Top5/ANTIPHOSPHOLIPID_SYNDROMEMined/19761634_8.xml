<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of, and to identify risk factors for, pregnancy-associated venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) requiring hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study (N = 3 852 569) using the Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), for the fiscal years 1991-1992 to 2005-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women with pregnancy-related hospitalizations in Canada (excluding Quebec and Manitoba) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DVT and PE rates were calculated using the number of hospital deliveries (i.e., cohort of women at risk) as the denominator for the antepartum and peripartum (labour and delivery) hospitalizations and for postpartum readmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for DVT/PE were identified using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the antepartum, peripartum, and postpartum periods, 5.4, 7.2, and 4.3 VTE cases per 10,000 pregnancies, respectively were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total incidence of DVT was 12.1 per 10,000 pregnancies (0.26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100,000), and the rate for PE was 5.4 per 10,000 (0.96 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest risk factors for DVT occurrence during the peripartum period were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 15.4; 95% CI 10.8-22.0), a past history of circulatory disease, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0157489" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">major puerperal infection</z:e>, whereas those for PE were previous DVT (aOR 56.9; 95% CI 40.9-79.1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (aOR 43.4, 95% CI 35.0-53.9), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, past history of circulatory disease, transfusion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0157489" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">major puerperal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cases of VTE and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occur most frequently during the peripartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although mortality from pregnancy-associated VTE is low, maternal characteristics and other factors can be used to identify women at risk for VTE </plain></SENT>
