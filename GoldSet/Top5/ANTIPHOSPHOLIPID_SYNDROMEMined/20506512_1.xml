<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> in patients with APS, using late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients with APS and 81 control subjects without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> underwent CMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of occult myocardial ischemic disease, as revealed by LGE, was compared between patients with APS and controls, and factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> were identified in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Myocardial ischemic disease, as characterized by LGE on CMRI, was present in 8 (29.6%) of 27 patients with APS, and imaging with LGE showed a typical pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) in 3 patients (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> revealed on CMRI was not detected by electrocardiography or echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although both patients with APS and control subjects shared a low risk of cardiovascular events, as calculated with the Framingham risk equation (mean +/- SD 5.1 +/- 8.2% and 6.5 +/- 7.6%, respectively, for the absolute risk within the next 10 years; P = 0.932), the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> was more than 7 times higher in patients with APS (P = 0.0006 versus controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> in patients with APS and classic coronary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> tended to be more closely associated with specific features of APS, such as duration of the disease, presence of livedo, and positivity for anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The finding of a significant and unexpectedly high prevalence of occult myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> in patients with APS indicates the usefulness of CMRI with LGE for the identification of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> in such patients </plain></SENT>
