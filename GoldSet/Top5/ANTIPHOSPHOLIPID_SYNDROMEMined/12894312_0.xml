<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequencies and behavior of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in 57 children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anticardiolipin antibodies were investigated by ELISA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> antibodies by the international tests recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> analyses were performed in frozen samples (mean of 5.3 samples per patient obtained during a mean follow-up period of 3 years and 7 months) and on blood samples collected between January 1997 and November 1998 (mean of 2.5 samples per patient during a 2-year follow-up period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (anticardiolipin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>) were similar in the samples collected prospectively and in the frozen samples (retrospective study): 63.2% and 75.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Positivity for these antibodies fluctuated during the follow-up period and was not associated with any clinical or laboratory parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e>, including autoantibodies and also including disease activity and/or severity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> were similar to those observed in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positivity fluctuated during the follow-up and was not correlated with clinical and/or laboratory disease parameters </plain></SENT>
