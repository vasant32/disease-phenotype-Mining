<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the etiology and the optimal treatment of them are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: We encountered a case of AIH complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical course and treatment of this case, and discuss some problems in managing such a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient received low-dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin and delivered a live-born infant at term without any adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this case, there was no relation between the variation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the one of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (GPI)-dependent anticardiolipin antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is supposed that there was no relation between the activity of AIH and the one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and it is also supposed that one is not secondary to the other </plain></SENT>
