<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although recent literature supports the role of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 repeats), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor cleaving protease, in the pathogenesis of the disease, many aspects of the disease remain a mystery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various drugs and autoimmune conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, have been observed in association with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>Adult onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087031" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Still's disease</z:e> (AOSD) has been reported less frequently in association with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 43-year-old African American man who initially presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> and was later diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He responded initially to plasma exchange, but never achieved complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He eventually required splenectomy for complete resolution of symptoms of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> never resolved, resulting in several admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was eventually diagnosed as AOSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Literature review shows that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> usually associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight reports of AOSD with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> have been reported, but our case is unique in several aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous case reports have described <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> occurring in patients with known AOSD; here, we describe <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> preceding or coinciding with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AOSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the patient's AOSD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> responded to plasma exchange, but did not resolve after splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The coincident <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AOSD and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in this patient lead us to suspect a common pathophysiologic pathway in the pathogenesis for both of these diseases </plain></SENT>
