<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Setting: Vall d'Hebron University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects: 122 women, in two groups: Study group: 54 women with RM/UFL and control group: 68 pregnant without RM/UFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention: Antiphospholipid, mainly anti-ANXA5 antibody analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) prevalence in the study group was 10/54 (14.8%) and 5/68 (7.3%) in control group (p=0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the RM subgroup, it was 3/25 and 9/34 in UFL versus 5/68 in controls (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) was present in 4 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> belonging to the study group (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four out of 34 women with UFL were positive for anticardiolipin antibodies-IgG (IgG-aCL) versus 1/68 in controls (p=0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In RM subgroup, anti-ANXA5 antibodies were positive in 2/25 versus 3/68 in controls, and in UFL subgroup, 3/34 versus 3/68 cases (p=1.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to our results, anti-ANXA5 antibodies should not be considered as a risk factor for RM/UFL </plain></SENT>
