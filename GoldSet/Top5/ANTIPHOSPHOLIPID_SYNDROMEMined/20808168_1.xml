<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies subsequently effectively refuted that concept </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 56-year-old woman with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, without clinical or serologic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> subsequent to an elective splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Literature review was performed to identify examples of the effect of splenectomy on other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy has been linked with the development of new autoimmune phenomenon, alterations in the clinical course of patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, such as in our patient, and in a progressive redistribution of memory B cells that may influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> activity and may have been involved in the alteration in our patient's clinical course </plain></SENT>
