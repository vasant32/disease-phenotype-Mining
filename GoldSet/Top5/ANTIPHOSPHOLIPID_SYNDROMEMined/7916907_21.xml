<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their antibodies to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> might bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> on the platelet wall but anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> are asymmetrically located in the inner leaflet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, antibodies to anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> may require beta 2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) as a cofactor in order to bind to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In turn, beta 2GPI has high affinity for anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of this asymmetry occurs upon platelet activation and could thus permit such antibody-beta 2GPI-platelet interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied this by flow cytometry using purified beta 2GPI-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> labelled and similarly labelled affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or phosphatidylserine (aPL) obtained from sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five percent of resting platelets were bound by aPL in the presence of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such binding increased when we activated platelets with various <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, reaching 31% with the concurrent use of thrombin and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> A23187 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation resulted in the expression of GMP140 but this did not correlate with aPL binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This probably reflects that the expression of GMP140, which depends on their secretion of alpha granules, has different <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> responses and occurs at different times than do microvesicle formation and expression of prothrombinase activity which coincide with the loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> asymmetry on the platelet wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When we studied the binding of purified beta 2GPI we also found that it binds preferentially to activated platelets and that it seems to be a prerequisite for the binding of aPL onto them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that aPL from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> may bind to activated platelets through beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
