<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, APS is also characterized by multiple other autoantibodies including 'non-classical' aPL, as well as other antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we describe the autoantigen properties, prevalence and clinical importance of 30 different antibodies in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the other antibodies characterizing APS are autoantibodies directed to platelets, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi>, various coagulation factors, lamins, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antigens and cell surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few of these autoantibodies are correlated with the presence of other antibodies, and some may have an additive role in the pro-thrombotic tendency of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This autoantibody explosion might be important in early identification of the syndrome and its manifestations </plain></SENT>
