<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to prothrombin (aPT) have been associated with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (aPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed variations in aPT assay methodology to optimize an aPT method that was used to screen patients with aPS (n = 66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detection of aPT using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was influenced by the concentration of the capture antigen, the microtitre plate type and the buffer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of gamma-irradiated plates, a phosphate-buffered saline buffer and coating antigen of 10 microg/ml prothrombin was the most sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both serum and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> samples are suitable for the detection of aPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions aPT IgM but not IgG were found to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or fetal loss </plain></SENT>
