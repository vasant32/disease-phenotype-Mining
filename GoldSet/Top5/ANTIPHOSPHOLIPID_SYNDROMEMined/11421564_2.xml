<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 19 patients (15 women and 4 men; age range, 26 to 79 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677607" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hashimoto's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgA, IgG, and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 19 study patients, 4 (21%) tested positive for anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG in 2 and IgM in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with anticardiolipin antibodies did not exhibit a higher titer of antithyroglobulin or anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in comparison with patients without anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no relationship was found between anticardiolipin antibody levels and thyroid hormone replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with high levels of IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies had clinical features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed an increased incidence of anticardiolipin antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677607" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hashimoto's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of these antibodies may be a nonspecific marker of activation of the immune system </plain></SENT>
