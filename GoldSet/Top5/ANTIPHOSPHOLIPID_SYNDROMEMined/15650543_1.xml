<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For instance, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) levels evidence endothelial cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under specific clinical conditions the levels of sTM are raised, such as in patients with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of sTM, as an endothelial injury marker, were evaluated in 65 women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, 19 pregnant women and nine with a history of gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>); 13 of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>sTM levels could be used as a predictor of pregnancy loss in future prospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared those levels with the levels found in control groups without recurrent pregnancy loss (20 healthy women and 14 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences (P = 0.729) in the levels of sTM between the recurrent pregnancy loss group (31.1 ng/ml) and the healthy control group (31.4 ng/ml) or between the different subgroups with recurrent pregnancy loss (P = 0.873) and the healthy control group or the control group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune disorder</z:e> (28.0 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences (P = 0.605) in the levels of sTM among the patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, with or without moderate or high <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (32.0 versus 23.3 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the levels of sTM would not seem to be a useful tool, as an endothelial injury marker, in women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
