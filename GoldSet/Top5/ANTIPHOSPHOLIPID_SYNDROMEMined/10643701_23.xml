<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify the T cells responsive to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) that mediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro proliferative responses and anti-beta2GPI antibody production induced by beta2GPI were examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from 12 APS patients, 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> patients without APS, and 12 healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripheral blood T cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects failed to respond to beta2GPI in its native form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reduced beta2GPI was able to stimulate T cells not only from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients with anti-beta2GPI antibodies, but also from 10 of 25 individuals without anti-beta2GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the responses to beta2GPI was confirmed by activation of the reduced beta2GPI-primed T cells by recombinant beta2GPI in secondary cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the T cell response induced by beta2GPI revealed that the response was associated with the presence of the DR53-associated alleles, the responding T cells were CD4+ and restricted by HLA class II, and antigenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were located in domains IV and/or V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibody production was induced specifically in anti-beta2GPI antibody-positive patients, in PBMC cultures with reduced beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2GPI antibodies produced in vitro recognized beta2GPI immobilized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or beta2GPI coated on "high-binding" <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that CD4+ and HLA class II-restricted T cells responsive to beta2GPI are involved in the production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in APS patients </plain></SENT>
