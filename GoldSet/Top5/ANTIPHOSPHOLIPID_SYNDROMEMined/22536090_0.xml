<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) in a group of subjects suffering from APS against that of a control group with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, matched for age, sex, and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An equal number (n = 31) of subjects with APS, and healthy controls, underwent autonomic evaluation: tilt test, deep breath, Valsalva maneuver, hand grip, lying-to-standing, Stroop, and sweat tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cases in the APS group were positive for the tilt test, relating to changes in respiratory rate intervals, by comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of other tests were also altered significantly in APS cases, by comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(The sweat and Stroop tests were only performed in 14 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1145628" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Autonomic disease</z:e> did not correlate with age, sex, history of disease, arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, or antibody positivity; only their coagulation parameters correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>Autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in APS seems to correlate with coagulation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>APS patients should receive autonomic evaluation, to minimize the risks of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
