<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The importance of β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β(2)GPI)-specific CD4(+) T cells in the development of pathogenic processes in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and APS mouse models is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our objective is to manipulate the β2GPI specific CD4(+) T cells using tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) to induce tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to evaluate the capability of tDCs to induce antigen-specific tolerance in effector/memory T cells from patients with APS and to elucidate the involved mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DCs and tDCs were produced from patients with APS peripheral-blood-monocytes, using specific cytokines. β(2)GPI-specific tolerance induction was investigated by coculturing control DC (cDC) or tDC, β(2)GPI-loaded, with autologous effector/memory T cells, evaluating the proliferative response, phenotype, cytokines secretion, viability and regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Human monocyte-derived DCs treated with interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor β-1 (10/TGF-DC) induced β(2)GPI-specific-unresponsiveness in effector/memory CD4(+) T cells (46.5% ± 26.0 less proliferation) in 16 of 20 analysed patients with APS, without affecting the proliferative response to an unrelated candidin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five analysed patients, 10/TGF-DC-stimulated T cells acquired an IL-2(low)interferon γ(low)IL-10(high) cytokine profile, with just a propensity to express higher numbers of Foxp3(+)CTLA-4(+) cells, but with an evident suppressive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four of 10 analysed patients, 10/TGF-DC-stimulated T cell hyporesponsiveness could not be reverted and showed higher percentages of late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, p&lt;0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The inherent tolerance induction resistance of activated T cells present during the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> has delayed the application of tDC as an alternative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the 10/TGF-DC feasibility to induce antigen-specific unresponsiveness in autoreactive T cells generated in patients with APS by inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or T cells with regulatory abilities </plain></SENT>
