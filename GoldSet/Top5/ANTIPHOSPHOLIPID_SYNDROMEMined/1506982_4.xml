<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each sample was tested after single or combined maneuvers as follows: adsorbed, adsorbed and inactivated, only inactivated, and compared to basal readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase of ACA titers did occur after inactivation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera, but adsorption had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither inactivation nor adsorption changed ACA titer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> sera as a group, although in certain sera there were changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This observation may suggest the presence in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum of a thermolabile factor which modulates ACA binding to its antigen and the reactivity of the anticardiolipin antibodies of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with sheep erythrocyte membrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
