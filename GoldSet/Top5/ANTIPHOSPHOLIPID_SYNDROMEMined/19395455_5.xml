<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate serum complement fixation on platelets and thrombotic incidence using banked sera and clinical data from patients with SLE (n = 91), SLE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) or APS (n = 78) and primary aPL (n = 57) or APS (n = 96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In-situ complement fixation was measured as C1q and C4d deposition on heterologous platelets using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation by patient serum in the fluid phase was assessed via <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced in-situ complement fixation was associated with the presence of IgG aPL and IgG anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 antibodies (P &lt; 0.05) and increased platelet activation (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, enhanced complement fixation, especially C4d deposition on heterologous platelets, was positively associated with arterial thrombotic events in patients with SLE and aPL (P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with aPL possess an enhanced capacity for in-situ complement fixation on platelets </plain></SENT>
