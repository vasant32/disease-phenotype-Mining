<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Together with anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) is the main diagnostic tool for aPL detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since LA determination is based on the finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005542'>prolonged clotting time</z:hpo> in vitro, concomitant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy may significantly interfere with its detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a boy in whom recurrent aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> heralded for several months the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormally increased in vitro clotting times at the time of the second thrombotic event led to the suspicion of the presence of LA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this latter finding was difficult to interpret since the patient was already on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment at the time of our first observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, LA was assayed using a commercial kit in which a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> neutralizer is included (Staclot LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two consecutive samples from the patient were compared with eight patients on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for non-aPL-related thrombotic events and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study showed that, taking into account the concomitant <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment, Staclot LA was positive only in the propositus, raising the suspicion of a possible aPL-related origin of the thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This issue was definitively confirmed in a subsequent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present report shows that aPL-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> can be the earliest clinical manifestation of pediatric SLE, and that Staclot LA may have a role in LA detection during the course of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
