<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 2877 SLE inpatients (age ≥ 18 years, male 363, female 2514) admitted in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 1999 to October 2009, 33 patients [mean age (50.7 ± 12.8) years] were diagnosed with CAD and coronary angiogram was available in 20 out of these 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and coronary features of these patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of CAD was significantly higher in male SLE patients than in female patients [2.48% (9/363) vs. 0.95% (24/2514), P = 0.022] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were more likely to suffer from CAD [5.76% (8/139) vs. 0.91% (25/2738), P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was the major form of CAD (24/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery angiographic changes included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">occlusions, coronary</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and multi-vessel lesions was found in 75.0% (15/20) patients with SLE and CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Male SLE patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are at higher risk for CAD </plain></SENT>
