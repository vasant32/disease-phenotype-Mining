<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the prognostic factors that influence mortality in patients with the catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the case reports of 250 patients included in the CAPS Registry up to February 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify prognostic factors for CAPS, we compared the main clinical and immunologic features and the types of treatment in the patients who died with those features in the patients who survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recovery occurred in 56% of the episodes of CAPS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral involvement, consisting mainly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, was considered the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, being present in 27.2% of patients, followed by cardiac involvement (19.8%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (19.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only factor we identified that was prognostic of a higher mortality rate was the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A higher recovery rate was associated with combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (ACs) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (CS) plus plasma exchange (PE) (77.8%), followed by ACs plus CS plus PE and/or intravenous immunoglobulins (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, concomitant treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> did not demonstrate additional benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral involvement (mainly consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), cardiac involvement, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were considered the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of SLE was related to a higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to the results of the present study, ACs plus CS plus PE should be the first line of therapy in patients with CAPS </plain></SENT>
