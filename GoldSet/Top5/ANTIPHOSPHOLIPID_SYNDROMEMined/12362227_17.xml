<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mixing of patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasmas prior to testing for LA is employed to overcome this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the diagnostic efficacy of <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> clotting time (SCT) and dilute Russell viper venom test (dRVVT) performed at low and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentrations, to diagnose LA in patients on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, in comparison with Staclot LA (Stago) performed with and without hexagonal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case materials were 114 filtered plasmas from patients on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> with (n = 62) and without (n = 52) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasmas were considered LA-positive when Staclot LA (taken as the "gold standard") was diagnostic for LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four plasmas were positive with Staclot LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty and 39 of these were also positive with SCT and dRVVT (sensitivity relative to Staclot LA was 91% and 89%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy plasmas were negative with Staclot LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of these were positive with both SCT and dRVVT (specificity relative to Staclot LA was 96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kappa values for measure of agreement were 0.87 and 0.85 (p &lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SCT and dRVVT performed at low and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentrations without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma can be considered as reliable as Staclot LA performed with hexagonal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma to diagnose LA in patients on oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advantages of SCT and Drvvt over Staclot LA are easy automation, no need for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma and relatively low cost </plain></SENT>
