<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI), which consists of four complement control protein modules and a distinctly folded fifth C-terminal domain, is an essential cofactor for the binding to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, isolated from patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome, and its fifth domain has attracted attention as a specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on the fifth domain of beta2-GPI (Domain V) and examined the interaction of intact Domain V, Domains IV-V, and nicked Domain V with various hydrophobic ligands, as a model molecule of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are important for Domain V binding to the ligand molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found that, while Domain IV has no significant effect on the interactions with ligands, the nicked Domain V with cleavage in the flexible loop decreases the affinity, indicating that the flexible loop region is the binding site of the hydrophobic ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> corresponding to the loop region was disordered and interacted with bis-ANS, confirming the critical role of the loop region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To clarify the nature of the interaction between the loop region and hydrophobic compounds, we prepared the reduced and alkylated Domain V, which was denatured but was assumed to be a collapsed state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alkylation by iodoacetic acid decreased the interaction of Domain V with bis-ANS, probably because the protein net charge was decreased by the six introduced carboxyl groups and consequently the electrostatic interactions were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Domain V alkylated by iodoacetamide, therefore retaining a high positive net charge, bound bis-ANS more strongly than the intact Domain V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the interaction of Domain V with hydrophobic compounds through the flexible loop is similar to the binding of hydrophobic compounds to the protein folding intermediate </plain></SENT>
