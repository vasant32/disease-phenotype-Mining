<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA), also associated with RVO, are a marker for the prothrombotic condition <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, in which antiendothelial antibodies (AECA) are also frequently present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study reviewed 45 younger patients &lt;or=55 years old (21 with branch, 22 with central and 2 with hemispheric RVO) to examine: (1) the r√¥le of factor V:Q506 in the pathogenesis of RVO, and (2) the prevalence and titre of ACA and AECA in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No patient had the factor V:Q506 mutation indicating no increase in frequency above background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that primary screening for factor V:Q506 is not indicated for young patients with RVO who do not have historical evidence suggesting familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients had low-titre ACA (&gt;10 GPL units); in 6 of these, the titre was &gt;20 GPL units (population reference range = 0-10 GPL units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had antiendothelial cell reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low-titre ACA may therefore represent a non-specific response to vascular injury </plain></SENT>
