<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is, however, possible that complement activation is also involved in other causes of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted a study to determine whether fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is associated with changes in the maternal plasma concentrations of complement split products or anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was designed to include <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women (n=60) and patients with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n=60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were classified according to the cause of fetal demise into: a) unexplained (n=44); b) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> (n=8); and c) associated with chromosomal abnormalities or major congenital fetal anomalies (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentrations of C3a, C4a and C5a were measured using sensitive and specific ELISAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) The median plasma concentration of C5a was higher in patients with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women [median 16 ng/mL (range 4.5-402.5) vs. median 11.6 ng/mL (range 1.2-87.1), respectively; P&lt;0.001]; 2) patients with an unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> had a higher median plasma C5a concentration than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women (P=0.002 and P&lt;0.001, respectively); 3) no differences were observed in the maternal plasma concentrations of C3a and C4a among the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is associated with evidence of complement activation </plain></SENT>
