<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Centres with very good clinical practice in APS and with large cohorts of patients could join other centres with better research experience, thus allowing the study of basic patho-mechanisms in large series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the specialists would be able to compare their cohorts of patients, which, being as they are recruited in very different fields of medicine, could enlighten the different aspects of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, continuous comparison of patients' data suggested that even the laboratory diagnostic procedures needed collaborative work in order to make reproducible results, at least of the classical tests--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLas) and anti β(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies (anti-β(2)GPIs)--and of the consequent clinical diagnosis in different centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this way, the wide exchange of information could also favour the introduction and evaluation of new tests </plain></SENT>
