<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that a certain amount of PLs in the dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (dRVVT) test system is required to express LA activity of anti beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now extended this observation to two other tests, i.e., Kaolin Clotting Time (KCT) in which PLs are not added, and Tissue Thromboplastin Inhibition test (TTI) in which PLs are extremely diluted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, affinity-purified antibody preparations from 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> did not express or only weakly expressed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> activity in both tests; the mean ratios of coagulation times obtained with purified antibodies and that of control buffer were 1.11 and 1.0 for KCT and TTI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the mean ratios in dRVVT were 1.31 and 1.49 at a PLs dilution of 1:8 and 1:64, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the presence of LA activity due to autoantibodies to beta2-GPI is characterized by a positive dRVVT and negative or only weakly positive KCT and TTI </plain></SENT>
