<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Sera were collected from patients and work-up was done for detection of ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The work-up was done for detection of antibodies once in every 6 weeks for 14 times consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The repeated and combined detection of ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection could raise the positivity rate up to 21.8% (P &lt; 0.05) in comparison with positive for ACA alone (14.1%), positive for anti-beta2-GPI alone (3.1%), and concurrently positive for both ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 91 confirmed positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>) patients, with more frequent screening for ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies, more patients with <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of five and more screenings was over 81.32%, which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), in comparison with that of four or less screenings (68.13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data implied that it would be appropriate to take over five or more screenings of combined ACA and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies detection in suspect patients to facilitate the positive diagnostic rate for autoimmune type RSA </plain></SENT>
