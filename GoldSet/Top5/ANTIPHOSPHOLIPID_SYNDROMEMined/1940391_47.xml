<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The requirement of plasma cofactor beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I for binding autoantibodies against anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies using highly purified beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I for coating microtitre plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation, determined with serum pools of low, medium and high positivity, ranged between 3% and 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>54 sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> were analyzed by this assay; the results correlated well to those obtained in an ELISA using anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> on the solid phase (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two ELISA systems showed similar sensitivities although 8/31 positive sera scored negative in the beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter group of eight sera showed significantly higher anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi>/anti-phosphatidylserine binding ratios than the group of 23 sera which scored positive in both assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This new assay should permit accurate measurement of most of the clinically relevant anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies and avoid inconsistencies likely to arise from secondary interactions that characterize <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-based ELISA </plain></SENT>
