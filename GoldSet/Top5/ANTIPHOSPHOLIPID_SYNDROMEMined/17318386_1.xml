<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective case-control study based on the evaluation of IgG, IgM and IgA aCL, and IgG and IgA abeta2GPI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> patients and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were asked about any occurrence of thrombotic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, women were asked about pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> patients and 50 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgM aCL were not detected in study group or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IgG aCL were found in two patients and in one control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL were significantly more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> patients compared with controls (13/50 (26%) vs. 2/50 (4%), p=0.004, OR [95% CI]=9.09 [1.81-50]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference for the prevalence of IgG and IgA abeta2GPI between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were noted in two patients with negative antibodies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IgA aCL were more frequently detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, no clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were noted </plain></SENT>
