<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 patients, 9 (45%) had one or more changes suggestive of activation of the hemostatic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such changes were more frequently observed in patients with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had changes in the fibrinolytic system (high plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels) and 2 in the natural <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (low antithrombin III activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had increased plasma fibrinogen levels and 6 patients had slightly increased levels of anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the changes observed were not related to the type, location or activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that various biochemical abnormalities may be found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, which may account for their increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and suggest that multiple mechanisms may interact in determining such complications </plain></SENT>
