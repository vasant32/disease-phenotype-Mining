<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine if point-of-care testing of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is influenced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared 59 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) to 49 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> to evaluate the consistency between INR results obtained by different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INR results obtained by finger stick (capillary whole-blood) and venipuncture (non-citrated and citrated whole-blood) were compared with our laboratory plasma-based prothrombin time assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (8%) with APS and both elevated anti-beta2glycoprotein I levels and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> had non-measurable ProTime INR results and generally higher Hemochron Signature INR results than the plasma-based method, but the corresponding chromogenic factor X results were not supratherapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the remaining patients, differences between the plasma-based INR and the point-of-care INR results ranged from 0.2 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences were similar for patients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> INR comparisons with the exception of the plasma-based method compared with the ProTime, which showed a mean absolute difference of 0.4 +/- 0.3 for APS patients and of 0.2 +/- 0.2 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subset ofAPS patients, the ProTime system will not yield an INR result and the HEMochron Signature (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> and non-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> whole-blood) INR results will exhibit elevated INR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this subset of APS patients, we suggest using an alternative method to monitor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
