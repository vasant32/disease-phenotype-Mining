<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac manifestations include coronary by-pass graft and angioplasty occlusions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> and complications of cardiovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> was defined as Libman-Sacks nonbacterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown a linear subendothelial deposition of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>/beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) antibodies in the valve specimens derived from APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The involvement of complement C3c in the pathogenesis was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the beta2GPI-related target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognized by the anti-beta2GPI Abs on the valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to find the beta2GPI-related target <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by the anti-beta2GPI antibodies on the valves, we used beta2GPI-related synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-beta2GPI Abs on the studied valves was detected by anti-idiotypic antibody, followed by immunoperoxidase analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> attached to the N-terminal of beta2GPI-related synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and control <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were used to identify the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> addressed by the anti-beta2GPI Abs deposited on the patient's valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The binding was probed by streptavidin-peroxidase and appropriate substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The specificity was confirmed by competition assays with control <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and anti-idiotypic antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the beta2GPI-related synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were found in previous studies to mimic common pathogens either bacteriae or viruses, which raised a possible infectious origin for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, TLRVYK, is a specific target for anti-beta2GPI Abs deposited on the APS valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was able to displace the anti-anti-beta2GPI anti-idiotypic Abs for binding the anti-beta2GPI Abs on the valve by a competition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We point to the possibility that Libman-Sacks nonbacterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> may have an infectious origin </plain></SENT>
