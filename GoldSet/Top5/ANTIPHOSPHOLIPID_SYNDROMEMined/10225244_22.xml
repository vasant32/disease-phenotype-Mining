<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I are more strongly associated with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> than are anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found a decrease in anticardiolipin antibodies at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and levels of antibodies to beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I and to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> before, during, and after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with SLE, and to compare them with patients who did not have <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 24 patients with SLE who had at least one episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 102 patients with SLE without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using newborn calf serum as the blocking agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies were measured by ELISA on nonirradiated plates, using purified human beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies, compared with only 17% of controls (P &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant decrease in serum anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I levels at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, as compared with previous and subsequent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and levels of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were similar in patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease in IgG or IgM anticardiolipin titers occurred during <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, and immunosuppressive treatments did not appear to affect anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I levels at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I antibodies are strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The decrease of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I levels at the time of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may indicate a pathogenic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This antibody may also be a marker of predisposition for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
