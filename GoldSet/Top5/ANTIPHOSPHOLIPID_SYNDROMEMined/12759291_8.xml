<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from four groups of patients were studied by an in house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I: 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) (median age 32.5 years, range 25-34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were positive for IgG/M aCL or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group II: 28 patients with unexplained pregnancy morbidity (median age 35 years, range 23-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven had history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were positive for IgG/M aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None from this group fulfilled Sapporo criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group III: 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (median age 34 years, range 25-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patients had IgG/M aCL and/or LA, but only 19 fulfilled Sapporo criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgA aCL were found in 12, 6, and 14 patients from the groups with PAPS, unexplained pregnancy morbidity, and SLE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients had these antibodies together with IgG/IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients from the group with unexplained pregnancy morbidity and two with SLE had IgA aCL alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IgA abeta(2)GPI was present in one patient from each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> IgA abeta(2)GPI were present together with IgG and/or IgM abeta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgA aCL is high in patients with pregnancy morbidity, although IgA aCL are usually present together with IgG and/or IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>IgA abeta(2)GPI are not useful in identifying additional women with APS and pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
