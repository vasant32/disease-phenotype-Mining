<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) in paediatric patients affected with SLE, JCA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndromes</z:e> (OS) and correlated the presence of aCL and LA with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>aCL were assayed by enzyme-limited immunoassay; LA was determined by activated partial thromboplastin time and the kaolin clotting time test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aCL and LA assays were performed in parallel on at least two occasions over a 7-30-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen out of nineteen (79%) SLE patients had aCL and 8/19 (42%) had LA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five out of six symptomatic patients had both LA and high-titre aCL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the simultaneous positivity for LA and high-titre aCL allows the identification of paediatric SLE patients who are at risk not only for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, but also for other <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>-related clinical features </plain></SENT>
