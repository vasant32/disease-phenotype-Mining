<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients, [26 APLA-positive (APLA(+)) and 21 APLA-negative (APLA(-))] matched for age, sex, disease duration, MRI characteristics, disability, and time on IFN-beta treatment, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were on intramuscular (IM) IFN-beta1a for at least 3 years and remained on the same treatment over the 3-year duration of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The APLA(+) group accumulated significantly higher T2-LV over the 3-year follow-up than the APLA(-) group (+31% versus -1·1%, P = 0·043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTR of T1-LV (-3·3% versus +4·7%, P = 0·04) in the APLA(+) group was lower compared to the APLA(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3-year follow-up, the APLA(+) group had increased tissue damage as measured by diffusion entropy (+4% versus -2·5%, P = 0·019) and whole brain volume loss (-0·69% versus -0·37%, P = 0·041), compared to the APLA(-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were more clinical relapses in the MS APLA(+) group compared to APLA(-) patients (18 versus 10) and a higher frequency of sustained disability progression (7/26 or 27% versus 2/21 or 9·5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that APLA(+) RRMS patients treated with IFN-beta1a develop more severe MRI and clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to evaluate the role of APLA as potential biomarkers for disease prognosis versus predictors for therapeutic response to IFN-beta therapy </plain></SENT>
