<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with a singleton gestation, gestational age lower than 12 weeks, and absence of medical diseases before pregnancy were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disorders</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and antiphospholipides syndrome were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antrophometric maternal parameters and bioelectrical impedance measurements were performed during the first, second, third trimester of pregnancy, at delivery and 60 days after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Height(2)/resistance (cm(2)/Omega) and height(2)/reactance (cm(2)/Omega) were utilized to estimate the total and extracellular body water amounts, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spearman rank correlations and cox proportional hazard modelling were used for statistical purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 169 patients completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total and extracellular water amounts significantly increase as pregnancy advances and return to the pre-pregnancy values within 60 days after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for gestational age at delivery, fetal sex, and smoking habits, height(2)/resistance at 25 weeks (hazard=1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.06, P&lt;0.005), height(2)/resistance at 30 weeks (hazard=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P&lt;0.005), height(2)/reactance at 20 weeks (hazard=1.03,95% CI 1.01-1.05, P&lt;0.005), and height(2)/reactance at 25 weeks (hazard=1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P&lt;0.01) were found to be independent predictors of birth weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have provided reference ranges for bioimpedance analysis during pregnancy, an easy, fast and non invasive method to estimate the body water composition during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bioelectrical impedance indices during the second trimester of pregnancy are independently related to the birth weight </plain></SENT>
