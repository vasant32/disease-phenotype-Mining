<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> interfere with the activity of activated protein C (APC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This acquired form of APC resistance has been proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We wanted to investigate the inhibitory effect of recombinant APC (rAPC) on ex vivo thrombin generation in plasma and the modification of this effect by the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: We analyzed plasmas from 81 patients with LA (52 patients fulfilling the criteria for the APS) and 91 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percent inhibition of the endogenous thrombin potential (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi>) as a parameter of APC sensitivity was determined in plasmas using a thrombin generation-based APC resistance test probed with rAPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were normalized using pooled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma (PNP) as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Normalized percent inhibition of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="4885">ETP</z:chebi> by APC was lower in patients with LA [61.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 45.8-74.5%] compared to controls (107.8%, 95% CI: 107.1-109.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with LA and APS, median inhibition was lower than in patients with LA without APS (44.6%, 95% CI: 30.1-55.7% vs. 78.8%, 95% CI: 73.9-95.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference also persisted when patients on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy were excluded from the APS subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APC resistance can be demonstrated with a thrombin generation-based test in a majority of patients with the LA laboratory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A history of thrombotic events in patients with LA is associated with a stronger resistance to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect of APC </plain></SENT>
