<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: : To assess the laboratory approach for investigation of LA, as well as the utility of various tests and test approaches, given a difficult clinical scenario in which LA might or might not be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-three participants in the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) Haematology Quality Assurance Program (QAP) were sent 4 â€ŠmL of a complex but strongly positive LA sample blinded to the nature of the abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three (79%) participants returned results and in most cases diagnostic interpretations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The laboratory approach to LA investigation of this sample was quite varied: 34.7% of participants concluded the sample was LA negative, with 91.7% of these performing dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) testing without mixing, whereas 43.5% of participants identified a strong LA, with 96.7% of these having performed mixing studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most laboratories reporting negative LA instead identified the false presence of specific factor inhibitors against a variety of factors, including II, V and VIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For this difficult challenge, performance of non-mixing dRVVT was associated with a high false negative LA rate </plain></SENT>
