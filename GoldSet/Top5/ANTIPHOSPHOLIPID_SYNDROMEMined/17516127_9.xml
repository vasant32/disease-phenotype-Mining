<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients met <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> criteria and had 13 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 14 exacerbations of the disease during pregnancy (19.4%), with most flares being mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common obstetric complications were gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 15 pregnancies (20.8%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> in 8 pregnancies (11%) </plain></SENT>
