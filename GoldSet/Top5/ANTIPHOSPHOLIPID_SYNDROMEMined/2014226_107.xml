<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact role of aCL antibodies in pathogenesis is not clear and the mechanism by which the antibodies may induce the various manifestations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study we evaluated the effect of passive transfer of aCL antibodies (to the tail vein of naive mice) on fecundity, fetal loss (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e>), and the weight of embryos and placentae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of aCL antibodies were employed: (i) mouse monoclonal aCL antibodies derived from a BALB/c mouse in which experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> was induced by a pathogenic idiotype (idiotype 16/6) of anti-DNA antibodies and (ii) polyclonal IgG and IgM aCL antibodies derived from serum of a patient with primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After infusion of either antibody (10 micrograms per mouse) we could demonstrate lower fecundity rate, increased resorption index of embryos (equivalent to recurrent fetal loss), lower number of embryos per pregnancy, and lower mean weights of embryos and placentae in comparison to mice infused with appropriate control immunoglobulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the aCL antibodies may have direct effects on fecundity and on the outcome of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
