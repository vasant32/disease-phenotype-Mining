<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The defining feature of the condition is the presence of raised levels of antibodies to negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe 2 cases of APS with ocular involvement and review the recent literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was the presenting symptom in one case--a finding that led to the diagnosis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Management with anticoagulation therapy, in which the International Normalised Ratio (INR) has been maintained at or above 3, resulted in reperfusion of the ischaemic retina and stabilisation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in one patient, whilst in the other case, where the INR was less than 3, irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> appears to result in reperfusion of ischaemic retina with stabilisation of the neovascular process when the INR is greater than 3 </plain></SENT>
