<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of antibodies against epidermis induced by IFN-alpha therapy, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting (WB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We have studied the sera of 47 patients treated with low doses of IFN-alpha 2a for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> or cutaneous T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> for a period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These sera were tested by standard IIF and WB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 32% of patient sera were positive after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against epidermis were most often of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus</z:e> type as confirmed by WB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two types of labeling were noted for anti-basement membrane antibodies: basal cytoplasmic pattern in 4 sera and along the dermal side of the basal keratinocytes in 2 sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study brings biological arguments to confirm the direct role of IFN-alpha in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus</z:e>-like eruption, and emphasizes the need for clinical follow-up of patients treated with IFN-alpha over a long period of time </plain></SENT>
