<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the relationship between MHC class II antigens and PAPS in 19 patients from the south of Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariant analysis showed an association between PAPS and HLA-DQ7 (47% vs 25%l P = 0.3), DR4 (32% vs 16%; P = 0.08) and DQ3 (63% vs 39%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, multivariant analysis confirmed the association with DQ7 (RR = 2.5; CI 80%: 1.3-4.7) and DR4 (RR = 2.2; CI 80%: 1.1-4.4) but not with DQ3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we introduced DRw53 into this analysis, we noticed a DR4 confounding effect, with DQ7 (RR = 3.1; CI 80%: 1.7-5.8) and Drw53 (RR = 2.3; CI 80%: 1.2-4.4) remaining as the most important HLA antigens related to PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in PAPS patients from the South of Spain, HLA-DQ7 antigen showed the highest relative risk for PAPS, followed by DRw53 </plain></SENT>
