<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results obtained from culture supernatants demonstrated that aCL crossreacts with myelin-derived acidic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> sulfatide, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> endotoxin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47040">lipid A</z:chebi> and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results obtained from sera showed a significant correlation between levels of aCL and anti-sulfatide antibody, and between levels of aCL and anti-HUVEC antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that aCL can bind to the myelin sheath and HUVEC, which may have implications for the pathogenic potential of aCL for <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
