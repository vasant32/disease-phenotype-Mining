<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical spectrum of patients with primary catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (P-CAPS) to those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-associated CAPS (SLE-CAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Internet-based CAPS Registry to compare the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 127 P-CAPS patients to 103 SLE-CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis, we also determined the poor prognostic factors for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the time of CAPS diagnosis, compared to patients with P-CAPS, those with SLE-CAPS were more likely to be female and younger; have cerebral and pancreatic involvement; receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>; demonstrate a lower prevalence of high titer (&gt; or = 80 U) IgG anticardiolipin antibody; and have a higher risk for mortality after adjusting for age, sex, organ involvement, and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on a logistic regression analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> use was associated with increased mortality in P-CAPS but improved survival in SLE-CAPS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SLE is a poor prognostic factor in patients with CAPS and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> may be beneficial in those with SLE-CAPS </plain></SENT>
