<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antibodies may induce fibrinolytic defects and preliminary data indicate an association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma anti-tPA antibody levels in 91 consecutive patients with APS, 91 healthy controls, 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> without APS symptoms, and 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and APS symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS had anti-tPA antibody levels higher than controls (P = .0001), patients with SLE (P = .0001), and asymptomatic antiphospholipid patients (P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 53 patients had plasma levels of tPA antigen higher (P = .0001) and tPA activity lower (P = .05) than controls, with an inverse correlation (r = -0.454; P = .003) between anti-tPA antibody levels and tPA activity and no correlation with tPA antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2 patients with the highest antibody levels had tPA activity below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their antibodies were, respectively, IgG1 and IgG3; both recognized human tPA, recombinant tPA, and the catalytic domain of tPA, but not beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I, prothrombin, or plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that anti-tPA antibodies specifically interacting with the catalytic domain of tPA can be found in patients with APS, representing a possible cause of hypofibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
