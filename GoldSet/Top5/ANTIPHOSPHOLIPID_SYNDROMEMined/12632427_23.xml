<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> (AVN), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), with or without anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), who are asymptomatic for AVN and have not taken <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine subjects who were asymptomatic for AVN were evaluated by MRI of the femoral heads: 30 patients with primary APS who had never received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, 19 SLE patients who had never received steroids (divided into 2 groups, aCL positive and aCL negative, in order to examine any association between AVN and aCL), and 30 healthy subjects who were age- and sex-matched with patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Established MRI criteria were used for a diagnosis of AVN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asymptomatic AVN was evident in 6 (20%) of 30 patients with primary APS: 3 of them (1 man, 2 women) had intermediate bilateral AVN, and 3 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women) had early AVN (bilateral in 1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of hip and pelvis radiography and dynamic scintigraphy were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Followup MRI 6 months later revealed no changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of the initial MRI examination, the mean (+/-SD) age of patients in whom AVN was identified was 31.2 +/- 7.3 years, and that of patients without AVN was 42.4 +/- 11.9 years (P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Livedo reticularis</z:hpo> occurred significantly more commonly in the group with AVN (P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the healthy subjects and none of the patients with SLE demonstrated AVN on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AVN can be detected by MRI in 20% of patients with primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Younger patients tend to develop AVN more frequently than do older patients, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> may identify individuals at risk for AVN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware of this possible clinical manifestation of primary APS, because early diagnosis can lead to early intervention </plain></SENT>
