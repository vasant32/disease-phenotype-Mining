<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with APS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) managed at the Rheumatology Department of the Bichat University Hospital, Paris, between 1987 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected by chart review and by a 1997 standardized telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 108 patients with APS managed during the ten-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to classical classification criteria, 39 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) and 69 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (SAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Family history data were obtained for 29 (74%) and 55 (80%) PAPS and SAPS patients. respectively (78% of the 108 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve PAPS (41% and 19 SAPS (35%) patients had one or more relatives with evidence of at least one clinical feature of APS such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent fetal loss; of these patients, seven in the PAPS (24%) and 11 in the SAPS (20%) group had two or more relatives with evidence of a clinical feature of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three PAPS (10%) and 14 SAPS (25%) patients had one or more family members with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A positive family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is common in patients with PAPS or SAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding supports a genetic contribution to APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of a positive family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> tend to be higher in patients with SAPS than in those with PAPS </plain></SENT>
