<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We synthesized a tetrameric conjugate of the domain 1 of beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (LJP 993) aimed at developing the conjugate as a Toleragen to suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies focused on determining the stability, tissue distribution, plasma concentration-time profile and excretion of the LJP 993 in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stability of LJP 993 in mouse plasma was quantitatively evaluated using strong <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-exchange high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>( 125)I-labeled LJP 993 was intravenously injected to mice, and levels of (125)I-labeled LJP 993 in plasma, tissues, urine and feces were determined at known intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of LJP 993 with mouse serum at 37 degrees C for 8 h resulted in a decrease by 34% of LJP 993 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No degradation fragment was observed during the incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a single intravenous administration of (125)I-LJP 993 (0.5 and 5 mg/kg) to mice, both C(max) and area-under-curve values increased in a dose-proportional manner, and blood radioactivity disappeared in a bi-exponential manner with the distribution half-lives equal to 1.7 min, and the elimination half-lives 188 and 281 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The (125)I-LJP 993 was moderately distributed into organs and tissues with the exception that brain level of ( 125)I-LJP 993 was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major sites of (125)I-LJP 993 uptake were the kidney (at 30 min post dosing), and kidney, lung, liver, heart, spleen, skin, muscle and fat tissues (at 4 h post dosing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cumulative urinary and fecal radioactivity for 0-48 h post dosing accounted for 44.7% and 4.2% of the administered dose, respectively, with the fast rate of urinal excretion occurring within the first 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, LJP 993 was fairly stable in mouse plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After administration to mice, (125)I-LJP 993 was taken up mainly by kidney and then distributed extensively to tissues except brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both C(max) and area-under-curve values increased in a dose-proportional manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was predominantly excreted in the urine with an elimination half-life longer than 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Kidney is a major route to excrete the tetrameric conjugate </plain></SENT>
