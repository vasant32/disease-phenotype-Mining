<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, the hallmark of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, are associated with both venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite some reports stating that this association may be present in patients with low titres of anticardiolipin antibodies, a clear association has only been established in the presence of a moderate to high concentrations (above 40 GPL or MPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to study whether low antibody titres could be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we reviewed the files of 196 patients, 94 with and 102 without thrombotic events, for a period of 4.4 and 5.1 years respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Files from patients with persistent low titres of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> recorded in the unit database were selected, independently of the associated clinical history or diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epidemiology, clinical and treatment information were collected and the serum variability of the antibody titres was analysed in relation to the presence of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombotic events were classified as venous 81.9% and arterial 18.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>23/94 (24.5%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between serum concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the thrombotic and non-thrombotic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was a higher consistency of the antibody concentrations in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, as seen by the significantly lower variability of IgG aCL and abeta2GP1 titres in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when compared to non-thrombotic controls (p=0.0025 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Consistency of low titres of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> levels may be associated with a higher risk of thrombotic events overall </plain></SENT>
