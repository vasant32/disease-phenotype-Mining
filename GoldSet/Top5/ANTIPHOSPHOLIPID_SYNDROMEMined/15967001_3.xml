<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunoadsorption is an adsorption technique for extracorporeal removal of circulating autoantibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To prevent microbial growth during storage, the protein A columns are primed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9546">thiomersal</z:chebi>, which contains toxic ethyl mercury, which may be released during the procedure and potentially begin to accumulate and become toxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reduce the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9546">thiomersal</z:chebi>-related mercury release during immunoadsorption treatment, we introduced a modified rinsing solution containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>, which is an <z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> mercury scavenger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients received 17 protein A immunoadsorption treatments and their venous blood samples were collected immediately before and after each session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total blood mercury levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry, and the ethyl mercury levels by atomic fluorescence spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the manufacturer's recommendations, we used 600 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> to rinse the mercury from protein-loaded columns before each immunoadsorption treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After immunoadsorption, the ethyl mercury levels increased from 0.148 +/- 0.402 ng/g to 2.026 +/- 1.944 ng/g (P &lt; 0.001), and the total blood mercury levels increased from 2.447 +/- 3.065 ng/g to 20.437 +/- 28.603 ng/g (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-treatment values of total blood mercury exceeded the upper safety level of 5 ng/g in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 immunoadsorption treatments, but no patient developed clinical signs of mercury toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of our study showed an increase in total blood mercury and ethyl mercury levels during the immunoadsorption treatments, suggesting mercury release from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9546">thiomersal</z:chebi>-primed columns despite the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> to the rinsing solution </plain></SENT>
