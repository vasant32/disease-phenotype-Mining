<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of primary <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome presenting as a posttransplant complication in a renal transplant donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A renal donor presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, painless <z:hpo ids='HP_0100519'>anuria</z:hpo> due to renal artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 6 years following renal transplant surgery, subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of jugular catheter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> occurred, despite anticoagulation treatment, due to primary <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This incident represents the most catastrophic complication reported in a renal donor due to primary <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The validity of a prothrombotic assay in an organ donor workup to detect predilection to hypercoagulable disorders and to prevent such complications is open to question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actual significance of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in the blood is unclear; hence, the presence of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> in a potential renal donor would pose an ethical and practical dilemma </plain></SENT>
