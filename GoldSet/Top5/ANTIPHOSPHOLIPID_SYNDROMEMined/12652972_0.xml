<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 47-year-old woman with a 20-year history of generalized MG had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had undergone thymectomy 10 years previously and was treated for phlebothrombosis of the lower extremity 3 years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the left frontal lobe and a new lesion in the right parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple small cortical and subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were demonstrated on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images </plain></SENT>
