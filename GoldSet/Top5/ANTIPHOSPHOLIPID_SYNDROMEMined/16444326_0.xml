<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rational and risk-adapted administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis depends on 1. the identification of those women who have an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 2. the accurate quantification of this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In women without prior <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the presence of a heterozygous factor V Leiden or heterozygous G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene is associated with a pregnancy-associated thrombotic risk of approximately 1 in 400 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, in pregnant carriers of either one of these mutations the risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, no <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A combination of the two genetic risk factors can increase the risk to a modest level of 1 in 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women with a single episode of prior <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with a transient risk factor, e.g. surgery or trauma, and no additional genetic risk factor, the probability of a pregnancy-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> appears also to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, data are sparse and conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in women with a prior idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> who carry an additional hereditary risk factor or who have a positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a high risk (&gt;10%) can be expected supporting the indication for active antepartum and postpartum <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the remarkable progress in risk stratification, the absolute magnitude of risk and the optimal management in many cases is an issue of ongoing debate </plain></SENT>
