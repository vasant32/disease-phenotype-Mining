<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 2-year-7-month old Thai girl presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0009276'>ecchymosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> at both thighs and right ear lobe after a self-limited <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The investigations revealed prolonged APTT and PT, prothrombin level 6% and positive anticardiolipin antibody 26.2 IU/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 1:1 mixture of her plasma and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma could not normalize her APTT and PT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitor to prothrombin determined by Bethesda method was 0.62 BU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was responsive to 20 ml/kg of FFP transfusion, followed by 10 ml/kg at an interval of 12 h for three days and daily 500 units of prothrombin complex concentrate administration for three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At two-week follow-up, she had no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> symptom, coagulation tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, prothrombin level was normalized at 94%, no inhibitor to prothrombin was detected, and anticardiolipin antibody became negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional DNA analysis of her prothrombin gene revealed nine different polymorphisms for which seven had been found in patients with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020640" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prothrombin deficiency</z:e> and two were novel (4096T--&gt;C, 4097T--&gt;C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These single nucleotide polymorphisms are not the disease-causing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, neither known mutations inducing congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020640" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prothrombin deficiency</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired hypoprothrombinemia</z:e> was concluded as the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in this reported patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It might be caused by the transient low titer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>, which was responsive to replacement therapy of FFP and prothrombin complex concentrate </plain></SENT>
