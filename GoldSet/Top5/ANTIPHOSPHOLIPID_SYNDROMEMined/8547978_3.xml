<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 3 day-old fullterm newborn suffering from cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and bilateral massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was found to have anticardiolipin antibodies detected during the neonatal period and 7 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of pathology in the mother or perinatal asphyxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, anticardiolipin antibodies were present in the mother 5 and 15 weeks after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Association of anticardiolipin antibodies and vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has never been reported in the neonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistence of such antibodies favor the hypothesis that they are not transmitted by the mother; they could represent an early manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
