<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factor XIII (FXIII) Val34Leu polymorphism is a newly described polymorphism which is located in the three amino acids away from the thrombin activation site of the FXIII-A subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the Leu allele decreases the risk of both arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the association between the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism and the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty APS patients with arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPLA) positive patients with first trimester abortus and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 126 healthy controls, and 60 healthy subjects who were age- and sex-matched with thrombotic APS group were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FXIII Leu allele frequencies in the APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, aPLA-positive patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, healthy controls, and matched controls were 13.3, 16, 19.5, and 18.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we compared Leu allele frequencies between APS patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and aPLA-positive patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, healthy controls or matched controls, we could not find any difference (chi2, p = 0.43, and P = 0.09, P = 0.67, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the FXIII Leu allele has no protective effect in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
