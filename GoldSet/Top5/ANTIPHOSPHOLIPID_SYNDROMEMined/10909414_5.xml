<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibodies are present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and are associated with the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-endothelial cell antibodies that react with constitutive antigens on ECs are present in patients with vasculiditis and other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both types of antibodies can activate ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frequent findings in APLS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> are fibrin deposits and thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These indicate that the coagulation system is activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of activation is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECs generate tissue factor upon stimulation with various substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study we report that monoclonal anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies and AECAs, derived from a patient with primary APLS and a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, respectively, induce a potent tissue factor in ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The production of TF activity, TF antigen and TF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is dose and time dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TF activity was induced also by F(ab)2 but not by Fc fragments and was abolished completely by pre-incubation with ant-TF antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The TF that is induced in ECs by AECAs with and without beta 2-GPI specificity may activate the coagulation and thereby play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in diseases that are associated with the presence of these antibodies </plain></SENT>
