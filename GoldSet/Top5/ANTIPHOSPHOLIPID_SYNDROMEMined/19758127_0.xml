<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) of new fully automated immunoassays for anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (anti-beta2-GPI) auto-antibody detection (EliA-Phadia), and compared the results with those obtained with Orgentec and Inova ELISA methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two APS patients and 123 controls (20 syphilis, 33 Lyme disease, 30 HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100778'>cryoglobulinemia</z:hpo>, 40 healthy subjects) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the 99(th) percentile cutoff, the sensitivity and specificity of EliA aCL IgG, aCL IgM, anti-beta2-GPI IgG, and anti-beta2-GPI IgM were 69.4% and 81.9%, 64.5% and 86.7%, 64.5% and 98.8%, and 53.2% and 92.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Sydney criteria cutoff (&gt;40 GPL/MPL units), sensitivity and specificity of EliA aCL IgG and aCL IgM were 45.2% and 98.8%, and 35.5% and 97.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The best diagnostic efficiency was obtained combining the aCL tests (&gt;40 GPL/MPL units) with the anti-beta2-GPI tests (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 90.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curves for EliA, Orgentec, and Inova methods were 0.870, 0.940, and 0.850 for aCL IgG; 0.820, 0.820, and 0.820 for aCL IgM; 0.910, 0.960, and 0.920 for anti-beta2-GPI IgG; 0.840, 0.840, and 0.820 for anti-beta2-GPI IgM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the overall agreement between EliA assays and the other two ELISA methods ranged from moderate (anti-beta2-GPI IgG EliA versus Orgentec: Cohen's k = 0.426) to good (anti-beta2-GPI IgM EliA vs. Inova: k = 0.841) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, newly developed EliA methods for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> detection perform similarly to other ELISA assays and represent a useful tool for APS laboratory diagnosis in daily practice </plain></SENT>
