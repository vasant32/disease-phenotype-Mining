<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and multiple thromboses who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) and subsequent international normalized ratio (INR) prolongation possibly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old white woman with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was admitted for gastrointestinal concerns and found to have an INR &gt;14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was discontinued, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> was administered, and a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> infusion was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the next 2 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon transfer to a tertiary care center, HIT was diagnosed, and a lepirudin infusion was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a sudden elevation of the INR occurred (&gt;14) with low prothrombin (factor II) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After INR values declined to 2-3, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was reinitiated with dosing adjusted using factor X and II activity levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clotting factors II and X activities were measured to monitor long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy, with no evidence of complications after 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Typically, the INR is used to assess the intensity of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The INR value represents the reduction of clotting factors II, VII, and X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In rare circumstances, an independent inhibitor or interfering substance can interfere with the process of measuring the INR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In such situations, an alternative approach can be direct measurement of clotting factor concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Factor II and/or factor X activity levels provided an alternative means for measuring the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effects of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in the presence of a significant inhibitor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>) that biased the INR measurements </plain></SENT>
