<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β2 GPI) constitutes the major autoantigen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), a common acquired cause of arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently described the novel observation that β2 GPI may exist in healthy individuals in a free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> (biochemically reduced) form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to quantify the levels of total, reduced, and posttranslationally modified oxidized β2 GPI in APS patients compared to various control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter analysis, the proportion of β2 GPI with free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> in serum from healthy volunteers was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assays for measurement of reduced as well as total circulating β2 GPI were developed and tested in the following groups: APS (with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) (n=139), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> with or without persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) but without APS (n=188), vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without APS or aPL (n=38), and healthy volunteers (n=91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total β2 GPI was significantly elevated in patients with APS (median 216.2 μg/ml [interquartile range 173.3-263.8]) as compared to healthy subjects (median 178.4 μg/ml [interquartile range 149.4-227.5] [P&lt;0.0002]) or control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> or vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (both P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of total β2 GPI in an oxidized form (i.e., lacking free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi>) was significantly greater in the APS group than in each of the 3 control groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This large retrospective multicenter study shows that posttranslational modification of β2 GPI via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-exchange reactions is a highly specific phenomenon in the setting of APS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantification of posttranslational modifications of β2 GPI in conjunction with standard laboratory tests for APS may offer the potential to more accurately predict the risk of occurrence of a thrombotic event in the setting of APS </plain></SENT>
