<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To validate the current aCL laboratory criterion by verifying the effect of the two cut-offs on APS classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Ninety aCL positive APS patients were selected on the basis of their GPL values above the 99th percentile (17.4 GPL), which was calculated by testing 100 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant difference in the IgG positivity (P &lt; 0.0001) was found between the APS laboratory profiles as 20 out of the 24 (83.3%) patients with single positivity (aCL alone), six out of the 23 (26.1%) with double positivity (aCL plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or anti-beta(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I), and none out of the 43 with triple positivity (aCL plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anti-beta(2)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I) had titers between the 99th percentile and 40 GPL units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the rate of aCL values between the 99th percentile and 40 GPL units was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in patients with pregnancy morbidity (73.7%) as compared to those with vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (16.9%) and those with both conditions (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 99th percentile cut-off level seems more sensitive than the &gt;40 GPL value for APS classification, as it includes subjects with aCL positivity alone as well as patients with pregnancy morbidity </plain></SENT>
