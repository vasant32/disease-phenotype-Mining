<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and a variety of pathologic disorders, such as arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and recurrent pregnancy loss is recognized as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The immunoassay currently used to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> is the anticardiolipin test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies are believed to be polyspecific antibodies that cross-react with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, testing only for anticardiolipin antibodies does not always permit detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, specially when only IgG are evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a selected population of 74 idiopathic and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients, IgG anticardiolipin, antiphosphatidylinositol and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were detected by solid-phase immunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that by testing for each antiphospholipid family, many patients, not evidenced by the standard anticardiolipin assay, were found to be antiphospholipid-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anticardiolipin positive patients have always low, moderate or high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, suggesting that the antiphospholipid positivity is predictive of anticardiolipin positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the patients with only antiphosphatidylinositol positive antibody have a story of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The meaning of these results is at present under discussion </plain></SENT>
