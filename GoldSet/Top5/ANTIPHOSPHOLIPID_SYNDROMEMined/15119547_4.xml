<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had APS and positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> [clinical APS(+)/aPL(+)], 12 patients had APS, negative serum IgG and IgM aCL, antiphosphatidylethanolamine, anti-phosphatidylserine and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> [clinical APS(+)/ aPL(-)] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a fourth group we studied 29 patients without clinical manifestations of APS or aCL [clinical APS(-)/aPL(-)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred anticardiolipin and VDRL-negative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera were studied as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> proper in a bovine beta2GP-free system, to human beta2GP1 immobilized on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> or to human beta2GP1 alone were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sera by ELISA using irradiated and nonirradiated plates from two manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera from APS(+)/aPL(+) patients showed IgG binding to CL, CL + beta2GP1 and beta2GP1 in irradiated and nonirradiated plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APS(+)/ aPL(-) sera had more significant IgG binding to beta2GP1 than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls when studied in both irradiated or nonirradiated plates (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This binding was inhibited by solid-phase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sera from the APS(-)/aPL(+) subgroup had comparable IgG activity in both the CL and CL + beta2GP1 assays, while no anti-beta2GP1 activity was detected in these sera </plain></SENT>
