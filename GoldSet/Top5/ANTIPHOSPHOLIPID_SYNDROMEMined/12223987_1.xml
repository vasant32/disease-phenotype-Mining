<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical charts of 725 patients referred to a central coagulation laboratory during a 12-month period for LA were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data collected included demographic characteristics, the specialty of the referring physicians, the clinical indications for ordering the test, and the influence of the test results on the diagnosis and the treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Special attention was paid to identifying clinical manifestations known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (APLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positive test was defined by abnormal results obtained by at least two techniques from the reagents used and confirmed by a platelet-neutralising procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chi(2) and t-tests were used for independent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients (7.7%) were found to have LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rheumatologists and gynaecologists emerged as the major contributors to this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of LA was significantly associated only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of patients treated with antiaggregants or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> tripled following the test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive dRVVT test strongly correlated with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that LA tests are ordered by a variety of physicians but yield better results when ordered by rheumatologists and gynaecologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> cohort, it was most useful in the investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and suggests a pathogenetic role in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The dRVVT test correlates most closely with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
