<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abundance of this protein in plasma and its high state of preservation indicate the important role of this protein in mammalians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, β2GPI has a particular structure in the fifth domain, and is categorized as the major antigen recognized by autoantibodies present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beta 2 glycoprotein I has been usually studied in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complexes of β2GPI/anti-β2GPI antibodies have been examined in different coagulation and cell activation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the function of β2GPI, independent from the antibodies, has not been clearly determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this paper different features of β2GPI including its structure, plasma concentration and its proposed in vitro and in vivo functions in clot formation and fibrinolysis along with anti-β2GPI antibodies (Abs) are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their inhibitory or promotive effects are delineated in each facet </plain></SENT>
