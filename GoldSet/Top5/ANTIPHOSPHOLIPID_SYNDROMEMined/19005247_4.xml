<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work is to evaluate the genetic and acquired risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were tested for the presence of common polymorphisms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (prothrombin and factor V Leiden) in order to assess genetic risk factors, and several parameters classically associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> (cardiovascular events, brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional assessments of personal and familial history risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> were performed in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> studies did not demonstrate statistically relevant differences between the patients and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e> profile and directed personal and familial histories showed positive trends for SSHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lack of clear relationships between SSHL and other vascular risk factors suggests multicausality as a predominant disease profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although preliminary results point at a vascular involvement in SSHL, a long-term prospective study is necessary to demonstrate that SSHL represents an early vascular symptom </plain></SENT>
