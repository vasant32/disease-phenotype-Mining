<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We analyzed the diagnostic accuracies for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) of 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (APL-Ab) assays targeted at different antigen preparations and immunoglobulin isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 144 patients with suspected APS, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (aCL) and anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2GPI) antibodies were measured with 23 different ELISAs from three manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by ROC curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of an accepted criterion standard, the endpoint "diagnosis of APS" was varied according to the number (two through five) of signs and symptoms of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was associated significantly with APL-Ab in 10 of 23 assays (P = 0.01-10(-4)) and recurrent arterial or venous occlusions were significantly associated with APL-Ab of IgM isotype in 5 of 6 assays (P = 0.02-10(-4)), sensitivity for detection of APS did not exceed 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of IgA APL-Ab, the diagnostic accuracy of the assays improved when the diagnosis of APS was based on an increasing number of simultaneous features of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For most methods, areas under the ROC curves were &gt;0.8 irrespective of the method's subclass specificity and antigen preparation (aCL or abeta2GPI), if the clinical diagnosis of APS was based on four or more signs and symptoms of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the individual test results, a single test of IgG or IgM isotype targeted at either aCL or abeta2GPI antibodies has excellent diagnostic accuracy when the criterion for diagnosis requires four or more typical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
