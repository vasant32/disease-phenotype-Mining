<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM OF STUDY: We investigated to which degree IgG, IgA and IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (aCL) are associated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> or late fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with other signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and in particular SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serological variables typical of SLE and of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome were measured once eight to 16 weeks after the last fetal loss in 158 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> or late fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; women with manifest autoimmune <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Positive values, i.e. above the 99th percentile of reference material, of IgG aCL and IgA aCL were observed in 4% and 7%, respectively, whereas 26% had positive values of IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) IgG aCL and IgA aCL but not IgM aCL correlated to anti-nuclear antibodies and to anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi>, IgG aCL and IgA aCL but not IgM aCL correlated to previous occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(4) ANA correlated to lower blood platelet concentrations and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e> or late fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> who have higher but not necessarily abnormally high levels of IgG aCL or IgA aCL constitute a group with increased occurrence of clinical and serological characteristics of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these women be kept under surveillance for future development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> especially SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The women with high IgM aCL constitute another group without these characteristics </plain></SENT>
