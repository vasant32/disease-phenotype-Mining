<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To ascertain rethrombotic risk factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 95 patients according to their rethrombotic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We registered anticoagulation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) status, comorbidities, traditional thrombotic factors, prevalence of aCL (IgG-IgM), anti-β2GP-I (IgG-IgM), LA and triple marker positivity (LA, aCL and anti-β2GP-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two patients had rethrombosis and 53 were rethrombosis-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 4.5 (0.3-26) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in comorbidities and traditional thrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with rethrombosis had more frequently LA (62% vs. 40%, p=0.04), were younger (41 vs. 47 years, p=0.01) and received less frequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (23% vs. 54%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> status (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.57, p=0.004) and age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98, p=0.01) remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who discontinued <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and developed rethrombosis (Group 1, n=32) vs. patients who discontinued <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, but remained rethrombosis-free (Group 2, n=24) were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a higher prevalence of LA and triple marker positivity in Group 1 (67% vs. 31%; OR= 4.5, 95% CI 1.3-14.9, p= 0.01 and 57% vs. 27%; OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-12; p=0.03), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both variables remained associated with rethrombosis when compared with the overall rethrombosis group vs. Group 2 (LA 62% vs. 31%, OR= 3.6 95% CI 1.1-11.2, p=0.03; triple marker 54% vs. 27%; OR 32 95% CI 1.01-10.2, p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA positivity and triple aPL positivity confer a more severe risk of rethrombosis in PAPS patients, irrespective of their anticoagulation status and known conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
