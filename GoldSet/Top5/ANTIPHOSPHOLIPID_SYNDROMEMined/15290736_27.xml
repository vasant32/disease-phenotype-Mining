<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 404 individuals, classified in 2 groups: (1) patients with primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS, n = 226); and (2) asymptomatic carriers of aPL (n = 178) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were treated with dicumarin, and an international normalized ratio around 3.0 (range 2.5-3.5) was targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic carriers were not treated, but specific prophylaxis with low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or aspirin was prescribed for the periods when individuals were at increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups of individuals were followed up at semester intervals for 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with APS presented with venous (n = 106, 46.9%) and/or arterial (n = 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>31%) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or fetal loss (n = 58 out of 112 women of fertility age, 51.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of the first thrombotic event, 50.0% of patients with APS had coincident risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (previous surgery and prolonged immobilization were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with APS died during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS was linked to insufficient anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the followup, no episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was detected in any asymptomatic carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with aPL was similar in patients and in asymptomatic carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects with aPL decreased during the followup, in both patients and carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differences between patients and asymptomatic carriers with aPL are at least partially dependent on the proportion of coincident vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The decline in aPL during the followup defines a subgroup in which an anticoagulation suppression assay could be tried </plain></SENT>
