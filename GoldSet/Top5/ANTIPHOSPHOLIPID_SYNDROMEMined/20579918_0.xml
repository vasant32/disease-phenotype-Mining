<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define a high obstetrical risk subpopulation of APLS and search predictive criteria of complications likely to improve monitoring of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the CHU of Rouen between 1998 and January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies were included for patients with APLS according to the criteria of Sydney without repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> item </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study involved 20 pregnancies from eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen pregnancies gave birth to living children or 70 %, 28.6 % were complicated with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, 50 % of haemolysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo> low platelets (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HELLP</z:e>) syndrome associated with a 28.6 % stunting and 42 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received treatment involving aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The obstetrical prognosis was significantly poorer in the subgroup with APLS notch bilateral persistent middle of the term of birth of 35.5 versus 28 weeks of gestation, and median birth weight of 950 g versus 2780 g (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patients were selected according to the more specific criteria of APLS (<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss) and a history of severe obstetrical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some series, these complications play a major role; in others, they are unsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rate, in this study, is high (47 %) and the presence of bilateral notch seems to be an excellent predictive marker of vascular complications in this population </plain></SENT>
