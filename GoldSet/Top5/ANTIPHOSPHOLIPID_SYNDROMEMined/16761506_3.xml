<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study is to describe a rare case of APS that occurred in a neonate born from a patient previously diagnosed as primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A male, preterm born twin infant, whose mother had been diagnosed as primary APS, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left subclavian and external jugular veins concomitantly with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> soon after his delivery, that culminated with his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> two months after the birth, in spite of the large spectrum antibiotic therapy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> supportive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings included high titers of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and moderate titers of IgG isotype and negative antinuclear antibody, configuring a case of neonatal APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neonatal APS is a rare clinical condition, with only a few cases described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its occurrence may depend on the passage of antibodies through the placenta or, as it seems to have occurred in the present case, by the production of de novo antibodies by the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present case illustrates the necessity of a higher surveillance of the neonates born from mothers with primary APS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) for the eventual development of such complication </plain></SENT>
