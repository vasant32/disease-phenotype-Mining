<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-17-inducing cytokines IL-23 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, as well as IL-17 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2275913 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied fifty patients with PAPS and fifty age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cytokine levels were measured by ELISA, while the rs2275913 SNP located in promoter region of IL-17 gene was genotyped using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significantly higher levels of IL-17 (p=0.002), IL-23 (p&lt;0.001) and TGF-β (p=0.042) were found in PAPS patients (median 13.1, 9.4, and 125.6 pg/ml, respectively) compared to the control group (6.8, 4.9 and 44.4 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive correlation between concentrations of IL-17 and IL-23 (r=0.540, p&lt;0.001), but not between those of IL-17 and TGF-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the IL-17 rs2275913 variants in patients with PAPS compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood concentrations of IL-17 did not differ in subjects with different rs2275913 genotypes or patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, a trend toward higher IL-17 levels (p=0.063) and the significantly higher IL-17 concentrations (p=0.012) were observed in PAPS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that IL-23/IL-17 axis, stimulated independently of TGF-β increase IL-17A gene polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production, might contribute to vascular manifestations of PAPS </plain></SENT>
