<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is unclear; there are several theories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that a pathogenic interaction exists between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and platelets, leading to their activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the expression of the platelet activation markers CD62 and CD63 by flow cytometry in 20 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of soluble P-selectin were also assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reticulated platelets were measured as an indicator of increased platelet production and/or turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median CD63 expression was significantly increased in patients (14.3%) compared to a group of healthy controls (10.1%, P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in median CD62 expression or percent reticulated platelets between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median level of soluble P-selectin was significantly higher in PAPS patients (35.5 ng/ml) compared to controls (18.8 ng/ml, P = 0.0028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving aspirin had lower median CD63 values (13.1%) when compared to those patients who were not (18.0%, P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, aspirin therapy did not prevent significant platelet activation occurring in some individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that although not excessive, there is a degree of increased platelet activation in some PAPS patients, which is not always suppressed by antiplatelet therapy with aspirin </plain></SENT>
