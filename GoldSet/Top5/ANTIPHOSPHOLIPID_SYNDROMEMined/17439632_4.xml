<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) binds protein C and enhances its activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR autoantibodies are found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> and may explain the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR autoantibodies have been associated with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in young women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether anti-EPCR autoantibodies are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: We measured plasma anti-EPCR autoantibody levels in the Leiden <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> Study (LETS), a population-based case-control study consisting of 474 patients with a first DVT and 474 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated risk of DVT was increased approximately 2-fold in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003261'>elevated IgA</z:hpo>, IgG or IgM anti-EPCR autoantibodies (i.e. levels above the 90th percentile as measured in the control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk conferred by anti-EPCR increased in a dose-dependent manner for IgA and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When anti-EPCR autoantibodies were considered in the co-presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) the odds ratio (OR) was 6.1 [95% CI 1.3-27.9] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR without LAC remained associated with DVT (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-EPCR autoantibodies were associated with high levels of D-dimer and soluble EPCR in controls, suggestive of a prothrombotic status induced by the autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the presence of anti-EPCR autoantibodies is a moderate risk factor for DVT in the general population </plain></SENT>
