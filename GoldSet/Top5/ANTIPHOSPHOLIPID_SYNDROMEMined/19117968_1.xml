<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> further increases this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: We analyzed a large group of 400 Czech women with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in association with oral contraceptive with regard to duration of use at the time of manifestation of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, the frequency of inherited and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, the frequency of eliciting risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> including immobilization, surgery, administration of plaster cast, long travel, and so on, and the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the women was 26 years, and the average duration of use was 45 months at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> solely due to the pill occurred in 57% of the women, and in the other 43%, an additional transient eliciting factor was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the clinical manifestation, distal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prevailed (N = 231, 58%) followed by proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (N = 65, 16%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (N = 21, 5%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in unusual sites (N = 20, 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inherited or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 195 (49%) women: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> in 35%, congenital deficiency of antithrombin in 1.8%, protein C in 0.8%, protein S in 1%, F IIG20210A in 5%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in 5.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the most common risk factors were immobilization of lower limb, minor and major surgery, and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The results confirm that venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is a multifactorial disease in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> screening is needed in young symptomatic women on the pill with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results also emphasize the value of proper thromboprophylaxis in women while on oral contraceptive in situations of increased risk for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
