<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from 98 UT were compared to those of (I) 142 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>: 67 antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and 75 hereditary hemostatic defects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e>); (II) 110 patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>: 60 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and 50 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> (ID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As compared to controls (100 blood donors), aPE prevalence was significantly higher in both autoimmune contexts (APS: 43%; SLE: 40%, p&lt;0.0001) and among non-autoimmune pathologies, only in UT (18%, p = 0.001) conversely to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HHD</z:e> (8%) or ID (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>aPE prevalence in UT was not statistically different from that found in Primary APS (32%, p = 0.076) but lower than in Secondary APS (65%, p &lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In UT, aPE were mainly of IgM isotype like in Primary APS and they were found alone whereas in SLE they were always associated with classical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between any isotype of aPE and a site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in UT as well as in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study demonstrates an increase of the prevalence of aPE in patients with unexplained <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, aPE investigation appears to be of interest in UT and their persistent presence could define a biological variant of APS </plain></SENT>
