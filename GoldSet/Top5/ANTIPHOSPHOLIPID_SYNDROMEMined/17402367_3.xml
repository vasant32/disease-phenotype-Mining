<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL), but not anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, might have a role through direct placental damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We cultured human placental explants in sera from women with SLE/PAPS with different antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These sera were found to reduce placental growth and increase trophoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No effect was found on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> secretion, but inhibition in betahCG secretion was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BetahCG was reduced in women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, and was also the most sensitive marker when examining the effects of specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High titers of aPL were found to cause the largest reduction in betahCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-Ro and anti-La did not induce placental damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was found between the rise in the number of different antibodies in the sera and the incidence of recurrent pregnancy loss, which was also accompanied by a decline in the betahCG levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aPL, but not anti-Ro or anti-La, may cause placental damage in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus betahCG levels might constitute a predictive marker for the risk of placental damage and pregnancy loss in women with SLE/PAPS </plain></SENT>
