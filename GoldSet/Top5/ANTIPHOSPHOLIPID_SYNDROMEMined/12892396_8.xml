<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of naked DNA encoding TNFalpha resulted in the generation of immunological memory to its gene product, associated with elevated circulating anti-TNFalpha antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enriched IgG fraction of the mouse anti-TNFalpha was biologically active since it prevented endothelial cell activation by TNFalpha e.g., inhibition of monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to activated endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice immunized with beta2GPI, vaccinated with TNFalpha DNA at an early stage of disease development, showed decreased titres of circulating anti-beta2GPI antibodies as compared to the group of mice vaccinated with a control naked DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> production was followed by amelioration of the foetal loss, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>increased platelet count</z:hpo> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values as well as normalization of the prolonged aPTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS mice which were introduced to the TNFalpha DNA vector at a later stage of the disease development, showed less improvement in their clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current study suggests a way in which a DNA vaccine can be employed for induction of a protective immunity in experimental APS </plain></SENT>
