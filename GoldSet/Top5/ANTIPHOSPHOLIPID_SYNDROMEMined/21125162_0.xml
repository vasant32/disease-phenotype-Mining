<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a transversal study with 58 patients (82.8% females) with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, medications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty (34.5%) out of 58 patients were positive for ANA Hep-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing the group of patients ANA Hep-2+ with those that were ANA Hep-2-, it was observed that both groups of patients with APS did not show statistically significant differences regarding demographic data, as well as the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As for clinical and laboratorial manifestations, the ANA Hep-2+ group showed higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (85 versus 52.6%, P = 0.04), a statistically higher frequency of anticardiolipin IgG (85 versus 52.6%, P = 0.02), and a tendency for anticardiolipin IgM (80% versus 52.6%, P = 0.05), as well as greater medians of those antibodies [33 (0-128) versus 20 (0-120) GPL, P = 0.008] and [33 (0-120) versus 18,5 (0-120) MPL, P = 0.009] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such difference was not observed regarding other manifestations of APS, presence of comorbidities, lifestyle, and medications used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAPS with ANA Hep-2+ have a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM </plain></SENT>
