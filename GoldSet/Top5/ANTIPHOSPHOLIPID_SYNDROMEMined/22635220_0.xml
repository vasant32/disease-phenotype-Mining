<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from these patients contained high levels of IgG antibodies against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, IgG and IgM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi>, IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18303">phosphatidyl L-serine</z:chebi>, and IgG against anti-annexin V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conventional treatment of APS was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) showed chromosomally impaired embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course of pregnancies and deliveries were monitored due to the close collaboration of in vitro fertilization and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> in early embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the selection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> embryos using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>, and the treatment of APS, both patients became pregnant and delivered healthy babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Without such selection, both women would probably have miscarried their embryos again </plain></SENT>
