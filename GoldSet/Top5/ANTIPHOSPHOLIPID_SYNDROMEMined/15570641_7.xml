<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 5-year followup study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1995 and 1997, 29 consecutive patients with primary APS were studied by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were evaluated in our institution and 5 were referred from elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had died, 12 patients had the 5-year followup TEE, and 8 failed to report for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first TEE, valve lesions were found in 17 patients (70.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in 5 cases (29.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> in 4 (23.5%), and a calcified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the right atrium in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five-year followup TEE was performed in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Valve lesions were unchanged in 3 cases, and in one of them a new apical akinesis of the left ventricle appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New valve lesions were detected in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients, the valve lesions had progressed and in 2, abnormalities of ventricular wall motion had appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this highly selected population of patients with primary APS, the predominant cardiac lesion was a noninfective valve lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment and aspirin proved ineffective in terms of valvular lesion regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Altogether, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in 9 (37.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had coronary angiography and coronary arteries were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 6 </plain></SENT>
