<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite treatment, however, these pregnancies are frequently complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, fetal growth restriction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental insufficiency</z:mp>, often with the result of preterm birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Small case series suggest that intravenous immune globulin may reduce the rates of these obstetric complications, but the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of a multicenter trial of intravenous immune globulin and to assess the impact on obstetric and neonatal outcomes among women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> of the addition of intravenous immune globulin to a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind pilot study compared treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin plus intravenous immune globulin with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin plus placebo in a group of women who met strict criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, medium to high levels of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a single live intrauterine fetus at &lt;/=12 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous immune globulin (1 g/kg body weight) or an identical-appearing placebo for 2 consecutive days each month until 36 weeks' gestation in addition to a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal characteristics, obstetric complications, and neonatal outcomes were compared with the Student t test and the Fisher exact test as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen women were enrolled during a 2-year period; 7 received intravenous immune globulin and 9 were given placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, number of previous pregnancy losses, and gestational age at the initiation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Obstetric outcomes were excellent in both groups, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women being delivered of live-born infants after 32 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rates of antepartum complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>, fetal growth restriction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006372'>placental insufficiency</z:mp> (as manifested by fetal growth restriction or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e>) were similar between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gestational age at delivery (intravenous immune globulin group, 34.6 +/- 1.1 weeks; placebo group, 36.7 +/- 2.1 weeks) and birth weights (intravenous immune globulin group, 2249.7 +/- 186.1 g; placebo group; 2604.4 +/- 868.9 g) were similar between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were fewer cases of fetal growth restriction (intravenous immune globulin group, 0%; placebo group, 33%) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (intravenous immune globulin group, 20%; placebo group, 44%) among the infants in the intravenous immune globulin group than those in the placebo group, but these differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A multicenter treatment trial of intravenous immune globulin is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study intravenous immune globulin did not improve obstetric or neonatal outcomes beyond those achieved with a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although not statistically significant, the findings of fewer cases of fetal growth restriction and neonatal intensive care unit admissions among the intravenous immune globulin-treated pregnancies may warrant expansion of the study </plain></SENT>
