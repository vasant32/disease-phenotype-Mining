<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and immunological characteristics of a series of patients with AMA M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 71 patients with AMA M5 seen consecutively at our centres during the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and immunological characteristics of diseases expression were compared with 70 consecutive disease control patients without AMA M5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, AMA M5 positive patients presented higher prevalence of false positive VDRL test (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.002) with lower levels of anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AMA M5 patients (56 female, 15 male) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of disorders were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (38%) patients fulfilled the Sapporo criteria for the classification of the APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory criteria were met in 55 (77.5%), and clinical criteria in 31 (43.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients initially presented with non-criteria features of APS during follow-up period developed APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger patients with AMA M5 should be carefully observed for the development of APS, even in the absence of serological criteria, while elderly must be screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
