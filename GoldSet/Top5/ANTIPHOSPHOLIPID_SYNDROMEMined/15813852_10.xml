<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of IgG preparations containing anti-prothrombin antibodies of 17 lupus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive patients and 12 controls on the inactivation of factor Va (FVa) by activated protein C (APC) in a system with purified coagulation factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Test IgG was incubated with human prothrombin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> vesicles and CaCl(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein S, FVa and APC were added and the APC-dependent loss of FVa activity was monitored over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The residual amount of FVa remaining after 10 min was 14 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) when 1.5 mg/ml <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG was present and ranged between 17% and 82% with 1.5 mg/ml patient IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients IgG gave values of residual FVa &gt;22% (i.e. 2 SD above the mean of controls), indicating that APC-mediated inactivation of FVa was significantly inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition was strictly dependent on the presence of prothrombin, proportional to the concentration of IgG and strongly diminished at a 20-fold higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most, although not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, IgG containing anti-prothrombin antibodies inhibit the APC-catalysed FVa inactivation, which may contribute to the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome </plain></SENT>
