<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the number and sequence of preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent miscarriage</z:e> (RM) clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Women who attended the RM clinic from 1988 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Number, type, and sequence of previous pregnancies were compared between women with APS and women with unexplained RM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): A total of 1,719 patients were included; 312 (18%) had APS, and 1,407 (82%) had unexplained RM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean maternal age (32.6 years) did not differ between women with and without APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> was three in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 865 women (50%) had a history of at least one live birth, with no difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both groups, 97% of the women had a history of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): The number of preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, type and sequence of previous pregnancies, and maternal age were not associated with APS in women with RM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no increased diagnostic yield for APS after three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> rather than after two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and no increased diagnostic yield for APS after consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> rather than after nonconsecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, APS testing should be considered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women with two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
