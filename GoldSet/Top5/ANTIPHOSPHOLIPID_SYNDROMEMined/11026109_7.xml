<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of aANX IgG-positive results in the autoimmune APS group was significantly higher than that of healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we could not demonstrate a significantly higher incidence in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>- or drug-induced group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nor could we find an increased incidence of IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the 2 plates were compared, the discrepancies of positivity were demonstrated in both isotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculated that these discrepancies between the plate surfaces were attributed to the altered antigenicity of ANX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although positivity of a-beta 2GPI was associated significantly with clinical manifestations, no significant associations were demonstrated between the incidence of aANX-positive results and clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We inferred that the involvement of aANX in the pathogenic mechanism of APS is unlikely </plain></SENT>
