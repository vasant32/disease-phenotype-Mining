<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-GPI antibodies isolated from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were used to screen <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> libraries expressed in phage, resulting in the identification of a phage that specifically bound anti-beta2-GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phage-displayed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was identified and chemically optimized to generate a synthetic 14-mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with an internal thioether linkage (LJP 685) that retained the binding profile of the original phage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LJP 685 was conjugated to a defined, non-immunogenic organic platform to generate a tetravalent presentation of LJP 685 for use as a toleragen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tetravalent LJP 685 induced a dose-dependent reduction in antibody levels in mice previously immunized and boosted with LJP 685 coupled to the carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments support the technical feasibility of a tolerance-based approach for reducing anti-beta2-GPI antibodies in vivo </plain></SENT>
