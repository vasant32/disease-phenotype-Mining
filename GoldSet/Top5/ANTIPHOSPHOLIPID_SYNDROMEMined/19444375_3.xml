<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report experience on the use of self-closing nitinol U-Clips for different types of intracranial arterial microanastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We treated 7 patients (3 females and 4 males, age ranging from 25 to 68 yo) admitted from November 2005 to January 2008 to the Neurological Institute C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besta of Milan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and the others a complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient a bypass procedure was completed by using self-closing Nitinol U-Clips for intracranial arterial microanastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total time of temporary occlusion was 15.71 +/- 4.386 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bypass patency was confirmed intraoperatively by near-infrared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> videoangiography and microdoppler in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No spasm of the graft was encountered and immediate post-operative bypass patency was confirmed in 6/7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The graft thrombosed in 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>1 patient died from a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> while waiting for an endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 5 patients at the last follow-up, long-term patency of the bypass was confirmed and no neurological deficits occurred related to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the use of U-Clips for intracranial microanastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that it is a safe technique, reduces the time taken to perform an anastomosis and the risk of an ischemic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the longer-term patency of bypass as performed with U-Clips are required </plain></SENT>
