<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The determination of various A-CL isotypes may be used to predict thromboses in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall 210 patients (185 women and 25 men) with a verified diagnosis of SLE were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were not screened in accordance with some or other clinical signs of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 100 healthy subjects (donors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes of A-CL were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sera of SLE patients showed an increase of the concentration of A-CL of both certain isotypes and their potential combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among A-CL-positive patients, the IgG isotype of A-CL was detected in 75% of cases, the IgM isotype of A-CL in 61%, and the IgA isotype of A-CL in 36% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic complications were recorded in 19% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were induced by hyperproduction of the three combinations of the A-CL isotypes: A-CL IgM, IgM+IgA, and IgG+IgA+IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients whose sera contained A-CL of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types at a time were most prone to thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has turned out that the percentage of SLE patients with thromboses was higher than that of SLE patients without thromboses, starting from the definite A-CL concentration (21 GPL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
