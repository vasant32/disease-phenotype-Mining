<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) remain unknown, though several hypotheses in regard to hypofibrinolysis have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the mechanism, we measured plasma levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the TAFI antigen (TAFI:Ag) level measured with an ELISA, and thrombin-thrombomodulin-dependent TAFI activity (TAFI:Ac) were elevated in 68 APS patients as compared with those in 66 healthy controls, though they were lower than those in 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As for the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) on TAFI levels, the mean TAFI:Ac level in 39 SLE patients positive for APS was significantly lower than that in 27 SLE patients without APS, whereas there was no difference in TAFI:Ag between those groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, purified IgG from patients positive for aPL, and monoclonal aPL (EY2C9 and 23-1D) inhibited the activation of TAFI in a concentration dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that aPL inhibits TAFI activation by affecting the function of thrombomodulin-thrombin complex through <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although TAFI in plasma is elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> including APS, we concluded that an elevated level is not likely a risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS patients, because of the inhibition of TAFI activation by aPL </plain></SENT>
