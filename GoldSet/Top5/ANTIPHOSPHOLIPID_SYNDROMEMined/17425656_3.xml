<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reduced fibrinolytic activity has been described in primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (PAPS), and may be responsible for thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) or plasminogen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi>) might contribute to the hypofibrinolytic state in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, but the clinical significance of these antibodies is still unclear in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> and anti-t-PA antibodies in 87 patients with a history of RPL: 54 women with well-defined PAPS (mean age 32.5 years; range 26-38) and 33 women with unexplained RPL (mean age 30 years; range 24-39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies were found in 20 and four patients from the group with RPL/PAPS and unexplained RPL, respectively; IgG anti-t-PA antibodies were found in 11 and two patients from the above two groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies were associated with the high risk of RPL (OR 7.2, P = 0.004), especially with RPL/PAPS (OR 11.2, P &lt; 0.001) evaluated by Fisher's exact test, while IgG anti-t-PA were associated with RPL/PAPS (OR 10.0, P = 0.01) but not with RPL (OR 6.8, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant inhibition of exogenous fibrinolysis was observed by IgG fractions from patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> or anti-t-PA antibodies on microplates and on the human umbilical vein endothelial cells, compared with those from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IgG anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi> antibodies was high in RPL patients, especially in RPL/PAPS, while the prevalence of IgG anti-t-PA antibodies was high in RPL/PAPS but not in RPL, and some of them might inhibit fibrinolysis in patients </plain></SENT>
