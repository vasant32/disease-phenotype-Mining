<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several cellular receptors have been proposed to mediate these effects, but no convincing evidence for the involvement of a specific one has been provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E receptor 2 (ApoER2') on the pathogenic effects of a patient-derived polyclonal aPL IgG preparation (IgG-APS), a murine anti-β(2)GPI monoclonal antibody (E7) and of a constructed dimeric β(2)GPI I (dimer), which in vitro mimics β(2)GPI-antibody immune complexes, using an animal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and ApoER2-deficient (-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice, IgG-APS, E7 and the dimer increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, carotid artery TF activity as well as peritoneal macrophage TF activity/expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those pathogenic effects were significantly reduced in ApoER2 (-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, those effects induced by the IgG-APS, by E7 and by the dimer were inhibited by treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice with soluble binding domain 1 of ApoER2 (sBD1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether these data show that ApoER2 is involved in pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipids antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
