<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and laboratory features, as well as the precipitating factors, treatment and outcome of patients with catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the 280 patients included until September 2008 in the website based international registry of patients with catastrophic APS ("CAPS Registry") (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The entire series includes 201 (72%) female and 79 (28%) male patients with a mean age of 37 +/- 14 years (range, 11-60 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 129 (46%) patients suffered from primary APS, 112 (40%) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 14 (5%) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease, and 25 (9%) from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The catastrophic episode was the first manifestation of the APS in 129 (46%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A precipitating factor was reported in 53% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first clinical manifestation at the time of the catastrophic episode was a pulmonary complication in 24% of the cases, a neurologic feature in 18% and a renal feature in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the catastrophic episode, intraabdominal involvement was identified in the majority of patients, mainly consisting of renal (71%), hepatic (33%), gastrointestinal (25%), splenic (19%), adrenal (13%), and pancreatic (8%) manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>123 (44%) patients died at the time of the catastrophic APS event but the higher recovery rate was achieved by the combination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> plus plasma exchange (PE) and/or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (69% versus 54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The catastrophic APS is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition that needs high clinical awareness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The therapeutical connotation is that this may be corrected with the combination of anticoagulation plus steroids plus attempts at achieving a prompt reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> titer (i.e. PE and/or IVIG) </plain></SENT>
