<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH), specifically dalteparin, to unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (UFH) for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APS) in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a tertiary referral centre, 28 women met the 1999 International Consensus Criteria for APS, based on their obstetrical history and APS serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The women were randomized, using a random numbers table with blocks of 12, to receive either prophylactic dosing of dalteparin or UFH starting either preconceptionally or early in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women also received low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, started preconceptionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes were maternal and fetal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 women who received the LMWH, dalteparin, and the 14 women who received UFH, 1 woman in each group did not conceive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 13 women (69%) given dalteparin had a successful pregnancy (95% confidence interval [CI], 39-91%), compared to 4 out of the 13 women (31%) in the UFH group (95% CI, 9-61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine women in total had spinal or epidural anaesthesia, and there were no complications overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dalteparin may be an effective alternative to UFH for treatment of APS in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multicentre randomized trial is needed to determine benefit-to-risk ratios for the use of dalteparin and UFH to treat this high-risk obstetrical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are also recommended to maximize therapeutic response and minimize toxicity </plain></SENT>
