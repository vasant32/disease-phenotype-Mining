<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for anti-beta(2)-GPI in Thai <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients with clinical features of APS and compared the results with IgG/IgM aCL and LAC to find the test with the best association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hospital records of 151 Thai SLE patients whose sera had been sent for either IgG/IgM anticardiolipin antibodies or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> testing were reviewed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the remaining subjects (112 patients), their sera were tested for anti-beta(2)-GPI antibody, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 112 (74.2%) SLE patients in the study, 35 (31.3%) presented with preliminary clinical criteria for APS (i.e., vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and pregnancy morbidity) whereas 77 (68.7%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of anti-beta(2)-GPI determination were 57.1 and 79.2%, respectively, whereas those of IgG aCL were 25.7 and 94.8%, of IgM aCL were 5.7 and 98.7%, and of LAC were 44.8 and 77.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of the four tests showed similar association with clinical APS (accuracy of test = 72.3, 73.2, 69.6, and 68.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concerning the sensitivity, specificity, and difficulty of the methods, the combination of anti-beta(2)-GPI and IgG aCL tests was the best for the diagnosis of APS in Thai SLE patients </plain></SENT>
