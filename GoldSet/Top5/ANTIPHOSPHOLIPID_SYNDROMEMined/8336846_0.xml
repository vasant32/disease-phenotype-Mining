<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mentioned autoantibodies are directed against the negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> of the clotting cascade and can be detected by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent prolongation of some coagulation tests "in vitro" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite these results "in vitro", patients suffering from this syndrome present a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e>, of which these antibodies seem to be the "marker" or intimately connected in some way with the highly complex coagulation mechanisms resulting in thrombotic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> also showed the typical manifestations of some other symptoms such as neurological and ocular diseases and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with severe ventricular dysfunction, which could not be ascribed to any detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This made our case original and much more interesting and induced us to make clear its "expanded" clinical manifestations that, as recently reported in literature, may now be included under the broad umbrella of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
