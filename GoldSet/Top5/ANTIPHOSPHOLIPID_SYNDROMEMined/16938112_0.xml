<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: Fifteen cases positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, who had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> in which an extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> infant (&lt;1000 g) was born as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth restriction</z:hpo> with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341950,C0156669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">severe preeclampsia</z:e>, were treated with the medication according to the current protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four cases with the same condition, who were treated with only low-dose aspirin, or without medication, were chosen as a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy outcome was compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of patients in whom the next pregnancy continued until the 36th week of gestation or later was significantly higher in treated patients (80.0%) compared with the control population (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, we obtained case report data that Sairei-to may provide some benefit for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1659749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reproductive disorders</z:e> positive for anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies; however, randomized controlled trial evidence is needed before current treatment can be recommended </plain></SENT>
