<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with occupational exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamides</z:chebi> were evaluated clinically and biochemically/immunologically for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and signs and immuno-reactivity were monitored during exposure-free and re-exposure as part of the individuals' clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six individuals with occupational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28619">acrylamide</z:chebi> exposure had clinical and laboratory alterations characteristic of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, specifically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Sjogren's</z:e> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the full spectrum of disease in the reported patients to that found with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> strongly suggests the effects of occupational exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This uncontrolled study suggests the need for a full epidemiologic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals working with such occupational exposure, including full clinical and immunological examination </plain></SENT>
