<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate potential platelet ligands of beta2GPI, platelet membrane proteins from healthy persons and patients with APS were passed through a beta2GPI-affinity column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using mass spectrometry, platelet factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) appeared as the dominant beta2GPI binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> could bind in vitro, with high-affinity, recombinant beta2GPI, and the binding was abrogated by soluble beta2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coprecipitation experiments further confirmed this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In silico molecular docking showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> tetramers can bind 2 beta2GPI molecules simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Size exclusion chromatography confirmed that anti-beta2GPI antibodies selectively interact with complexes composed of (beta2GPI)(2)-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>)(4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, as shown by the beta2GPI antigenicity evaluation, the reactivity of APS sera was higher against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>-beta2GPI complex than against beta2GPI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On complex formation, anti-beta2GPI-beta2GPI-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> significantly induced platelet p38MAPK phosphorylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> production, mainly through F(ab')(2) fragments of antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study makes evident that beta2GPI forms stable complexes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>, leading to the stabilization of beta2GPI dimeric structure that facilitates the antibody recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This interaction can probably be involved in the procoagulant tendency of APS </plain></SENT>
