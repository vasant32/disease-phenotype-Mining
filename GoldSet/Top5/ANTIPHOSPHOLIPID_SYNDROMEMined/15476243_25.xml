<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies (AECAs) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> are involved in the initial endothelial cell (EC) membrane perturbation effect that is postulated to provide a target for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> (aPL) binding and, hence, to trigger the thrombotic cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the AECA antigenic target on ECs and to determine the mechanism whereby the EC membrane is disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: AECAs from SLE patients were assayed for binding to ECs by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive AECAs were assayed by immunoblotting, and a consensus antigen was identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This candidate antigen was tested in recombinant form for AECA recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AECAs were affinity-purified on this antigen and incubated with ECs to determine their physiologic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-Hsp60 antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship of anti-Hsp60 status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) status to thrombotic manifestations between disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the last followup visit were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the SLE sera (73%) possessed IgG that bound to the surface of ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These positive IgG shared reactivity against a 60-kd EC surface <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that was identified as human Hsp60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of Hsp60 at the EC surface was established using anti-Hsp60 antibodies from commercial sources or affinity-purified from SLE sera that bound ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incubation of ECs with these anti-Hsp60 antibodies induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by Hoechst 33342 dye staining of condensed nuclei and by annexin V binding to surface phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anti-Hsp60 antibodies were not restricted to SLE patients, but were found in patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, anti-Hsp60 antibodies were significantly associated with an increased frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> when present in combination with LAC in the SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of Hsp60 at the surface of ECs serves as a target for the anti-Hsp60 antibodies in SLE sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These anti-Hsp60 antibodies bind to ECs and induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, particularly phosphatidylserine exposure, thus providing a target for the binding of aPL and inducing the subsequent thrombotic cascade </plain></SENT>
