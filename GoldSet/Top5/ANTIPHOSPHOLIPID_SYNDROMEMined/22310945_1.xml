<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the frequencies of polymorphic alleles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in women with idiopathic FGR, (ii) to analyze the maternal and cord blood levels of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCPs</z:e>, and (iii) to identify the gene environment interaction that increases the risk of FGR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and cord blood samples of 50 FGR cases (birth weight &lt;10 percentile for gestational age as per Lubchenco's growth chart) and equal number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies who were occupationally non exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCPs</z:e> and excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the known high risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, medical disease, dietary habit, living style, parity, and BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The collected samples at the time of delivery/after delivery were analyzed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCPs</z:e> levels by gas chromatography and polymorphic analysis for GSTM1/GSTT1 gene using multiplex PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of α,β,γ-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16130">p,p'-DDT</z:chebi> were found in maternal blood and significantly higher levels of β and γ-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16130">p,p'-DDT</z:chebi> were found in cord blood of FGR cases as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotypic distribution of GSTM1/GSTT1 was almost similar in both the groups, but the frequency of GSTM1-/GSTT1- (null) genotype was significantly higher in FGR cases as compared to controls (p&lt;0.05, OR=6.42) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCPs</z:e> in pregnant women may be considered as an important aetiological factor in 'idiopathic' FGR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study provides evidence that polymorphism in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> metabolising genes may modify the effect of environmental health hazards and increase the risk of FGR </plain></SENT>
