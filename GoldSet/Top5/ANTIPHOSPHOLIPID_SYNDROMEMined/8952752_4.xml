<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a retrospective analysis, it has been suggested that patients with APS should be kept on prolonged anticoagulation aiming at international normalised ratio (INR) values &gt; 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether the requirement for more intense anticoagulation depends on the variable sensitivity of thromboplastin reagents to the influence of aPLA, we monitored oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in 10 patients with persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LA) and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> using two thromboplastin reagents: Pro-IL-Complex (Instrumentation Laboratory, combined) and Recombiplastin (Ortho, recombinant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53766,53768,53769">Acenocoumarol</z:chebi> dosage was always assigned based on INR values obtained with the combined thromboplastin using diluted (1:20) test plasma, aiming at an INR interval of 2.0 to 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single INR determinations with both reagents were obtained throughout the study period for 110 aPLA-free patients on stable oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the manufacturer's instrument-certified international sensitivity index (ISI) values, INR obtained with the recombinant reagent were significantly higher than those obtained with the combined reagent in LA-positive patients, but they were lower in LA-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After correction for local ISI calibration in LA-negative patients, INR values of 3.1 and 4.6 with Recombiplastin corresponded, respectively, to INR values of 2.0 and 3.0 with Pro-IL-Complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the thromboplastin-dependency of INR values in patients with LA, thereby questioning the validity of the INR system for the monitoring of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in these patients </plain></SENT>
