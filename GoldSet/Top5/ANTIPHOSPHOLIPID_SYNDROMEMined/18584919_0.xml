<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of appropriate randomised controlled trials, data of retrospective cohort studies were used to establish these strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the results of recent clinical trials, what they add to patient management and the issues that remain unsolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SECONDARY PROPHYLAXIS OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS: While there is a consensus for prolonged <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> anticoagulation after a first event, two recent randomised clinical trials have compared various intensities of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both studies have shown that high intensities of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were not superior to conventional intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients included in these studies had mainly venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There has been no study comparing different antithrombotic strategies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The WARSS/APASS study, in particular has not been conducted in patients with definite APS and should not be applied to these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For now, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> should remain the treatment of choice in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS: Because of the high incidence of thrombotic events in asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, a clinical trial compared aspirin and placebo in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study did not demonstrate any benefit of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that recent clinical trials indicate the optimal antithrombotic strategy in APS with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the best options for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and for primary prophylaxis remain to be established by further studies </plain></SENT>
