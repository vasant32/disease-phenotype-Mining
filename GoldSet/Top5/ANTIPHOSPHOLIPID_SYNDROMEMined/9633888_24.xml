<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied 115 patients (85 men, mean age 36.9 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and treated by alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid determinations comprised anticardiolipin (ACA), anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and anti-prothrombin antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At entry, 24 patients (21%) were found to possess low to moderate ACA levels (18 IgG, two IgM and four both isotypes) compared with only 4/115 age- and sex-matched control subjects (3.5% P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACA positivity rate increased to 31% (P=0.01) after a 6-month course of alpha-IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the prevalence of anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I and anti-prothrombin antibodies was not significantly different from controls at either time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of ACA correlated with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (P=0.0002), but was not associated with parameters such as histological activity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> burden and response to alpha-IFN, nor with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a non-significant trend of higher incidence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> among ACA-positive patients was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low-titre ACA positivity is a common finding in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C, especially following alpha-IFN treatment, but does not select a category with different clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data are in keeping with the absence of associated anti-beta2GPI and anti-prothrombin antibodies, and do not support a role for HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the pathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
