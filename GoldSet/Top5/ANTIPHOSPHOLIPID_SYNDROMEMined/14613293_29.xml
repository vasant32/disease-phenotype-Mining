<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies have also been shown to enhance the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes to endothelial cells (ECs) in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New lipophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> have antiinflammatory and antithrombogenic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study uses an in vivo mouse model to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> has an effect on decreasing both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes to ECs and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation induced by aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of CD-1 male mice, each comprising approximately 18 mice, were fed either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline solution or 15 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the 2 groups was further subdivided to receive either purified IgG from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IgG from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dynamics was performed in treated and control mice, using a standardized thrombogenic injury procedure, and the area (size) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes to ECs was analyzed with a microcirculation model of exposed cremaster muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline and posttreatment soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (sICAM-1) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IgG-APS mice treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> showed significantly smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, a reduced number of adherent leukocytes, and decreased levels of sICAM-1 compared with IgG-APS animals treated with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38561,38562">fluvastatin</z:chebi> significantly diminishes aPL-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and EC activation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results may have important implications for the design of new treatment strategies aimed at preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
