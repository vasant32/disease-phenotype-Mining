<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>aPL include anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> Ab (aCL) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (LAC, detected as Ig that prolong certain in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL)-restricted blood clotting tests); both aCL and LAC are the diagnostic Ab for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies show that aPL represent a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of Ab, which recognize various PL, PL-binding plasma proteins, and/or PL-protein complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that five of seven patient-derived IgG monoclonal aCL react with thrombin, activated protein C, and plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three proteins are trypsin-like serine proteases (SP), and are highly homologous in their catalytic domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, among these SP autoantigens, the reactive aCL bind to plasmin with the highest affinity, suggesting that plasmin may serve as a major driving autoantigen for some aCL in approximately 30% of APS patients who are positive for IgG anti-plasmin Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we immunized BALB/c mice with human plasmin and analyzed immune sera for aCL activity and reactivity with relevant SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that some immune sera displayed aCL activity and/or bound to test SP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, eight mAb were obtained and studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that one mAb displayed the aCL and the LAC activities and induced fetal loss when injected into pregnant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analyses of placentas revealed extensive deposits of activated C3 components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combined, these data demonstrate that plasmin may serve as a driving Ag for some pathogenic aPL </plain></SENT>
