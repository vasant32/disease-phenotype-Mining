<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 369 patients, including 293 with SLE, 160 with secondary APS, 76 with PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients aged 14 to 63 years (mean 31.9+/-10.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The history of disease was 0.6 to 30 years (mean 9.1+/-7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them 32 (8.7%) patients with aseptic necroses of different bones were selected in accordance with the data of X-ray studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ON was detected in 8.7 patients with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The X-ray signs corresponded to third-to-sixth-degree ON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common site of ON was the head of the femur, although another site of ON was observed and multiple ON was typical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo>, creatininemia, fibrinogen levels were associated with ON (p &lt; 0.05 by the Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activity of SLE was significantly associated with SLEDAI scale scores (p &lt; 0.05 by the Wald-Wolfovitz test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients with SLE and ON had high scores by this scale--more than 40 scores of the maximum 150 possible scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>APS was diagnosed in 87.5 of the patients with ON (28 of the 32 patients) and only in 61.7% of the patients without ON (in 208 of the 337 patients) (chi2 = 8.4; p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The development of ON in the examinees was significantly associated with the presence of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The activity of SLE, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, positive tests for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, the presence of arterial thromboses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> at the height of disease, therapy with large doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
