<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Presence of beta 2 Glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI), in addition to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, is an absolute requirement for binding <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This binding is frequently observed with beta 2GPI coated alone, however many <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> react only with beta 2GPI complexed to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, but not with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that a subgroup of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human beta 2GPI binds to this protein only when it is coated on a solid surface, but not if it is in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, beta 2GPI present in goat serum is strongly fixed by the coated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and the complexes formed bind as well <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> as the rabbit antibodies to beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diluent used for testing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>, has a strong incidence on <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>'s reactivity as it can be a source of beta 2GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody binding to beta 2GPI, Prothrombin, Protein S, and Annexin V, coated in the presence or in the absence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, was tested in 55 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The strongest binding of antibodies was observed in 39 plasma to a mixture of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and purified human beta 2GPI, however 17 samples also presented a significant reactivity to beta 2GPI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine plasmas contained antibodies to Prothrombin, 4 to Protein S, 3 to Annexin V, and 1 to Protein C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most of the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> are directed to a complex of beta 2GPI and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> although in some patients antibodies to beta 2GPI alone or to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding proteins are present </plain></SENT>
