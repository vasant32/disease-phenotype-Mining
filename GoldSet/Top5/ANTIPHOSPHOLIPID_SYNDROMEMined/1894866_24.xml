<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an increased level of serum anticardiolipin antibodies with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in 14 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 6 and recurrent fetal loss in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Valvular lesions were observed on two-dimensional echocardiography in 11 patients (32%) (9 women and 2 men), aged 24 to 57 years (mean +/- 1 SD 36 +/- 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal echocardiographic findings were observed in 9 (64%) of 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> versus 1 (17%) of 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and 1 (7%) of 14 patients with recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common echocardiographic abnormality was mitral leaflet thickening, found in five patients; this was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> in three and with combined mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and regurgitation in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Localized subvalvular mitral thickening was observed in one patient and calcification of the anulus in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve thickening was observed in two patients, one of whom also had a moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vegetation-like lesions on the mitral or aortic valve were found in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that valvular lesions are commonly found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, particularly when the syndrome is manifested by peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The location and appearance of valvular lesions in this syndrome are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most patients have no clinically significant valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic studies are often informative in these patients </plain></SENT>
