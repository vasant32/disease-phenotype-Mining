<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate the role of anti-beta(2)-GPI-ab as unique biological marker in RM related to antiphospholipid (aPL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF STUDY: A cohort study that included 59 cases, divided in two groups, was designed: group 1 comprised 43 pregnant women with 'obstetric' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and group 2 included 16 cases with similar complaints but only having repeatedly anti-beta(2)-GPI-ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and/or inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anticardiolipin antibodies (aCA), anti-beta(2)-GPI-ab, and other autoantibodies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Miscarriages</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature births</z:hpo>, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, live births, placental and systemic thromboses were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in previous obstetric complications were detected (P = 1.00-0.164) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the treatment, differences in number of obstetric complications were not seen (P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Live births were similar in two groups (88.4% and 93.7%; P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Placental <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was equal in both groups, 93.3% versus 80% (P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that anti-beta(2)-GPI-ab may be considered a biological marker for obstetric APS </plain></SENT>
