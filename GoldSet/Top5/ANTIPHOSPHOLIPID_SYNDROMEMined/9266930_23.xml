<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> observed during primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APAS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used the MAIPA test to examine the frequency and specificity of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> directed against the major platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> (GP IIb-IIIa, GP Ib-IX, GP Ia-IIa and GP IV) in patients where SLE and APAS were associated or not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with a series of 26 ITP patients, 46% of whom were shown to possess anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> directed against one or more of the platelet surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When APAS was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 7/10 patients possessed antibodies against GP IIb-IIIa and/or GP Ib-IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 6/10 patients were shown to have antiplatelet antibodies against GP IIb-IIIa, GP Ib-IX or GP IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for APAS (n=11) and SLE patients (n=11) without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, only one patient had an antibody directed against GP IIb-IIIa and one patient had an antibody to GP IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that antibodies directed against major platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> may play a role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> that is seen during SLE and APAS </plain></SENT>
