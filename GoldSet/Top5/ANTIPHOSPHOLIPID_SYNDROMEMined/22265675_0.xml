<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Activated protein C resistance (APCR) within a thrombin generation test (TGT) system is associated with an increased risk of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, application of the TGT is restricted by the analytical platforms used to monitor thrombin generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a routine coagulation analyser we have developed an automated chromogenic TGT that is sensitive to defects in the protein C pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The TGT was performed on a TOP500 analyser, in the presence and absence of Protac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reaction was monitored using a substrate with slow kinetics for thrombin (S-2444) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were expressed as the area under the curve normalised ratio (AUCnr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assay results were compared with Coatest APCR (expressed as APC-ratio [CoAPCr]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Samples were obtained from 35 healthy subjects and 91 patients with previous history of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 19, 17, and 9 had heterozygous factor V Leiden (FVL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), and protein C/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiencies</z:e> (PC/PS) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inter-assay imprecision in the presence and absence of Protac were 20% and &lt;5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the AUCnr of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (median [IQR]: 2.8 [2.4-4.7]) compared to: FVL (1.0 [0.7-1.2]); PC/PS (1.1 [0.9-1.2]); and APS (1.1 [0.8-1.4]); p&lt;0.001 for each comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen between the AUCnr of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and other VTE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of AUCnr and CoAPCr were: 100% and 56% for FVL; 88% and 44% for PC/PS; and 64% and 45% for APS respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The automated TGT exhibited good sensitivity to defects in the protein C pathway </plain></SENT>
