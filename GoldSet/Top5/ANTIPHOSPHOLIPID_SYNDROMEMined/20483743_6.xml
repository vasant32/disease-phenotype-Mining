<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether monocyte signaling pathways are differentially activated by IgG from patients with vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (VT) alone compared with IgG from patients with pregnancy morbidity (PM) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We purified IgG from 49 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A human monocyte cell line and ex vivo healthy monocytes were treated with 100 microg/ml IgG for 6 h, and cell extracts were examined by immunoblot using Abs to p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further investigate intracellular signaling pathways induced by these IgGs, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, TLR4, and TLR2 were used to determine their effect on TF activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only IgG from patients with VT but no PM (VT+/PM-) caused phosphorylation of NF-kappaBand p38 MAPK and upregulation of TF activity in monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were not seen with IgG from patients with PM alone (VT-/PM+), anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> Ab-positive patients without APS, or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF upregulation caused by the VT+/PM- samples was reduced by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of VT+/PM- IgG on signaling and TF upregulation were concentrated in the fraction that bound beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that IgGs from patients with diverse clinical manifestations of APS have differential effects upon phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK and TF activity that may be mediated by differential activation of TLR4 </plain></SENT>
