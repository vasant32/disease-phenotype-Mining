<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stratification for risk of recurrence after a first episode of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) would affect the duration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the incidence of recurrence of VTE in relation to clinical risk factors and standard laboratory testing for heritable thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We established a database to prospectively follow-up a cohort of unselected patients who had had a first episode of objectively proven VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We excluded patients with malignant disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were offered testing for heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: At 2 years, the cumulative recurrence rate in 570 patients was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence was lowest after surgery-related VTE (0%) and highest after unprecipitated VTE (19.4%) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>85% of patients were tested for heritable thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rates were not related to presence or absence of laboratory evidence of heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 1.50 [95% CI 0.82-2.77]; p=0.187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with a first event that was unprecipitated or was associated with a non-surgical trigger, recurrence rates did not differ in patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (1.34 [0.73-2.46]; p=0.351) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In unselected patients who have had a first episode of VTE, testing for heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> does not allow prediction of recurrent VTE in the first 2 years after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, assessment of clinical risk factors associated with the first episode of VTE does predict risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with postoperative VTE have a very low rate of recurrence </plain></SENT>
