<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation was initiated due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> which was attributed to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coagulation analysis revealed a strong and selective reduction of factor IX (F IX) activity to 1%, whereas the other <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi>-dependent factors (II, VII, X), the prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were within the therapeutic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi>-dependent factors including F IX normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because the patient suffered from a recurrence of thrombotic events, he was re-exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50438">phenprocoumon</z:chebi> and the disproportionate decline of F IX was observed again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate an increased sensitivity of F IX to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, representing an uncommon mechanism associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications under oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
