<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To comparatively assess the parameters of systolic and diastolic cardiac function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=74) who were free of cardiovascular symptoms were divided into four groups: (1) SLE (n=23); (2) SLE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL; n=18); (3) SLE with APS (n=20); and (4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS; n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsed, continuous, colour Doppler echocardiography, and M-mode and B-mode studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic dimensions were higher in SLE as compared with patients with PAPS (p=0.022 and 0.022, respectively), with a trend towards a lower fractional shortening in SLE (p=0.07), suggesting systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters of diastolic function were more impaired in patients with APS, reflected by lower left ventricular and right ventricular E wave to A wave (E:A) ratios in patients with APS (groups 3, 4) compared with those without APS (groups 1, 2; 1.15 (0.40) v 1.49 (0.43), p=0.001 and 1.19 (0.31) v 1.49 (0.41), p=0.001, respectively) and a more prolonged left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT; 94.2 (24.6) v 84.4 (17) ms, respectively, p=0.055) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS were older than those without APS (47.12 (14.86) v 34.29 (12.6), p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SLE were younger than those with PAPS (38.19 (14.68) v 48.53 (13.97), p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal echocardiographic findings were detected frequently in asymptomatic patients with SLE or PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although patients with SLE were younger, left ventricular systolic function was more impaired in patients with SLE compared with those with PAPS, whereas left ventricular and right ventricular diastolic function, as reflected by IVRT and E:A ratios, were significantly more impaired in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
