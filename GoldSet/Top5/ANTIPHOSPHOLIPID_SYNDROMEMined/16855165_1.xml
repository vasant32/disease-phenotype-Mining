<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have suggested that some patients with primary aPL syndrome may progress to develop other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of women with aPL antibodies, with regard to progression of their underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To that end, a retrospective study was made of women with aPL and primary aPL syndromes who had been followed at our institution for a minimum of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed, patients interviewed, and laboratory tests were performed to determine whether the clinical nature of the disease and/or its autoantibody profile had changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were enrolled into the study (29 with aPL syndrome, 1 with consistent aPL and no syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 3 to 22 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were as follows: The autoimmune clinical features were unchanged in 27 patients, but 3 patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e>, presenting with nasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100662'>chondritis</z:hpo> (2), cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (3), and mucosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each case, these changes occurred during pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient fulfilled criteria for SLE as seen by a change in her autoantibody profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Another incidental finding was that three other patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238463" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="FNMTC|NMTC">papillary thyroid cancer</z:e>, two being diagnosed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory disease</z:e> may develop in some patients with aPL and appears to be set off by pregnancy, a known trigger for clinical thrombotic events in aPL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007115" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Thyroid cancer</z:e> may be associated with aPL, and this association warrants further study with larger number of patients </plain></SENT>
