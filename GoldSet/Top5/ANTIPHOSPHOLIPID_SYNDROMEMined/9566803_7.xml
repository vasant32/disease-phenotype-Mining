<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the antigen specificity and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> M5 type antibodies (AMA M5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight patients selected on the basis of their AMA M5 positivity were investigated in relationship to their clinical and serological profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cross-absorption studies, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation analysis were carried out for AMA M5 antigen specificity characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (65.5%) or of primary anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (PAPS) (24%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were positive for IgG or IgM anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (anti-CL) antibodies and 49% of them also displayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2-GPI) IgG were detectable in 30/38 sera (78.9%) and IgM in 34/38 (89.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While anti-CL and anti-beta2-GPI IgG antibodies were significantly associated with history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fetal loss, AMA M5 displayed a statistical association only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absorption with human beta2-GPI both in free solution or in solid phase as well as with CL liposomes or CL/beta2-GPI liposome complexes did not affect AMA M5 fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While AMA M5 activity is absorbed by whole <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> preparations, no specific reactivities against several human, bovine and rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins could be detected in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AMA M5 appear to be detectable in both primary and secondary APS, displaying a strong association with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although strictly related to anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies, AMA M5, anti-CL and anti-beta2-GPI antibodies represent distinct serological markers of the APS </plain></SENT>
