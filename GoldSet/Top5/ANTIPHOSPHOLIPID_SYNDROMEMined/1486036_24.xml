<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some investigators have reported that a serum protein, beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta 2GP1), either alone or in combination with negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, may be the antigen for anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine these reports further, ELISA tests, inhibition experiments, Ouchterlony and Western blot techniques were used to examine anticardiolipin binding to beta 2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> were studied, as well as whole IgG immunoglobulin and affinity purified (a.p.) IgG aCL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed no binding of aCL antibodies to beta 2GP1 in the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>. beta 2GP1 caused enhanced binding of aCL antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, but this enhancement was not observed in inhibition experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> occurred in the absence of beta 2GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> binding activity by beta 2GP1 was observed for APS, but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that beta 2GP1 is not the antigen for aCL antibodies, nor is it likely that the antibody recognizes shared beta 2GP1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, this protein may make <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> more available for aCL binding on solid surfaces by some yet undefined mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect may not extend to aqueous suspensions </plain></SENT>
