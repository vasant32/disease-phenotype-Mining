<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study of pregnancies in women with this syndrome in an attempt to define a common means of caring these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Women with APS followed in Internal Medicine Department and in Gynecology Department since 1989 were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen women with primary APS had a total of 51 pregnancies, 39 (76%) of which ended in embryonic (n = 24) or fetal (n = 15) loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 6/39 untreated pregnancies led to a live birth, including 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 pregnancies treated preventively for obstetric complications, 6 led to a live birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatments used were dissimilar and included aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, either alone or in association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these 6 live births were obtained by aspirin alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gravidic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040524,C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">toxemia</z:e> was observed in one untreated patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The obstetric prognosis for untreated APS is appalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The benefit of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy in association with aspirin remains to be demonstrated, ideally in a protocol comparing aspirin alone with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
