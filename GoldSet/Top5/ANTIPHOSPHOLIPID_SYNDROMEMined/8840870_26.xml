<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients produce anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies, but the role of these antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study used a unique CD-1 mouse model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to determine whether anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 (beta 2 GP1) antibodies induced immunologically in these animals are thrombogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The CD-1 mouse model enables measurement of the kinetics of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> induced in the femoral vein of the animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals are first anesthetized, then one femoral vein is exposed and subjected to a standardized, nonpenetrating "pinch" injury that induces a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vein is trans-illuminated, and the growing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> is visualized on a television screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of formation and disappearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> as well as its area can be measured by a computer attached to the television </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three groups of CD-1 mice (each group comprising seven animals) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group 1 mice were actively immunized with beta 2GP1, resulting in production of anti-beta 2GP1 and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group 2 mice were actively immunized with human immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies and produced anti-human IgG as well as anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (the latter by an idiotype-anti-idiotype reaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These animals did not produce anti-beta 2GP1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Group 3 mice were immunized with human serum albumin (HSA) and produced anti-HSA but not anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation induced in the femoral veins of the experimental mice were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> area as well as mean time during which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> persisted were significantly greater in group 1 and group 2 mice compared with group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between group 1 or group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Demonstration of a thrombogenic effect of murine anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies suggests that these antibodies may be pathogenic in humans with APS </plain></SENT>
