<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether anti-CD4 antibodies can suppress experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) induced by an anti-DNA monoclonal antibody (MAb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BALB/c mice were treated with anti-CD4 MAb either before or 2 months after induction of experimental APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control mice were treated with rat IgG or phosphate buffered saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serologic and clinical manifestations of the disease were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment of mice with anti-CD4 before or 2 months after disease induction prevented the development of experimental APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treated mice did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and had fewer episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal resorption</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the treated mice did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003645'>prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and had significantly lower levels of antibodies to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi>, MIV-7, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi>, and phosphatidylserine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of CD4+ cells in the lymph nodes declined temporarily after the treatment and then returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-CD4 antibodies can prevent experimental APS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may suggest a role for anti-CD4 treatment in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
