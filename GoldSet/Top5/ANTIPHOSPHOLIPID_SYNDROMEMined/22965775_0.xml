<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was conducted in ten SLE-APS male patients and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were assessed by demographic data, clinical features, urological examination, sexual function, testicular ultrasound, seminal parameters, sperm antibodies, and hormone profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median of current age was similar in SLE-APS patients and controls with a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> in the former group (30 vs. 0 %, p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median penis circumference was significantly reduced in SLE-APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> compared to patients without this complication (8.17 vs. 9.14 cm, p = 0.0397) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SLE-APS patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> had a significantly reduced median penis circumference compared to those without this complication (7.5 vs. 9.18 cm, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing SLE-APS patients and controls, the former had a significant lower median of sperm concentration (41.1 vs. 120.06 × 10(6)/mL, p = 0.003), percentages of sperm motility (47.25 vs. 65.42 %, p = 0.047), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sperm forms by WHO guidelines (11 vs. 23.95 %, p = 0.002), and Kruger criteria (2.65 vs. 7.65 %, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding seminal analysis, the medians of sperm concentration and total sperm count were significantly lower in SLE-APS patients treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> vs. those untreated with this drug (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have observed a novel association of reduced penile size with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in SLE-APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Penis assessment should be routinely done in SLE-APS patients with fertility problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also identified that intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> underlies severe sperm alterations in these patients </plain></SENT>
