<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database from April 2005 through February 2008 revealed 22 patients with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypercoagulable work-up and neuroimaging were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were female (72.7%), and the median age was 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (77.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (54.5%), focal neurological signs (54.5%), and decreased level of consciousness (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over two-thirds (n=11; 69%) of female patients had a history of oral contraceptive use, which was the most common risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiency</z:e> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0348802" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinocerebral mucormycosis</z:e> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=1), non-Hodgkin`s <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (n=1), and unknown (n=6) were causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affected areas included superior sagittal (n=13), transverse (n=16), sigmoid (n=14), straight (n=6), and cavernous sinus (n=1); internal cerebral vein (n=2); vein of Galen (n=3); cortical veins (n=10); and internal jugular vein (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo>, and 2 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remainder (n=18, 81.8%) improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral hemorrhagic presentation or venous infarction, deep venous system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> had less favorable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presentations in our series were similar to those in other reports, although altered consciousness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cortical vein involvement was also higher than commonly reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Oral contraceptive use was a primary risk factor in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were favorable in 81.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
