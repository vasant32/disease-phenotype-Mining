<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>β₂-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">Glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (β₂GPI) is a highly abundant plasma protein and the major antigen for autoantibodies in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have described a novel function of β₂GPI as scavenger of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this in mind we investigated the conservation of β₂GPI in vertebrates and set out to identify the binding site of LPS within β₂GPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genome sequences of 42 species were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> to characterise the binding site of β₂GPI for LPS. β₂GPI could be identified in most tested vertebrates with a high overall amino acid homology of 80% or more in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPR revealed that a synthesised <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (LAFWKTDA) from domain V of β₂GPI was able to compete for binding of β₂GPI to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AFWKTDA sequence was completely conserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> containing the LPS binding site attenuated the inhibition by β₂GPI in a cellular model of LPS-induced tissue factor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other important sites, such as the binding site for anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, were also preserved. β₂GPI is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, which suggests that the function of β₂GPI may be more important than anticipated </plain></SENT>
