<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) has become a major health problem in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined, postoperative recurrence of VTE in patients with preoperative venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and evaluated factors that are relevant to the occurrence of postoperative VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four cases out of 38500 had been diagnosed preoperatively as having VTE in the period of 1995-2001 at Kitasato University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative VTE was detected in four patients (9%) out of these 44 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (antiphosholipid syndrome) or recent episode of VTE within 1 month were higher in the incidence of postoperative recurrence of VTE than the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Temporary infra-vena cava filters were placed to prevent pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in twelve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 of the patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were detected in or at the filter before explantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (7%) had undergone thrombolysis therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative VTE was not found in patients who had already received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) for 3 or more months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that newly developed VTE occurred perioperatively in 9% of patients with preoperative VTE, and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and a recent episode of VTE were considered as risk factors of perioperative VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary infra-vena cava filters are a valuable device for prevention of postoperative pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
