<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared 29 infants born to 23 mothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with a group of control children matched for year and gestational age at birth and route of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, mothers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> were treated with accepted therapeutic regimens, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin, and others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neonatal complications in the study infants included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> (14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome (three), bronchopulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (two), necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> (two), <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (two), neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo> (one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (one), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding problems</z:hpo>, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed psychomotor development</z:hpo>, and eight were small for their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the overall rate of neonatal or childhood complications did not differ from that in the control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> and neonatal problems are common, but the childhood course for these offspring is similar to that of other premature infants </plain></SENT>
