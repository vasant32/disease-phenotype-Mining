<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS), high positive antibody titers are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Sheba Medical Center, Israel, a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION SAMPLE: Pregnant women with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anticardiolipin, a-β2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> were measured before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women were divided into those with antibody titers &gt;four times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (high positive titer, HPT group), and the rest, into the positive titer (PT) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women were treated with daily enoxaparin and aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite adverse fetal/neonatal outcome, defined as one or more of the following: fetal/neonatal loss, preterm birth ≤ 32 weeks, and birthweight below than 10th percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Composite adverse fetal/neonatal outcome was compared between the HPT and PT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maternal adverse outcomes were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 51 women with APS were followed during 55 pregnancies, 20 in the HPT and 35 in the PT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The two groups were similar with regard to previous obstetric and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among HPT women, only 7/20 (35%) pregnancies culminated in appropriately grown, live-born infants &gt;32 weeks' gestation, compared with 27/35 (77%) PT pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of adverse fetal/neonatal outcome was 5.7 times higher (95%CI 1.9-17.7) for HPT than for PT women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with APS and high positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> titers are a unique and extremely high risk group for adverse fetal/neonatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Stricter surveillance and possibly additional therapy options should be explored for this patient population </plain></SENT>
