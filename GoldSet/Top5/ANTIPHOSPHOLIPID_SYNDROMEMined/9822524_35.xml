<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In this case-control study 42 case patients and 213 control subjects (parous age-matched women without history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) were genotyped for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and protein C, protein S, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiencies</z:hpo> were investigated in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten case patients (23.8%) and 4 control subjects (1.9%; odds ratio 16.3, 95% confidence interval 4.8-54.9) carried the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>; 13 case patients (31.0%) and 9 control subjects (4.2%; odds ratio 10.2, 95% confidence interval 4.0-25.9) were carriers of the prothrombin G20210A allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, 12 case patients (28.6%) and 34 control subjects (16.0%; odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-4.5) were homozygotes for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase C677T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, mutations were found in 25 case patients (59.5%) and 47 control patients (22.2%; odds ratio 5.2, 95% confidence interval 4.9-19.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient carried the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and 1 the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e>, whereas 2 women had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The significant risk estimates of having a pregnancy-related venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in the presence of the prothrombotic genetic risk factors analyzed suggest to screen for these mutations women with a personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> during pregnancy or the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
