<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is difficult as a result of limited specificity of existing assays for detecting clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta 2GPI) antibodies play a central role in the disease process of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We have investigated the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> with specificity for domain I of beta 2GPI and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>/pregnancy morbidity in an international multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Four hundred and seventy-seven patients derived from nine different centres met the inclusion criterion of having anti-beta 2GPI antibodies in their plasma/serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and results of tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies and anti-beta 2GPI antibodies were established at the different centres of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After being re-tested for the presence of IgG and/or IgM anti-beta 2GPI antibodies, the samples were tested for the presence of IgG-directed against domain I of beta 2GPI and results were correlated with the thrombotic and obstetric history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Re-testing for the presence of anti-beta 2GPI antibodies resulted in inclusion of 442/477 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG class anti-domain I antibodies were present in plasma of 243/442 patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>201/243 (83%) had a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an odds ratio of 3.5 (2.3-5.4, 95% confidence interval) for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-domain I IgG antibodies were also significantly correlated with obstetric complications [odds ratio: 2.4 (1.4-4.3, 95% confidence interval)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, the detection of IgG antibodies that are directed against domain I of beta 2GPI proved to be more strongly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and obstetric complications than those detected using the standard anti-beta 2GPI antibody assay </plain></SENT>
