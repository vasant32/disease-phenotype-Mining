<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 monocytes to cultured endothelial cells (EC) treated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (IgG-APS) or control IgG (IgG-NHS) in the presence and absence of SB 203580 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The size of an induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the femoral vein, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leukocytes to EC of cremaster muscle, tissue factor (TF) activity in carotid artery and in peritoneal macrophages, the ex vivo expression of vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in aorta preparations and platelet aggregation were studied in mice injected with IgG-APS or control IgG-NHS and with or without SB 203580 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SB 203580 significantly reduced the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 to EC in vitro, the number of leukocytes adhering to EC, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> size, the TF activity in carotid arteries and in peritoneal mononuclear cells, and the expression of VCAM-1 in aorta of mice, and completely abrogated platelet aggregation induced by IgG-APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that targeting the p38 MAPK pathway may be valuable in designing new therapy modalities for treating <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with APS </plain></SENT>
