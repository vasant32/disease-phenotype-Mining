<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare parameters of pulmonary function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 74) who were free of respiratory symptoms were divided into four groups: 1) SLE (n = 23); 2) SLE with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (aPL) (n = 18); 3) SLE with APS (n = 20); and 4) primary APS (PAPS) (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function testing, single breath diffusion capacity of <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (DLCO/SB) and echocardiography studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induced sputum cytology was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and DLCO were significantly reduced in SLE compared to PAPS patients (p = 0.039; p = 0.017; p = 0.029, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure was observed in two patients with SLE and aPL and in two with SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte and eosinophil counts in induced sputum showed no significant differences; however, a trend towards lower CD4 counts in SLE vs. PAPS was noted (p = 0.086), while in patients with both SLE and APS, a low CD4/CD8 ratio was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS were older than patients without APS (47.12+/-14.86 vs. 34.29+/-12.6, p = 0.0001), while SLE patients were younger than PAPS patients (38.19+/-14.68 vs. 48.53+/-13.97, p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormal pulmonary functions tests were detected frequently in asymptomatic patients with SLE or PAPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although SLE patients were younger, pulmonary function was significantly more impaired in SLE as compared to PAPS patients </plain></SENT>
