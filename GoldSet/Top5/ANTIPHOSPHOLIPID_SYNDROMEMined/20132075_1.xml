<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APS may be primary but is also common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-coagulant protein annexin A5 (ANXA5) is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> by interfering with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ANXA5 binding to human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When cells were cultured in serum from APS patients with a high aPL titre (aPL-S), binding of ANXA5 to HUVECs was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)G aPL against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (mAb-CL) dose-dependently reduced ANXA5 binding to endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of intravenous (IV)Ig at therapeutically relevant doses with aPL-S and mAb-aCL restored ANXA5 binding to comparable levels when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy serum (NHS) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, IVIg per se had the capacity to reduce ANXA5 binding to endothelium when added to NHS (but not to aPL-S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased ANXA5 binding to endothelium, mediated by aPL, is a novel mechanism of atherothrombosis that can be countered by IVIg in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IVIg per se could, to a lesser degree, cause decreased ANXA5 binding in NHS, which raises the possibility that some antibodies in IVIg can be involved in a side-effect reported in IVIg treatment, namely atherothrombosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing ANXA5 binding, either by addition of ANXA5 or by use of neutralizing antibodies in IVIg, represents a possible therapeutic strategy that deserves further study </plain></SENT>
