<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, protein Z (PZ)-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (ZPI) potently inhibits factor (F)Xa in a manner dependent on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and PZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) are mainly directed against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins such as beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin, and are known to interfere with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-dependent hemostatic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether purified aPL are able to interfere with inhibition of FXa by PZ/ZPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>beta2GPI modestly delayed the FXa inactivation by PZ/ZPI and most isolated aPL-IgGs were found to further increase the inhibitory potential of beta2GPI on PZ/ZPI activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Without beta2GPI, the PZ/ZPI activity was unaffected by the addition of aPL-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As PZ deficiency is hypothesized to lead to a prothrombotic state, we performed a case-control study to measure plasma levels of PZ and ZPI in 66 patients with autoimmune aPL and 152 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of low PZ levels (below the 5th percentile of controls) was significantly greater in the 37 patients with definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (24.3%) but not in the 29 aPL patients not fulfilling the criteria for APS (10.3%) compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (4.6%, P &lt; 0.001 vs. APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ZPI antigen levels were similar in patients with aPL and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concomitant PZ deficiency increased by approximately sevenfold the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in aPL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that the PZ/ZPI system is commonly impaired in aPL patients thus probably increasing the thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
