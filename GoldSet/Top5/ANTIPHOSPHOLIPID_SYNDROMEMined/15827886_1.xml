<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although the obstetric consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in pregnant rabbits have been described, there are no data on the serological and neuropathological aspects of the syndrome in their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It would also be interesting to recognize whether the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> abnormalities in rabbit fetuses relate to placental damage or depend on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, transmitted from the pregnant animal through the placenta to the fetal serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A post-mortem neuropathological examination was done on 36 adult female New Zealand rabbits, and their offspring (100 fetuses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The material was divided into 4 groups: Group I--26 pregnant rabbits with experimental APS, Group IC 10--pregnant rabbits without APS (control group I), Group II--64 fetuses derived from animals included in Group I, and Group IIC--36 fetuses derived from individuals included in Group IC (control group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antiplatelet antibodies in serum and coated on the platelets were evaluated to identify the APS in adult rabbits and their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly higher number of fetuses demonstrating weaker vitality and shorter survival time was observed in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of dead and reabsorbed fetuses was also considerably higher in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum markers of APS occurred both in Group I and II while the neuropathological evidences of APS: the thrombo-necrotic and inflammatory changes were found exclusively in APS pregnant animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cytoarchitecture of the fetal brains was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no disturbances in neuronal migration and abnormalities of cytodifferentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> in pregnant rabbits results in serological markers of the syndrome in their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of fetuses delivered from pregnant rabbits with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> remains intact despite the serological markers of the syndrome in fetus circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> in pregnant rabbits with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> depend rather on placental pathology related to the syndrome than on the syndrome per se transmitted from adult females to fetal circulation </plain></SENT>
