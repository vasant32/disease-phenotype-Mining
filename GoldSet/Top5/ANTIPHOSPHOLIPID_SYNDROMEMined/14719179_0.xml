<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the general population the incidence of pregnancy-associated VTE is approximately 1 in 1500 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of VTE is five times higher in a pregnant than in a nonpregnant woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postpartum the VTE risk is even higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women with congenital abnormalities or persistent presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> have an increased risk of VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with previous VTE have an approximately 3.5-fold increased risk of recurrent VTE during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> does not cross the placenta and is therefore the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during pregnancy, treatment is performed in the same manner as for nonpregnant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is an ongoing debate whether pregnant women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> should routinely receive prophylactic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who have hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, a combined abnormality, or a history of a severe thrombotic event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> or extended <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>) should be advised to use prophylactic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during pregnancy, starting during the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postpartum prophylaxis should be given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women with an increased risk for VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence has been presented that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is no doubt that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> is strongly associated with fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and aspirin significantly decreases the fetal loss rate during pregnancy and thus this is the treatment of choice in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Several studies indicate that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriage</z:e> may benefit from <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration during pregnancy, however, data from controlled trials have not yet been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In women with artificial heart valves, maternal and fetal complications are frequent despite anticoagulation, but oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> can reduce the risk for maternal complications </plain></SENT>
