<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) has been found to be associated with various diseases known as extra-hepatic manifestations of HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, HCV has been implicated as a cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study in a well-characterized area for epidemiological and prospective studies in the north-western part of Greece in order to address whether an aetiopathogenesis exists between HCV and APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Seventy-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C were investigated for the presence of anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies (anti-CL) and for a past medical history supportive to the diagnosis of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 24 patients with well-defined APLS (primary or secondary) and 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were tested for the presence of markers of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (anti-HCV and HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SLE patients were anti-CL-positive but none of them had developed any of the known clinical features of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 267 healthy subjects were investigated for the presence of anti-CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG and IgM anti-CL were determined by a quantitative isotype-specific solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay set up in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anti-HCV was determined using a third-generation enzyme immunoassay and a confirmatory third-generation recombinant immunoblot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Active virus replication was defined by the detection of HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> using a combination assay based on a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and a DNA enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the HCV patients, 37.3% had IgG and/or IgM anti-CL (P&lt;0.00005 compared to healthy controls (2.25%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the mean titres of each specific isotype were significantly lower in HCV patients compared with those found in the APLS patients (P&lt;0.05 for IgM and P&lt;0.001 for IgG isotypes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean titres of IgG anti-CL were also significantly lower in HCV patients compared with those found in the SLE patients (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with APLS or SLE (n = 36) tested negative for HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, neither thrombotic events nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were associated with a positive anti-CL test in HCV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of HCV patients (37.3%) had detectable anti-CL of low titre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this finding was not associated with the development of APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, none of the APLS patients was positive for HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data rather failed to reveal an aetiopathogenetic link between HCV and APLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For this reason, testing for HCV in patients with APLS or follow-up for the possibility of the development of APLS in HCV patients cannot be suggested, at least in Greek patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>More prospective studies of longer duration are required in order to address whether HCV is involved or not in the aetiopathogenesis of APLS </plain></SENT>
