<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our recent data show that binding of beta(2)GPI to oxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) or to liposomes containing anionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>(s) may facilitate the presentation of beta(2)GPI's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> by macrophages/dendritic cells to autoreactive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated intracellular trafficking of beta(2)GPI and its complexes with oxLDL or liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (PS-liposomes) in mouse macrophage-like J774 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relatively small amount of non-complexed beta(2)GPI was taken up and stagnated in the late endosome after incubating for 16h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, beta(2)GPI complexes with oxLDL or PS-liposomes were transported into the lysosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of the IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibody, WB-CAL-1, beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes were rapidly incorporated into intracellular space and were finally localized in the lysosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in vitro pulses by beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes together with WB-CAL-1 led to the expression of membranous CD36 as well as Fcgamma type I receptors (FcgammaRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that IgG immune complexes of beta(2)GPI/oxLDL provide not only FcgammaRI- but also scavenger receptor-mediated uptake of beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, beta(2)GPI/oxLDL complexes as a major atherogenic autoantigen and IgG anti-beta(2)GPI autoantibodies may facilitate antigen presentation and foam cell formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
