<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>APTT prolongation suggests a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo>, although it can also reveal the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), which is one of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> associated with a high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, differential diagnosis in patients with a prolonged APTT is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, a cross mixing test has been proposed as a useful laboratory examination for differential diagnosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a cross-mixing test utilizes a mixture of patient and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma at various ratios, the APTT value of the control plasma is prolonged by the addition of a small amount (10-20%) of the plasma from a patient with LA, while a prolonged APTT in a patient with an intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation factor deficiency</z:e> is shortened by the addition of control plasma(50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained more favorable results for LA detection with a cross mixing test by measuring APTT in 5 different mixtures of control plasma and 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100% concentrations of patient plasma with an LA-sensitive APTT reagent such as PTT-LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, we utilized a 0.2 microm filter unit to remove residual platelets from both patient and control plasma samples, which we recommend as useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that a cross-mixing examination with appropriate samples and reagents contributed to the detection of LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, some problems remain regarding the final determination and quantitative measurements of LA </plain></SENT>
