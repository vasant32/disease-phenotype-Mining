<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Viable infants were delivered from 20/25 (80%) women treated with higher dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> vs. 19/25 (76%) of women treated with lower dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lower dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> plus aspirin was as effective as higher dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo>-associated recurrent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
