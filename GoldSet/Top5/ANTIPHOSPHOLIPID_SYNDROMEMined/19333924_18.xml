<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Male (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and proliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> that is markedly accelerated by the Yaa locus encoding an extra copy of Tlr7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice with only 1 active copy of Tlr7 develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> but not APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because a major function of Toll-like receptor 7 is to induce type I interferons (IFNs), our goal was to determine whether IFNalpha can induce or accelerate the manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) in female (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight-week-old female (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice were injected with a single dose of adenovirus expressing IFNalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were monitored for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera were tested for anticardiolipin and anti-Sm/RNP antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice were killed at 17 or 22 weeks of age, and their kidneys and hearts were examined histologically and by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spleen cells were phenotyped, and enzyme-linked immunospot assays for autoantibody-producing B cells were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IFNalpha markedly accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in female (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in spleen cell numbers associated with a striking increase in the number of activated B and T cells was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Marginal-zone B cells were retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IFNalpha-induced increased titers of autoantibodies were observed, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiac damage was milder than that in male mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IFNalpha accelerates the development of renal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> in female (NZW x BXSB)F(1) mice but induces only mild APS and does not induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effect of IFNalpha on SLE disease manifestations is strain dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings are relevant to our understanding of the physiologic significance of the IFN signature </plain></SENT>
