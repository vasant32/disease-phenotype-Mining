<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antiphospholipid (aPL) syndrome, or APS,--a cluster of conditions that includes arterial or venous thromboses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, as well as recurrent fetal loss associated with elevation of aPL antibody--has been reported to occur 2-5 times more frequently in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong familial associations lead to the suspicion that aPL positivity, estimated to be present in 2% of the population, is a heritable trait in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, 2 major categories of the illness are recognized--primary and secondary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary APS may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e>, or drug-induced states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two assays, one for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> antibodies and the other for anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies, are recognized to be the gold standards for serologic diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive attempts at international standardization of aCL test results, no consensus exists for a value beyond which the test is considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a "dose-effect" relationship for aCL antibody titers has been noted--higher titers of the antibody correlate with increased numbers of thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An experimental assay for antibody against beta 2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta-2-GP1), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding protein, may become the most important assay for aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Skin findings in APS include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, ulceration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, and, when present, may be the key to diagnosis of this sometimes insidious syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation, usually with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, is the mainstay of therapy, although steroids, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, hydroxychloroquine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, and plasmapheresis may <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be beneficial adjunctive therapy </plain></SENT>
