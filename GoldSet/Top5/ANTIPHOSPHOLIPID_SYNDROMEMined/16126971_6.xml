<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study's objectives were to detect the prevalence of antiphospholipid and antioxidized <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (anti-oxLDL) antibodies among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) who did not have clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we evaluated the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM anticardiolipin, IgG, and IgM anti-beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I (anti-beta(2)GPI), and anti-oxLDL autoantibodies in 82 patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cutoff levels for detecting these autoantibodies were 15 IgG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units (GPL), 15 IgM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> units (MPL), and 25 ELISA units (EU)/mL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 17 of 82 (21%) RA patients, including 10 with low levels of IgG anticardiolipin and 7 with medium to high levels of anticardiolipin autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgM anticardiolipin was found in only 1 (1%) patient, and both IgG and IgM anti-beta(2)GPI were found in 3 (4%) patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of anti-oxLDL antibodies were found in 8 (10%) patients, 4 of whom also had elevated levels of IgG anticardiolipin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IgG anticardiolipin autoantibodies can be found in about one-fifth of RA patients who do not have clinical manifestations of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the presence of anticardiolipin signifies increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in these patients should be studied further </plain></SENT>
