<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed results of proficiency testing challenges (n = 5) distributed by the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association to examine LAC testing performed by participating laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) constituted major testing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In screening studies, LAC-sensitive APTT methods were more sensitive to weak LAC than dRVVT-based methods but less specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In confirmatory testing, dRVVT methods performed better, but performance was LAC-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest false-negative confirmatory test results were obtained for the platelet neutralization procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noncompliance with recommendations for LAC testing by the International Society on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and Haemostasis was high (8%-38%), with the majority of noncompliant laboratories failing to report results of mixing studies </plain></SENT>
