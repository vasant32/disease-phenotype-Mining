<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a concomitant evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and an assessment of multiple autoantibodies in a large population of patients with molecularly confirmed RASopathy have not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory features were analyzed in 42 RASopathy patients, the majority of whom had NS and five individuals had Noonan-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following autoantibodies were measured: Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double stranded DNA</z:chebi>, anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1, anti-ribosomal P, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), thyroid, anti-smooth muscle, anti-endomysial (AE), anti-liver cytosolic protein type 1 (LC1), anti-parietal cell (APC), anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> (AM) antibodies, anti-liver-kidney microsome type 1 antibodies (LKM-1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients (14%) fulfilled the clinical criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> [systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erythematous, polyendocrinopathy (autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS), autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo>, and autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune antibodies were observed in 52% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, three (7%) of the patients had specific gastrointestinal and liver autoantibodies without clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>Autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and autoantibodies were frequently present in patients with RASopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Until a final conclusion of the real incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in Rasopathy is drawn, the physicians should be alerted to the possibility of this association and the need for a fast diagnosis, proper referral to a specialist and ultimately, adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
