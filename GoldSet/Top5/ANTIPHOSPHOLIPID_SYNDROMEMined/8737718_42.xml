<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty pregnancies in 47 APS patients (11 primary and 36 secondary) were followed in a multidisciplinary clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients testing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> positive and having a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> were treated with low-dose aspirin (75 mg) daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with APS and a previous history of thrombotic events were treated with subcutaneous unfractionated or low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and low-dose aspirin (75 mg) daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The live birth rate increased from 19% of their previous non-treated pregnancies to 70% despite a high incidence of obstetric and fetal complications: pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> (18%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> (43%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal distress</z:e> (50%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two predictors of fetal outcome were observed: the previous obstetric history and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven pregnancies (12%) were complicated by thrombotic events during pregnancy or during the puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no thrombotic events in those receiving a low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Close obstetric monitoring by a multidisciplinary team and the use of antithrombotic therapy was effective in reducing the fetal wastage in APS pregnancies despite a high incidence of obstetric and fetal complications </plain></SENT>
