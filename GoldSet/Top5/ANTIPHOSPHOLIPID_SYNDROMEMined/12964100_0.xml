<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She also reported painful paleness of the right nipple evoked particularly by cold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was her fifth pregnancy; she had miscarried twice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>15 min, progressing from an ischemic to a hyperemic phase, accompanied by unbearable pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When first examined there was circumscribed, purplish network-patterned discoloration of the right hand with blackened discoloration of the distal nail-bed of the index finger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INVESTIGATIONS: Duplex-sonography revealed patency of the large arteries of the arm and hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>persistent foramen ovale</z:mp> and echo-density suspected to be a right atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests demonstrated anticardiolipin antibodies, suggesting an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT AND COURSE: On administration of low-molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, its dosage weight-adjusted, and 100 mg aspirin daily the discoloration of the finger quickly disappeared, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034734" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's syndrome</z:e> remained unchanged until she had stopped breast feeding (left breast only) after 8 months </plain></SENT>
