<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A study was carried out on 105 patients affected with SLE comparing the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) between patients with and without features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> profile was subsequently evaluated in the aPL positive patients with and without aPL-related events, thus excluding the patients with complications of APS possibly due to factors other than aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LA showed a strong association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, and IgG aCL with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, while no clinical features were associated with IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A considerable number of aPL positive patients with no aPL-related manifestations was also observed, suggesting the low specificity of aPL assays (54.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When studying the 60 aPL positive patients, LA was specific (91.3%) for the diagnosis of aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, whereas aCL were not specific, although IgG aCL mean levels were higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> than in those without APS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LA but not aCL positivity is a specific tool for the diagnosis of thrombotic complications due to aPL in SLE </plain></SENT>
