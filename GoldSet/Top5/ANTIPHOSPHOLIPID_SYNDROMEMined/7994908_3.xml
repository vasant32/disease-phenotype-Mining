<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The importance of the idiotypic network is represented in experimental SLE induced by active immunization of naive mice with an anti-DNA idiotype (Ab1) emulsified in adjuvant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mice after 4 months of incubation generate Ab3 having anti-DNA activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mice develop other serological markers for SLE associated with clinical and histopathological manifestations characteristic of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm further the etiological role of the idiotype in this experimental model, the mice were treated with specific anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) which were also conjugated to a toxin-saporin (Immunotoxin (IT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of hybridoma cell line producing the anti-anti-Id (anti-DNA = (Ab3)) for 48 h with the anti-Id MoAb (Ab2) reduced the production of anti-DNA by 58%, while pretreatment with the IT resulted in 86% decrease in anti-DNA secretion (saporin alone had only 12% effect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-Id MoAb had no effect on the production of immunoglobulin by an unrelated cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo treatment of mice with experimental SLE led to a significant decrease in titres of serum autoantibodies, with diminished clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were more remarkable when the IT was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These suppressive effects were specific, since an anti-Id treatment of experimental anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome was of no avail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anti-Id effect was mediated via a reduction in specific anti-DNA antibody-forming cells, and lasted only while anti-Id injections were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of the anti-Id injection was followed by a rise in titres of anti-DNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No immunological escape of new anti-DNA Ids was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results point to the importance of pathogenic idiotypes in SLE and to the specific potential of implementing anti-idiotypic therapy, enhanced by the conjugation of the anti-Id to an immunotoxin, in particular one with low spontaneous toxicity </plain></SENT>
