<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We address whether anti-β(2) GP1 antibodies can interact with phosphatidylserine (PS)-bearing CD1d on trophoblast cells and induce local <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS  CD1d-bearing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> cells were used in flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD1d-mediated cytokine induction was assessed using antibody cross-linking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokine production during co-culture of decidual lymphocytes with CD1d-bearing cells was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS  Trophoblast surface-expressed CD1d forms a complex with PS-bound β(2) GP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-β(2) GP1 mAb cross-linking causes IL12p70 release from CD1d-bearing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL12p70 release from CD1d-bearing trophoblast cells was also induced during co-culture with human decidual lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of anti-β2GP1 mAb to co-cultures resulted in a three-fold increase in IL12p70 secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFNγ secretion from decidual lymphocytes was also induced during co-culture with anti-β2GP1 mAbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS  β(2) GP1-dependent IL12 release from CD1d-bearing trophoblast in the presence of aPL may link the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> to pregnancy loss via an inflammatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
