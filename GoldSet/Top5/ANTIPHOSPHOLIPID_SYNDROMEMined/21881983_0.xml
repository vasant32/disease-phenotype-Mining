<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 88 PAPS patients, fulfilling Sapporo criteria, followed up at the rheumatology outpatient clinic, were analyzed in order to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, clinical manifestations, associated comorbidities, serologic features and treatment strategies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight PAPS patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 40.6 Â± 11.1 years, and 91% of them were Caucasian and 91% women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four (4.5%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> were identified: 2 of them (50%) had only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> episode and 2 (50%) had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> before PAPS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age, gender and ethnical distribution were comparable in groups with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the comparison of the 4 PAPS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> with those without this abnormality (n = 84) demonstrated a lower BMI [21.1 (18-24.2) vs. 27.5 (17.5-40.9) kg/m(2), P = 0.049] and frequency of venous events (0 vs. 63.1%, P = 0.023) in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (75% vs. 0, P &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (75 vs. 21.4%, P = 0.041) was observed in PAPS individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both groups were alike regarding the other clinical APS manifestations, disease duration, risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases, use of drugs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that 4.5% of PAPS patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, predominately before PAPS diagnosis, and this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> was associated with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data reinforce the need for RF diagnosis in those PAPS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
