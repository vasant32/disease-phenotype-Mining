<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model of APS induced by passive transfer of human aPL antibodies, we have shown that complement activation plays an essential and causative role in pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction, and that blocking activation of the complement cascade rescues pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given that the primary treatment for APS patients is anticoagulation throughout pregnancy, usually with sub-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, we considered the possibility that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prevents pregnancy loss by inhibiting complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> inhibits activation of complement on trophoblasts in vivo and in vitro and that anticoagulation, in and of itself, is not sufficient to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in our experimental model of APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies underscore the importance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in fetal injury associated with aPL antibodies and emphasize the importance of developing and testing targeted complement inhibitory therapy for patients with APS </plain></SENT>
