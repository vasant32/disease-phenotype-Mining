<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affinity-purified anti-beta2GPI were shown to be representative of Abs found in human sera because their activity could be virtually abolished from the IgG preparations after repeated absorptions on immobilized human beta2GPI column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that affinity-purified anti-beta2GPI: 1) do react with beta2GPI in the absence of any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, as demonstrated by the lack of <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> contaminant in the employed reagents, as well as by their comparable binding activity before and after extensive delipidation procedure; 2) can recognize beta2GPI regardless of its origin from different animal species; 3) are able to bind soluble beta2GPI with a mean Kd value of 4.65 x 10(-6) M (range 3, 4-7, 2 x 10(-6) M); 4) significantly enhance their binding avidity when beta2GPI is linked to a solid support; and 5) appear to be mainly monoreactive autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have shown that human polyclonal anti-beta2GPI are low affinity, mainly monoreactive autoantibodies directed to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> located on native beta2GPI, preserved along the species evolution </plain></SENT>
