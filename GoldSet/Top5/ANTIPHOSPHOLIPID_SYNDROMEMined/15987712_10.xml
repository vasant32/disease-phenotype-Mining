<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hybridomas producing human and murine aCL and anti-beta(2)-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (abeta2-GPI) monoclonal antibodies were injected into three groups of five female BALB/c <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding hybridomas secreting non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> of the same isotype were employed as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera and organs were collected after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paraoxonase (PON) activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and nitrotyrosine were measured in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PON activity and NO (sum of nitrate and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>) levels were reduced in the human aCL IgG group (P&lt;0.002 and P&lt;0.04, respectively), whilst <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and expression of total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity of plasma were increased (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PON and NO were decreased in the murine abeta2-GPI IgG and IgM aCL groups (P&lt;0.03 and P&lt;0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">Peroxynitrite</z:chebi> and total IgG aCL were independent predictors of PON (P&lt;0.0009 and P&lt;0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> was the only independent predictor of NO (P&lt;0.008) and of nitrotyrosine (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
