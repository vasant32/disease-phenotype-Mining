<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Rituximab is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated our clinical experience at the Ulm University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 2004, we have administered rituximab as rescue therapy to twenty-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> non-responsive to standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for rituximab were progressive loss of kidney function in thirteen cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> in five cases; humoral rejection after kidney transplantation in five cases and single cases of catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (CAPS), pre-emptive removal of ABO incompatible antibodies, pre-transplant removal of panel-reactive antibodies (PRA), and post-transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients were treated with both, plasmapheresis and rituximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Kidney function recovered in five of thirteen cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>Nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> response was observed in two of five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two of five patients with humoral rejection, kidney transplant function could be preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, blood group A antibodies and panel reactive antibodies successfully were reduced, and remission was achieved in the case of the patient with PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients died (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events (N.=10) and infectious complications (N.=15) were most likely due to immunosuppression in general and not to rituximab alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> was a serious but reversible complication in three cases and occurred particularly after the administration of high-dose rituximab (&gt;375 mg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rituximab rescue was successful in 48% of our cases (13 of 27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rituximab did not increase the complication risk of standard immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002352'>leukoencephalopathy</z:hpo> was identified as a significant rituximab complication </plain></SENT>
