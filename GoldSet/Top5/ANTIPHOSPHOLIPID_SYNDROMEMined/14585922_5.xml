<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the performance characteristics of 10 commercial kits and one in-house kit for the detection and quantification of anticardiolipin (aCL) (six kits) and anti-beta2glycoprotein 1 (anti-beta2GP1) (five kits) antibodies, and to evaluate the degree of variability between these different kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the presence of aCL and anti-beta2GP1 IgG and IgM antibodies in 67 sera from 62 patients and reviewed the data separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each serum sample was tested with six commercial aCL determination kits and with four commercial and one in-house anti-beta2GP1 determination kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then analysed the operating characteristics of each kit (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) and we analysed the absolute and 2 x 2 agreements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 62 patients included had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in 10 cases, secondary APS for eight, systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> (SLE) for 23 and other diagnoses for the remaining 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operating characteristics differed from one kit to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good agreement was found using sensitive aCL determination kit and specific anti-beta2GP1 determination kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement between kits was medium for IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 x 2 concordance studies showed a group of three aCL kits which were quite homogenous and showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anti-beta2GP1 kits formed quite a homogenous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high degree of variability still persists for aCL antibody determination posing the question of the qualification of commercial or in-house kits and the question of standardization of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A better concordance is found for high positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Good agreement exists for anti-beta2GP1 kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>aCL determination is still needed and should be complemented by anti-beta2GP1 determination </plain></SENT>
