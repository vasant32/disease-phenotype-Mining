<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 100 SLE patients in whom clinical characteristics, including features of the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS), disease activity, and damage were documented, and sera tested for aCL, abeta2GP, and aPT of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> isotypes, and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive aCL, abeta2GPI, aPT, and LA were found in 53, 84, 20, and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin (Ig)A aCL and IgG abeta2GPI were the commonest aCL (49.1%) and abeta2GPI (47%) isotypes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA abeta2GPI were associated with both a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone (p&lt;0.05) and a history of any clinical feature, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> of the APS (p&lt;0.05); IgA aCL were associated with a history of any clinical APS event (p&lt;0.05); and abeta2GPI of any isotype were associated with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings provide further evidence that screening for abeta2GPI and IgA aCL isotypes may improve the risk assessment for APS in SLE patients of African extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies are warranted to determine the clinical utility of these tests and to elucidate the genetic basis for the increased IgA aPL response in SLE patients of African extraction </plain></SENT>
