<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of sera from women with SLE--with or without--APLA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> on 10.5-d-old rat embryos in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was compared to the results of culture on sera from control women and on rat sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied sera from women with SLE with or without APLA after treatment with low doses of aspirin and glucocorticosteroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of embryos cultured in sera from women with SLE with or without APLA were malformed in comparison to only 10.2% in embryos cultured on control sera and 5.4% in embryos cultured on rat sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of anomalies was reduced to 37.5% in embryos cultured on sera from women with SLE with or without APLA after treatment, as in 6 of 13 sera, the treatment reduced or prevented the occurrence of embryonic anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When sera were divided in to low- and high-risk sera, the effect of treatment was even more significant, as the average percentage of embryonic anomalies per serum was reduced from 81.7 to 44.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific ultrastructural changes were found in the yolk sacs of the embryos cultured on the sera from women with SLE with or without APLA by transmission electron microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems that the rat embryo culture system may be an important clinical diagnostic tool to identify women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortions</z:e> in whom the etiology may be immunologic rejection of the embryo and to assess the efficacy of various treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
