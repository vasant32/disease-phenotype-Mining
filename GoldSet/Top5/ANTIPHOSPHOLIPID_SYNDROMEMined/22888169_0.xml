<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY ANSWER: Pravastatin does not prevent the effects of aPL on human first trimester trophoblast cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878751" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">late pregnancy</z:e> complications, such as pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo>, owing to direct targeting of the placenta by aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> reduces the rate of pregnancy loss, the risk for severe pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> remains high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a need to find alternative treatments for the prenatal management of patients with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> have recently been shown to prevent aPL-mediated fetal loss in mice but their effects on a human pregnancy model of APS have not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, DATA COLLECTION, METHODS: The human first trimester trophoblast cell line, HTR8, and human first trimester trophoblast primary cultures were incubated with or without a mouse anti-human beta 2 glycoprotein I (β(2)GPI) monoclonal antibody in the presence or absence of pravastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine and angiogenic factor secretion were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and multiplex analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell migration was measured using a colorimetric two-chamber migration assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN FINDINGS: Using the human first trimester trophoblast cell line, HTR8, pravastatin significantly augmented, compared with no treatment, aPL-dependent secretion of interleukin (IL)-8 (P&lt; 0.05), IL-1β (P&lt; 0.05) and soluble endoglin (P&lt; 0.01) but had no effect on aPL-induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, placenta growth factor or growth-related oncogene alpha secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pravastatin alone limited basal HTR8 cell migration (P&lt; 0.01), and did not mitigate the adverse effect of aPL on trophoblast migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pravastatin also had no impact on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors by primary human first trimester trophoblast cells exposed to aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS AND WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: While our in vitro findings suggest that pravastatin may not be effective in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in patients with APS, the in vivo condition may be more complex, and thus, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of pravastatin in the prevention of aPL-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by the American Heart Association </plain></SENT>
