<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have postulated a connection between human parvovirus B19 (B19) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies (APhL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APS) exhibit congruent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-like activity has been linked to the VP1 unique region (VP1u) of B19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the precise role of B19-VP1u in pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To elucidate the roles of VP1u in B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, the reactivity of B19-VP1u proteins with various autoantibodies were evaluated by ELISA and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant B19-VP1u protein to generate anti-sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absorption experiments were conducted to determine the binding specificity of rabbit anti-sera against B19-VP1u, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> (CL) and beta-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> I (beta2GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effects of passive transfer of polyclonal rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG antibodies on platelets, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and autoantibodies were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autoantibodies against CL, beta2GPI, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PhL) in sera from patients with B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, were cross-reactive with B19-VP1u </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistently, sera from rabbits immunized with recombinant B19-VP1u protein displayed raised detectable immunoglobulins against B19-VP1u, CL, beta2GPI and PhL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the mice immunized with anti-B19-VP1u IgG developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, prolongation of aPTT, and autoantibody against beta2GPI and PhL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These experimental results suggested the association between B19-VP1u and production of anti-beta2GPI antibodies, APhL, and APS-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Altogether, it may provide a clue in understanding the role of B19-VP1u in inducing autoantibodies and B19-associated APS manifestations </plain></SENT>
