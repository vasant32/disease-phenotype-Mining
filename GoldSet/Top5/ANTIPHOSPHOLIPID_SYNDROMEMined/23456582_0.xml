<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these antibodies affecting components of the cell nucleus are the major characteristics of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to assess importance of anticardiolipin (ACL) antibody and its association with clinical state in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cross sectional study was performed on 100 patients with SLE referred to rheumatology outpatient clinic in Ekbatan hospital in Hamadan (Iran) between 2007 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were extracted and screened for IgG and IgM using an ACL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up to 36% of patients were positive for ACL antibody that was more frequent in women than men (39.8% versus 8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was revealed between ACL antibody and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome were observed in 23.0% of patients that was more prevalent in ACL positive group compared with ACL negative group (41.7% versus 125%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of other manifestations including pregnancy-related disorders (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent abortion</z:e>), central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system defects</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was 33.3%, 25.0%, and 30.6% in ACL positive group and was 9.4%, 7.8%, and 7.8% in ACL negative group that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were more frequent in the former group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was also higher in ACL positive group than another group (22.2% versus 15.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among ACL positive patients with clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, 86.6% had medium to high titer of ACL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study emphasized value of (ACL) antibody to assess clinical status in SLE patients </plain></SENT>
