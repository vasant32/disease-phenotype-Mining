<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>APS is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> that leads to arterial and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, recurrent pregnancy loss and persistently positive aPLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical manifestations highly suggestive of APS but persistently negative conventional aPLs are classified as having seronegative APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ongoing research has revealed the existence of non-criteria antibodies proposed to be relevant to APS and that can be potentially included in the disease's classification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a literature review on the most promising antibodies of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> aPL family, which includes antibodies to a zwitterionic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding plasma proteins, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-protein complexes and anionic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these molecules can increase the diagnostic yield of APS, their clinical relevance is still debatable and needs to be confirmed by interlaboratory efforts toward standardizing diagnostic tools, in addition to experimental data and larger longitudinal studies </plain></SENT>
