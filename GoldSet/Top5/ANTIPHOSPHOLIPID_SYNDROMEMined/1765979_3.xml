<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) have few or no autoantibodies, other than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) that could be natural autoantibodies encoded by germline genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the autoantibodies marked by the human anti-DNA common idiotype 16/6 have been found to be encoded by unmutated germline genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we tested the sera of 19 patients with PAPS for the presence of the 16/6 idiotype which has also been found to be expressed on antibodies that bind <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this we used an ELISA method with antiserum against the SA1 idiotype which recognizes the 16/6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of our patients had the idiotype in at least one serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the patients there was one with a variant of PAPS with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and an IgM antibody to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> that is akin to the natural autoantibody of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice encoded by germline genes VH11 and VH12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies with ssDNA, dsDNA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 antigens decreased the serum levels of the SA1 idiotype despite absence of detectable anti-DNA antibodies by other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that within the B cell clones that produce aPL in patients with PAPS there are some that produce immunoglobulins bearing 16/6 related idiotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could indicate that some of the aPL present in patients with PAPS derive from natural autoantibody producing cell clones </plain></SENT>
