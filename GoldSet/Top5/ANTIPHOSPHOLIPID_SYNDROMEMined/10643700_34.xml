<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied levels of soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (sICAM-1, sCD54), soluble vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (sVCAM-1, sCD106), and soluble E-selectin (soluble endothelial leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 [sELAM-1, sCD62E]) in sera from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (primary APS), and compared them with those from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>-associated APS (SLE-APS) or pure SLE, as well as with those from 2 control groups composed of healthy volunteers and patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from 24 patients with primary APS, 15 patients with SLE-APS, 22 patients with pure SLE, 48 control patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 18 healthy volunteers were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays specific for sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and sELAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of sVCAM-1, but not sICAM-1 or sELAM-1, were significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient study groups compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> control patients and healthy volunteers, but did not differ between the groups of patients with primary APS, SLE-APS, or pure SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of sVCAM-1 were significantly higher in primary APS or SLE-APS patients with severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> and were negatively correlated with platelet counts in primary APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with primary APS, sVCAM-1 levels were higher if there was thrombotic kidney involvement and correlated with creatinemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum sVCAM-1 concentrations are increased in patients with primary APS, especially those with repeated thrombotic events or kidney involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that endothelial/ monocyte interaction may be important in the pathogenesis of primary APS </plain></SENT>
