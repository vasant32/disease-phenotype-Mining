<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines for the treatment of patients with obstetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) recommend low dose aspirin (LDA) and prophylactic doses of low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most clinicians use a fixed dosage of LMWH in pregnant APS women despite the fact that there are no clinical trials establishing that fixed doses are more efficacious than adjusted ones in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of adjusted single daily doses of LMWH (nadroparin) combined with LDA have thus been evaluated in 33 consecutive pregnancies in women with diagnosed obstetric APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LMWH doses were augmented as the pregnancies progressed and maternal/foetal weight increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>70-80-90 U/Kg doses ranging between 3800 and 6650 U were administered daily during the first, second and third trimesters, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LDA (100 mg/day) was also prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pregnancy outcome was successful in 97% of the patients studied, who delivered, between the 29th and 41st <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1135241" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">weeks of gestation</z:e> (mean 37.4 ±2.1 SD), 32 infants with a mean birth weight of 3084 g ± 514 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One woman (3%) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> at the 8th week of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The high live birth rate, the satisfactory mean gestational age and weight at birth and the absence of major pregnancy/neonatal-associated complications indicate that adjusted, once daily doses of LMWH together with LDA could be an efficacious treatment option for pregnant APS patients with no history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
