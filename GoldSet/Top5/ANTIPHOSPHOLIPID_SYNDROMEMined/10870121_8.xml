<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antibodies to prothrombin (aII) have been identified in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, but their clinical significance is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to investigate their prevalence and association with clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) in patients with primary APS or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of 177 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> was studied: 70 with primary APS and 107 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A control group of 87 healthy volunteers were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>aII were investigated in sera by an ELISA, using human prothrombin as antigen fixed in irradiated <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: aII prevalence in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> was 47% (57% and 40% in patients with primary APS or with SLE, respectively) significantly higher than in controls (5%) (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the whole series, thrombotic events were more prevalent in patients with aII (45% vs 28%; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aII was found to be an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR=2.4; p=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in patients with SLE, aII were associated with both arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (35% vs 14%; p=0.01), although only IgG-aII (OR=3.7; p=0.01) had an independent value as risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a relationship between aII and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was not found in primary APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>aII were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> only in patients with primary APS (OR=6.7; p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: aII seem to be a serological marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, mainly in SLE patients and/or in the arterial territory </plain></SENT>
