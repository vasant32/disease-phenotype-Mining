<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells, CD3(+)CD19(-) T cells and CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells in patients with primary APS and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell subtypes were immunophenotyped using specific monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3 CY5, anti-CD4 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>, anti-CD25, anti-Foxp3, anti-CD19 PE) and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients with APS and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of total lymphocytes, activated Th cells (CD4+CD25+), Treg cells and CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells were found significantly lower in APS patients as compared to controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A dysfunction in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells may represent one of the mechanisms leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in APS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased number of CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells of APS patients warrants further elucidation </plain></SENT>
