<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study design Ten centers performing <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> assays submitted samples that were positive in their assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty samples were identified to cover a broad range of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Samples were distributed to the 10 participating centers for evaluation of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA antibodies to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 9 (45%) were identified as positive by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 centers and 2 of 20 patients (10%) were identified as positive by 8 or 9 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 9 of 20 samples (45%) returned with mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average percent of positive samples was 29%, but results from the 10 centers ranged from a low number of positives (13%) to a high number of (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When considering a clinical diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> syndrome, laboratory concordance of results from 20 patient samples among the 10 centers was only 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, when considering a single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> of a single immunoglobulin isotype, agreement of test results was 83.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated positive <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> results should be correlated with the clinical history and confirmed by repeat testing </plain></SENT>
