<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteins, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, cells and autoantibodies were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulins were purified with affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody identification was assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting and revelation with antihuman IgG-peroxidase conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were found to be present in the BAL fluid as well as in the serum from a patient with APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, antiphosphatidylserine and antiphosphatidic acid IgG antibodies in the BAL fluid and antiphosphatidylcholine and anticardiolipin IgG antibodies in the serum were detected at high levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAL fluid protein and the percentage of neutrophils were found to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A quantitative as well as qualitative deficiency of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antibodies directed against <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> could cause <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> abnormalities and an inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These disorders may be one of the causes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> or a factor in the perpetuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
