<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the interaction between procoagulant and/or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> serine proteases and human monoclonal IgG <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and polyclonal IgG derived from patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five human monoclonal IgG with small differences in their sequences were tested for binding to protein C, activated protein C, plasmin, factor VIIa (FVIIa), FIX, FIXa, and FXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of antithrombin and anti-activated protein C were compared in 32 patients with APS, 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and 22 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified polyclonal IgG derived from APS patients with elevated levels of serum antithrombin antibodies was also tested for its functional effects on thrombin and antithrombin activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Studies of monoclonal antibodies showed that sequence changes in human aPL are important in determining their ability to bind procoagulant and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>/fibrinolytic serine proteases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean IgG antithrombin levels were significantly elevated in patients with APS and in SLE patients with aPL but no APS (SLE/aPL+) compared to healthy controls, but anti-activated protein C levels were not increased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IgG purified from patients with APS displayed higher avidity for thrombin and significantly inhibited antithrombin inactivation of thrombin compared with IgG from SLE/aPL+ patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-avidity antithrombin antibodies, which prevent antithrombin inactivation of thrombin, distinguish patients with APS from SLE/aPL+ patients, and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in APS </plain></SENT>
