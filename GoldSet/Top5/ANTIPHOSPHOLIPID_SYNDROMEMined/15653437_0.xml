<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the presence of less frequent apoH alleles may induce structural or conformational changes in these "LA-dependent" regions that may initiate more frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001844'>autoimmune responses</z:mp> in subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected patients with confirmed LA activity and none or low titers of anticardiolipin antibodies that had been sent to the laboratory for routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> determination </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that 47/74 (63.5%) of our selected LA-positive patients also had elevated apoH-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results point to two subgroups of patients according to the LA potency of apoH-dependent antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A strong positive correlation (non-linear or linear) for apoH-dependent antibody titers and LA activity was observed in both subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this study, we did not find significant differences in the distribution of apoH phenotypes among control subjects and patients with apoH-dependent/LA-positive auto- antibodies </plain></SENT>
