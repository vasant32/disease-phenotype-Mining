<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, to determine if these patients form a separate subgroup in terms of long term follow-up and MRI characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A blinded case control study comparing MRI patterns between aCL Ab positive and negative MS patients with a clinical follow-up of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 8 (5.6%; male:female ratio 2:6; 6 relapsing-remitting subtype, 1 primary progressive subtype and 1 neuromyelitis optica (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>)) of 143 consecutive patients with definite MS or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi> (71% relapsing-remitting, 18% secondary progressive and 6% primary progressive disease course; 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52093">NMO</z:chebi>) showed repeated positive aCL Ab testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a tertiary MS centre in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight aCL Ab positive patients had levels below 40 MPL/GPL units, with the majority of intervals between tests of at least 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After follow-up, none of the patients fulfilled the criteria for APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No specific MRI features were present compared with 24 matched aCL Ab negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No aCL Ab positive MS patient fulfilled the criteria for APS, arguing against a possible misdiagnosis or coexistence </plain></SENT>
