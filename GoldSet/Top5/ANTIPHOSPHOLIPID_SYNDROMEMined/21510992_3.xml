<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To uncover a possible association between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and SLE, we analyzed functional polymorphisms in the promoter and first exon of the MBL2 gene in 134 Brazilian SLE patients and 101 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotype and allele frequencies of MBL2 A/O polymorphism were significantly different between patients and controls, and the O allele was associated with an increased risk of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An association between low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> binding lectin (MBL) producer combined genotypes and increased risk for SLE was also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when stratifying SLE patients according to clinical and laboratory data, an association between the A/O genotype and nephritic disorders and between the X/Y genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined genotypes responsible for low MBL production were more frequently observed in SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate MBL2 polymorphisms as possible risk factors for SLE development and disease-related clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
