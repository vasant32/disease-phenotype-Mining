<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have shown that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> plays a crucial role in fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified tissue factor (TF), the major cellular activator of the coagulation cascade, as a key mediator in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and fetal injury in aPL antibody-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that TF in maternal neutrophils was associated with fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TF expression in neutrophils contributes to the respiratory burst and subsequent trophoblast oxidative injury and pregnancy loss induced by aPL antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also analysed how TF contributes to neutrophil activation and trophoblast injury in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that neutrophils from aPL antibody-treated mice express protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) and that stimulation of this receptor leads to neutrophil activation, trophoblast injury and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice deficient in PAR-2 and treated with aPL antibodies exhibited reduced neutrophil activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies, indicating that PAR-2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aPL antibody-induced fetal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> and pravastatin downregulate TF and PAR-2 expression in neutrophils and thus prevent pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study shows that TF signaling through PAR-2 mediates neutrophil activation and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may be an appropriate treatment for women with aPL antibody-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pregnancy complications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
