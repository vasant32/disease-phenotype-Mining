<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort study was done of 98 SLE patients followed-up for 1 y, including 18 with definite II APLS and 13 patients with definite primary APLS (I APLS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG anticardiolipin, IgG anti beta2 GPI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, VDRL and IgG antiOxLDL were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 98 study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High antiOxLDL titers were found in seven (39%) of the 18 patients with II APLS vs 10 (12.5%) of the 80 patients without APLS (P &lt; 0.01; OR = 4.45; 95% CI = 1.4-14.1) and none of the 13 patients with I APLS (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean antiOxLDL titer was not significantly higher in the SLE patients with than without II APLS (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A high antiOxLDL titer was correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01; OR = 5.77; 95% CI = 0.54-61) but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (P &gt; 0.05; OR = 1; 95% CI = 0.29-3.09), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo>, or a positive Coombs test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The antiOxLDL antibody titer was correlated with the IgG anticardiolipin antibody titer (r = 0.235; P = 0.02) and with the IgG anti-beta2 GPI antibody titer (r = 0.224; P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AntiOxLDL elevation was found in 17% of SLE patients and was significantly associated with II APLS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
