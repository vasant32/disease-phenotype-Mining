<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of 52-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was started preoperatively due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> that was aggravated by hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mitral annuloplasty was performed since the mitral valve was not severely damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her postoperative hemodynamics were stable, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was controlled easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She recovered from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> while on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>Valvular heart disease</z:hpo> is a well known feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, and there have been several reports about valve replacement in patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, valve repair has been reported in only a few such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that valve repair is better than valve replacement in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> because of its hypercoagulable tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, it seems that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a suitable method for the perioperative management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> who suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and require cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
