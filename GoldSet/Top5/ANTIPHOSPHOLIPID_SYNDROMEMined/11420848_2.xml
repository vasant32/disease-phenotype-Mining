<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome can be either primary or secondary to an underlying condition, most commonly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to review the manifestations of the APS in Israeli patients and to investigate the difference between patients with primary or secondary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the correlation between the manifestations of the disease and the antibody titers [LA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>), IgG aCL (anticardiolipin), IgM aCL] was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the study there were 90 patients with APS in the Sheba Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were recorded according to established protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial thrombotic events were present in 51.1% of the patients; cerebral ischemic attacks were the most frequent arterial events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous thrombotic events were present in 45.6% patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was the most frequent venous event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Obstetric complications were found in 37.3% of patients; the most frequent complication was abortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings of patients with primary or secondary syndrome were similar </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the antibody titers (LA, IgG aCL, IgM aCL) and clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patients received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment and antiaggregant drugs to prevent recurrence of symptoms </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and obstetric complications are the most frequent clinical findings in APS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no different in clinical manifestations between primary and secondary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and ANA were more frequent in patients with secondary APS </plain></SENT>
