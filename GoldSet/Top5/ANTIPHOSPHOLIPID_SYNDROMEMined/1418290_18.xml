<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antibody was generated by fusing peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy donor which were stimulated with an anti-idiotypic antibody to B11 (a human mAb anti-mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mammary tumor</z:e> virus-MMTV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MIV-7, in addition to being an anti-DNA antibody, also binds to MMTV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following immunization into the footpad of naive BALB/c mice with MIV-7, the mice developed anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome (APLS) and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The APLS was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (prolonged APTT), high resorption rate of fetuses and lower mean weights of the placentae and fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SLE was characterized by serological markers (e.g. anti-DNA), laboratory (increased sedimentation rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>) and histological findings (deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Active immunization of mice with mouse monoclonal anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies led to the induction of primary APLS without SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results add to our previous passive transfer model in which mouse monoclonal anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody generated from immunized mice (CAM) was infused into the tail vein and also resulted in induction of pure APLS [11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the ability to induce secondary APLS to SLE following immunization with a pathogenic idiotype of anti-DNA antibodies and to induce primary APLS with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> mAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The existence of these experimental models may permit controlled studies of novel therapeutic models </plain></SENT>
