<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The definition is based on the presence of thickening or vegetation of the valves (mainly mitral and aortic) as described by Libman and Sacks for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic and/or transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TEE, respectively) enable early and accurate diagnosis and help avoid misdiagnosis as rheumatic valve disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) in SLE patients is associated with a threefold greater risk of HVD, confirming the crucial importance of these antibodies in the pathogenic process, leading to thrombotic manifestations on valves because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Natural history is characterized by worsening of HVD over time with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APS patients undergoing valve-replacement surgery are at high risk of thrombotic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
