<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (IIP) is associated or coincidental with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and to characterize the patients with this condition, its commonly used treatment, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Files were retrieved from the hospital archives by screening records from 1980 to 2006 using the terms "SLE" and "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumor cerebri</z:e>" or "benign intracranial pressure." Medical records were screened for data regarding: (1) The prevalence of IIP among hospitalized patients; (2) the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of SLE patients reported to have at least 1 episode of IIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of 651 hospitalized SLE patients (prevalence, 1.5%) were found to have IIP, exceeding the prevalence of 1 to 19 per 100,000 reported in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients this was a presenting manifestation of SLE and the average time elapsed until IIP diagnosis was 10.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arabs were strikingly overrepresented among the 10 individuals, comprising 6 patients (versus 19% Arabs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, other central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) abnormalities were found either clinically or in laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two individuals had elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, compatible with antiphopholipid syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most commonly employed treatments were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, each in 9 patients with generally good clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose that IIP is a manifestation of SLE and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> should be considered as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
