<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Gradually progressive development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> in young people often is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, but the pathogenesis remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A young woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her mother had serological but no clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five brothers of another family had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three died suddenly; the other two have automatic defibrillators and are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hearts from the young woman and two of the three brothers who died were available for our histological examination of their cardiac conduction systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of the three hearts, the AV node was absent; in the third heart, only fragments of the AV node remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three hearts, the sinus node was nearly destroyed by a noninflammatory degeneration with no abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each heart, the interatrial and internodal pathways were similarly involved, and in the young woman, there were no myocardial cells in which these pathways normally exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these three subjects with progressive development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom died suddenly, the histological abnormalities of their cardiac conduction systems are best interpreted as resulting from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is a logical explanation for the pathogenesis of this puzzling clinical picture </plain></SENT>
