<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Prospective single centre study from Soweto, South Africa, comparing the prevalence of aPL in highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) naïve HIV positive and negative patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Coronary Syndromes (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between March 2004 and February 2008, 30 consecutive black South African HIV patients with ACS were compared to 30 black HIV negative patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HIV patients were younger (43 ± 7 vs. 54 ± 13, p = 0.004) and besides smoking (73% vs. 33%, p = 0.002) and lower <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels (0.8 ± 0.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.4, p = 0.001) had fewer risk factors than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HIV patients had a higher prevalence of anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG (47% vs. 10%, p = 0.003) and anti-prothrombin (aPT) IgG antibodies (87% vs. 21%, p &lt; 0.001) but there was no difference in the prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (44% vs. 24%, p = N/S) and aPL were not predictive of clinical or angiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment naïve black South African HIV patients with ACS are younger with fewer traditional coronary risk factors than HIV negative patients but have a higher prevalence and different expression of aPL which is likely to be an epiphenomenon of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> rather than causally linked to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and the pathogenesis of ACS </plain></SENT>
