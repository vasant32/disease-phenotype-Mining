<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, predictors for recurrent VTE were not identified in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study was undertaken to investigate risk factors for recurrent VTE events in Korean people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred-three patients newly diagnosed as VTE were enrolled from Seoul National University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rate based on risk factors for VTE were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE was calculated by the Kaplan and Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors for VTE were determined using Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 44 months, 24 (8%) of 303 patients relapsed for a total observation time of 1,217 patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidences of recurrent VTE were 3% at 1 year, 10% at 5 years, and 18% at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors for recurrent VTE were presence of residual <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (hazard ratio [HR]=3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-9.3; p=0.044), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) (HR=4.3, 95% CI 1.0-19.0; p=0.052), and age 50 years or younger (HR=2.5, 95% CI 1.0-6.6; p=0.053) by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Residual <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and APS remained predictive of recurrence by the anticoagulation-period stratified analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Western populations, Korean patients with VTE had the lower recurrent rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Extended anticoagulation is necessary for Korean patients with residual <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or APS </plain></SENT>
