<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beta 2-GPI is thought to be an important protein in the reaction between negatively charged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies which appear in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We prepared a monoclonal antibody against beta 2-GPI purified from human plasma and obtained beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma using a monoclonal antibody-coupled column </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beta 2-GPI inhibited the intrinsic blood coagulation only when added to control or beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma in excess (more than physiological concentrations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intrinsic fibrinolysis in beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi> was not impaired and, again, beta 2-GPI inhibited the intrinsic fibrinolysis only when added to control or beta 2-GPI-depleted plasma in excess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that both in vitro Actin-induced intrinsic coagulation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">dextran sulfate</z:chebi>-induced fibrinolytic activities are significantly inhibited by more than physiological concentrations of beta 2-GPI </plain></SENT>
