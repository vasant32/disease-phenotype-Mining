<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess platelet function under defined flow conditions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and to correlate the results with thrombotic complications and the presence of subsets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), and/or anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 88 randomized APS patients with or without a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with other <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (no APS) and 26 healthy subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation on the extracellular matrix were measured with a cone-and-plate(let) analyzer (CPA) by examining the percentage of total area covered with platelets (surface coverage [SC]) and the mean size of surface-bound objects (average size [AS]) and were compared with platelet responses to different <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> concentrations by conventional aggregometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under defined flow conditions, SC and AS were significantly higher for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in APS patients compared with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, other <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and healthy control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and aggregation in APS patients with thrombotic events was associated with higher levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) antigen (mean +/- SD 230.6 +/- 51.2%) and ristocetin cofactor activity (181.0 +/- 36.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No change in CPA and vWF parameters was found in APS patients with positive results for aPL who did not undergo thrombotic events or in patients with other <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CPA parameters were neither associated with the high response of platelets to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> nor associated with the presence of LAC, aCL, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CPA parameters were similarly increased irrespective of aspirin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> properties of platelets in APS patients could be mediated by high levels and activity of vWF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This complements the known ability of APS antibodies to enhance platelet response to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in conventional aggregometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CPA test was found to be valuable in differentiating APS patients with and without thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
