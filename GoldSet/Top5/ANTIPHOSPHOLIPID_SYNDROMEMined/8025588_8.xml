<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the specificity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in 148 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and 28 with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, 20 patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a control group, 64 healthy volunteers were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and control serum samples were tested for binding to seven different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antigens by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 90% of the sera from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> patients and 6% of the autoimmune patients exhibited a significant binding to platelet-activating factor (PAF), a molecule similar to the structure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the IgG fraction from one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> patients, which showed a high binding activity to PAF, was further affinity-purified using both liposomes and an affinity chromatography column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of these antibodies with PAF inhibited subsequent binding to immobilized PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations might suggest a putative interaction of antiphospholipid autoantibodies with PAF 'in vivo', which may have, in some patients, important pathophysiological consequences </plain></SENT>
