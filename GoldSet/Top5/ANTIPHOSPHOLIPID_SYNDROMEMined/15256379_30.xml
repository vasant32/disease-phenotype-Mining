<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether specific mutations in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site of beta 2GPI might affect its binding to trophoblast and in turn the anti-beta 2GPI antibody induced functional effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: beta 2GPI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to trophoblast was evaluated as human monoclonal IgM or polyclonal IgG anti-beta 2GPI antibody binding to trophoblast monolayers cultured (1) in complete medium; (2) in serum-free medium; (3) after serum starvation in the presence of purified human beta 2GPI; or (4) in the presence of beta 2GPI with single or multiple mutations in the amino acid loop Cys(281)-Lys<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi>-Lys-Glu-Lys-Lys-Cys(288) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of anti-beta 2GPI binding to trophoblast was evaluated as chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and protein release by RT-PCR and radioimmunoassay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: beta 2GPI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to trophoblast and its consequent recognition by the specific antibodies were inversely proportional to the mutation number in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-beta 2GPI antibodies reduced gonadotropin release, hormone dependent hCG <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, and protein synthesis in the presence of beta 2GPI, while the addition of the mutants or the absence of beta 2GPI had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: beta 2GPI binds to trophoblast in vitro through its fifth domain, as reported for endothelial cells, and can be recognised by anti-beta 2GPI antibodies; the antibody binding downregulates trophoblast hCG synthesis and secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such a mechanism might contribute to defective placentation in women with fetal loss associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
