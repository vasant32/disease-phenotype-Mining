<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four Egyptian patients with confirmed primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> were presented to the Budd-Chiari Study Group (BCSG) and admitted to the Tropical Medicine Department of Ain Shams University Hospital (Cairo, Egypt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete clinical evaluation and laboratory investigations, including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> workup and full radiological assessment, were performed to determine underlying disease etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BCS was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in 79.8% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in 19.1%, and fulminant in 1.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (FVLM) was the most common etiological cause of disease (53.1%), followed by mutation of the gene encoding <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) (51.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current or recent hormonal treatment was documented in 15.5% of females, and BCS associated with pregnancy was present in 17.2% of females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Etiology could not be determined in 8.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Males had significantly higher rates of MTHFR gene mutation and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and females had significantly higher rates of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A highly significant positive relationship was evident between the presence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena caval occlusion</z:e>, either alone or combined with occlusion of the hepatic veins (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FVLM is the most common disease etiology and MTHFR the second most common in Egyptian BCS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BCS etiology tends to vary with geographic region </plain></SENT>
