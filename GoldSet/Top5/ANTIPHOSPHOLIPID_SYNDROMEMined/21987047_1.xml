<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is a group of inherited or acquired conditions associated with a predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e> alter the blood itself or affect the vasculature, directly creating a detrimental environment for microsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present their series of hypercoagulable patients who underwent free flap reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> free flaps performed between January 1, 2005, and October 1, 2010, at the University of Pennsylvania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 2032 flaps were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients or 58 free flaps (2.9 percent) were identified as having a diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or previous thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 41 patients, 36 were women and five were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome, prothrombin gene mutation, factor VIII elevation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608418" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anticardiolipin antibody syndrome</z:e>, and essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with prior thrombotic events (many with concomitant events and diagnoses) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> before the age of 50, and embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (29.3 percent) were actively followed by a hematologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was 20.7 percent (12 flaps), including those occurring intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The salvage rate for a postoperative thrombosed flap in this group was 0 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The flap loss rate was 15.5 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> produces an unfavorable condition for microvascular reconstruction, free tissue transfer is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this series, the authors had an 80 percent success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Collaboration with a hematologist may be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In this group, flap <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> seems to occur in the delayed period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Even with operative reexploration, salvage rates have not been promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, IV </plain></SENT>
