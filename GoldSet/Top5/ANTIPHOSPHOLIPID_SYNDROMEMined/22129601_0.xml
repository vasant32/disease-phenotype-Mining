<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The archival records of 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) treated by kidney transplantation from March 1992 to December 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority were women (85.7%) and non-Caucasian (85.7%); the mean age at diagnosis of SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> was 24 ± 8 and 25 ± 8 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Renal biopsy was performed in 12 patients, with 75% of them showing proliferative lesions (class III and IV according to the World Health Organization and International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (93%) underwent intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time between the start of dialysis and transplantation was 30 months (range 3-103 months); 67% of the procedures involved deceased donors and 33% involved living-related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The graft survival rates were 93.3%, 90.9%, and 85.7% at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-transplant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (84%), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (17%), tacrolimus (25%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> (58%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection were noted in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a graft loss due to renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean SLICC by the time of kidney transplantation was 5 ± 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In total, 13 patients (92.8%) developed at least one infectious event during the follow-up, with one dying in the immediate post-transplant period because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients (14%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> flare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no clinical or histological evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> is the major cause of morbidity in SLE, with progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in 10-22% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite concerns about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> recurrence after renal transplantation, the data obtained in our sample indicate this procedure as a safe alternative therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
