<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consecutive women who were referred to three outpatient rheumatology clinics and who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and a history of one or more pregnancies were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were interviewed to determine outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previous pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was taken on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart to test for the presence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and anticardiolipin antibodies; on both occasions, five tests of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, with well-defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to be positive for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> if one or more tests was abnormal on both occasions and positive for anticardiolipin antibodies if the test was abnormal on both occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two women were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant associations were shown between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positivity and previous pregnancy loss (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.0 to 23.6; P = .05) and between anticardiolipin antibody positivity and previous pregnancy loss (OR, 20.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 97.0; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven women with multiple episodes of pregnancy loss were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> positive and four of these were also anticardiolipin antibody positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If patients who are transiently positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and/or anticardiolipin antibodies are considered to be test positive, the associations with pregnancy loss are no longer statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive patients, we observed stronger associations between the presence of six or more positive tests and pregnancy loss than between the presence of two to five positive tests and pregnancy loss </plain></SENT>
