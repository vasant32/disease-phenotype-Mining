<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The endothelial cell is a target of aPL which can induce a procoagulant and proinflammatory endothelial phenotype, as reported both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microparticle production is a hallmark of cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the presence of endothelial microparticles (EMP) in the plasma of APS patients was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine if there is a correlation with certain biological and clinical features, EMP levels were measured in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-free patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients, with and without aPL, in patients with non aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, as well as in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to healthy subjects, elevated plasma levels of EMP were found in patients with APS and in SLE patients with aPL, but not in SLE patients without aPL or in non aPL-related <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EMP levels were also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) detected by a positive Dilute Russell's Viper Venom time (DRVVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, we analyzed the capacity of these plasma to induce vesiculation of cultured endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an increase of EMP generated in response to plasma from patients with auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only APS plasma induced the release of EMP with procoagulant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These ex vivo and in vitro observations indicate that generation of EMP in APS and SLE patients results from an autoimmune process involving aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Production of procoagulant microparticles in APS patients may represent a new pathogenic mechanism for the thrombotic complications of this disease </plain></SENT>
