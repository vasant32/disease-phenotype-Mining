<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report that late endosomes have a pivotal role in intracellular cholesterol transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), and in drug-treated cells that mimic NPC, cholesterol accumulates in late endosomes and sorting of the lysosomal enzyme receptor is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the characteristic network of lysobisphosphatidic acid-rich membranes contained within multivesicular late endosomes regulates cholesterol transport, presumably by acting as a collection and distribution device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results also suggest that similar endosomal defects accompany the anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> syndrome and NPC </plain></SENT>
