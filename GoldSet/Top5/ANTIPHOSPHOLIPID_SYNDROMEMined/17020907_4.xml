<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of anti-factor XII (FXII) in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 127 patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM anti-FXII were tested by an in-house ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>123 healthy donors comprised the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 51 (40%) patients with SLE and 9 (7%) healthy controls were positive for anti-FXII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM anti-FXII were frequently found in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (28% and 13%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of IgG and IgM anti-FXII were higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in the control group (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-FXII was more frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (31% vs 4% for IgG and 14% vs 3% for IgM, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> than in controls (37% vs 4% for IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgG anti-FXII were more frequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> and fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (35% and 40% vs 4% for IgM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of IgM anti-FXII was not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-FXII are frequent in patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their presence is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and adverse obstetric history, making these antibodies a novel marker for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
