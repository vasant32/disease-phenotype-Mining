<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) idiopathic forms as well as others that are linked to inflammatory, vascular or structural lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a female aged 30 who presented two self limited episodes of left facial hypaesthesia (second branch of the TN), with no other accompanying symptoms and which lasted 3 7 days, with complete resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC) positive was found in two determinations conducted at a six week interval, while the rest of the findings were either negative or within values that were considered to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Following the description of a case of what may be idiopathic TSN, we discuss the possible relation this may have with the positive result for LAC </plain></SENT>
