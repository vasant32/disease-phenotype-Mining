<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among a cohort of 750 SLE patients receiving follow-up at our unit between 1985 and 2000, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with OMP were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory data were recorded, as well as cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings where available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunological tests included tests for presence and specificity of antinuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had OMP, which occurred within the first 3 years in two patients and after more than 20 years in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had focal neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) manifestations and two had diffuse neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four patients with focal NPSLE were either anticardiolipin- or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral fluid was abnormal in two of four patients who had this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four of the six patients, cerebral MRI showed evidence of vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic regimens varied, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients initially received high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OMP resolved or improved significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OMP in SLE occurs in a broad spectrum of clinical situations but is an infrequent manifestation of NPSLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This case series, together with literature review data, suggests various pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with focal or diffuse neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with focal NPSLE, a possible cause of OMP is microthrombosis associated with presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
