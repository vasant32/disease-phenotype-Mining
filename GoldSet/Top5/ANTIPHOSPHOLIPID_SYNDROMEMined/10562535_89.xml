<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>beta(2)GPI is considered to be a cofactor for the binding of serum autoantibodies from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS) and correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematosus</z:e> and recurrent fetal loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We solved the beta(2)GPI structure from a crystal form with 84% solvent and present a model containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 326 amino acid residues and four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structure reveals four complement control protein modules and a distinctly folding fifth C-terminal domain arranged like beads on a string to form an elongated J-shaped molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Domain V folds into a central beta-spiral of four antiparallel beta-sheets with two small helices and an extended C-terminal loop region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It carries a distinct positive charge and the sequence motif CKNKEKKC close to the hydrophobic loop composed of residues LAFW (313-316), resulting in an excellent counterpart for interactions with negatively charged amphiphilic substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beta(2)GPI structure reveals potential autoantibody-binding sites and supports mutagenesis studies where Trp316 and CKNKEKKC have been found to be essential for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>-binding capacity of beta(2)GPI </plain></SENT>
