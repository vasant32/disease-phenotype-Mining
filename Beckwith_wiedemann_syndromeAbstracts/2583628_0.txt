In 1963 Beckwith and Wiedemann reported a syndrome, which was characterized by umbilical hernia, macroglossia and somatic gigantism. In the literature, early intervention by tongue reduction is recommended in order to prevent both mandibular prognathism and open bite. In this paper seven cases were presented showing that early functional treatment of the stomatognatic system leads to pleasing results, both functionally and aesthetically. Therefore it is suggested, that functional treatment should replace surgical management of macroglossia in the Beckwith-Wiedemann-syndrome.
