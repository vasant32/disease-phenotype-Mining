Multiple cases of posterior helical ear pits (PHEP) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance in a very large family are reported. There are at least 2 cases of Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) within this family. Three other instances of familial PHEP and/or WBS are presented. An individual with a somewhat atypical osteopetrosis and PHEP is described. The previous literature of PHEP and the association with WBS is reviewed.
