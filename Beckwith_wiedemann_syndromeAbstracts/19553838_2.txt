Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital syndrome with some anomaly in overgrowth. Most common manifestations are exomphalos, macroglossia, gigantism, and visceromegaly. Overgrowth in tongue's size caused clinical symptoms such as dysphagia, speech disorder, strong in chewing, upper-airway obstruction, and psychological problems with appearance. Cold surgical techniques are commonly used in treating macroglossia. We presented tongue reduction with laser and its early result on a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome for macroglossia.
