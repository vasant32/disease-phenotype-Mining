The H19 locus belongs to a cluster of imprinted genes that is linked to the human Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The expression of H19 and its closely associated IGF2 gene is frequently deregulated in some human tumors, such as Wilms' tumors. In these cases, biallelic IGF2 expression and lack of expression of H19 are associated with hypermethylation of the imprinting center of this locus. These observations and others have suggested a potential tumor suppressor effect of the H19 locus. Some studies have also suggested that H19 is an oncogene, based on tissue culture systems. We show, using in vivo murine models of tumorigenesis, that the H19 locus controls the size of experimental teratocarcinomas, the number of polyps in the Apc murine model of colorectal cancer and the timing of appearance of SV40-induced hepatocarcinomas. The H19 locus thus clearly displays a tumor suppressor effect in mice.
