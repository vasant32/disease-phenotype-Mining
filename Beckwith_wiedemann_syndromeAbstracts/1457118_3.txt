The case of a 3-day-old infant with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who required anesthetic care during closure of an abdominal wall defect is presented. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome comprises a constellation of clinical features, including macroglossia, macrosomia, omphalocele, visceromegaly, mild microcephaly, facial nevus flammeus, horizontal earlobe creases, and renal medullary dysplasia. Due to the high rate of omphalocele in this syndrome, anesthetic care is frequently required during the neonatal period. Many of these infants (greater than 50%) are born prematurely. Therefore, their anesthetic care may be further complicated by associated diseases of prematurity, such as hyaline membrane disease. Additional anesthetic implications of this syndrome relate to the occurrence and management of hypoglycemia and polycythemia. Careful intraoperative management of glucose homeostasis is particularly important, since eventual neurologic outcome and intelligence will be normal provided prolonged neonatal hypoglycemia is avoided. Preoperative evaluation of the cardiac and genitourinary system, including echocardiography and renal ultrasound, are recommended because of the frequent occurrence of associated anomalies with omphalocele.
