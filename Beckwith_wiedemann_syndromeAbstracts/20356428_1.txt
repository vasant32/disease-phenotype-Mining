Two premature babies were admitted separately to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. One patient, a girl, presented with severe anaemia and thrombocytopaenia, the other, another girl, showed isolated thrombocytopaenia. During both pregnancies, ultrasound showed abnormalities of the placenta. The first patient also had intra-uterine growth restriction. A postpartum pathological examination showed abnormalities of both placentae consistent with placental mesenchymal dysplasia. Placental mesenchymal dysplasia is a rare condition which is associated with intra-uterine growth restriction, intra-uterine mortality, prematurity and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Thrombocytopaenia and anaemia are less commonly described in literature and are caused by micro-angiopathic haemolysis in the placenta. Both children had unrestricted growth and development patterns at one year and 6 months follow-up, respectively.
