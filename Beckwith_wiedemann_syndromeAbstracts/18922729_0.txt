Until the introduction of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), many studies were conducted in order to evaluate their impact upon the children's health born in such a way. The epigenetic-risk notion was invoked and a link between ART and diseases associated with imprinting alterations was suggested with different examples, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). The epigenetic "life cycle" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) concerns all the phases from gametogenesis, gamete maturation, fertilization, to early embryo development and appears particularly vulnerable to perturbations induced by superovulation, in vitro fertilization, embryo culture and embryo transfer. The studies, performed in model animal, provide a basis of the understanding of imprinting alterations induced by the ART and clinically useful information in order to improve the ART.
