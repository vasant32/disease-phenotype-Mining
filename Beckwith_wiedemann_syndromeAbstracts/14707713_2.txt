Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia, abdominal wall defects, macroglossia, organomegaly, ear pits and creases, hemihypertrophy, and increased birthweight. Children with BWS have an increased risk of malignancy. The authors present the case of a 3-year-old boy diagnosed with both BWS and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This case report will elaborate on the possibilities as to how BWS and ALL may be associated due to abnormal genomic imprinting and IGF dysregulation.
