Two patients with Wiedemann-Beckwith-Syndrome and neonatal hypoglycemia are reported. The etiology for the impaired glucose metabolism has not been elucitated as yet. In some patients pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia resulting in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was suspected. Increased somatomedin activity was also proposed. We have measured somatomedin concentrations in both patients by bioassay and radioimmunoassay and found normal or slightly reduced plasma levels with both methods.
