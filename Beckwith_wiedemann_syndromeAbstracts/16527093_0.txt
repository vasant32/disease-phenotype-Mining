Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is characterized by congenital overgrowth, macroglossia and omphalocele or umbilical hernia. Children with BWS may also have all or some of the following features: asymmetry (hemihypertrophy) of the limbs, torso or face, hypoglycemia, organomegaly, ear pits or creases, and embryonal tumors. The frequency of BWS is approximately 1:14,000 births. We present a guide for the management of children with BWS aimed at helping pediatricians and general practitioners or specialists in the clinical follow-up of these patients. This guide has been structured according to different age groups and is based on published evidence.
