 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The management of patients with a giant omphalocele remains a difficult problem. In this study, the authors described a new surgical approach for delayed closure of ventral hernia--the Lazaro da Silva's technique--in conservatively treated patients. METHODS: Ventral hernias of 11 conservatively treated patients were corrected by Lazaro da Silva's technique from 1987 to 2002 in Clinic's Hospital of UFMG. The surgical procedure consisted of the bilateral longitudinal fibroperitoneal-aponeurotic transposition, resulting in 3 different layers of closure. The evolution of these patients is reported. RESULTS: The presence of associated anomalies was observed in 8 patients (73%), with a predominance of cardiac defects. No alterations were associated with the use of silver sulfadiazine for epithelialization. Despite the size of the ventral hernia, no difficulties were related to the surgical procedure. Furthermore, no peri- and postoperative complications were observed. The hospital stay was approximately 8 days. The aesthetic result was excellent in all patients, and no recurrence of ventral hernia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results lead to the conclusion that conservative management of giant omphaloceles with delayed closure of the ventral hernia using Lazaro da Silva's technique is a safe and reliable approach for treating these critically ill patients.
