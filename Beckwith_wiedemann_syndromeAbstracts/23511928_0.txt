We report on a young woman admitted to our Cardiology Unit because of an episode of cardiac arrest related to a long-QT syndrome (LQTS). This manifestation was part of a broader phenotype, which was recognized as a mild form of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BWS owing to a maternally inherited deletion of the centromeric imprinting center, or ICR2, an extremely rare genetic mechanism in BWS. The deletion interval (198â€‰kb) also included exons 11-16 of the KCNQ1 gene, known to be responsible for LQTS at locus LQT1. No concomitant mutations were found in any other of the known LQT genes. The proposita's mother carries the same deletion in her paternal chromosome and shows manifestations of the Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). This report describes the smallest BWS-causing ICR2 deletion and provides the first evidence that a paternal deletion of ICR2 leads to a SRS-like phenotype. In addition, our observation strongly suggests that in cases of LQTS due to mutation of the KCNQ1 gene (LQT1), an accurate clinical genetic evaluation should be done in order to program the most appropriate genetic tests.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 20 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.280.
