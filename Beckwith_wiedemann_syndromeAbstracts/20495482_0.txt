Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with an increased risk of tumors in the pediatric age. We report the case of a newborn with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome presenting the simultaneous occurrence of a cystic pancreatoblastoma and an adrenal neuroblastoma. Surgery was required to treat the pancreatoblastoma, and a "wait and see" policy was adopted for the neuroblastoma, which spontaneously regressed within a few months.
