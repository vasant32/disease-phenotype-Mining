Three related new cases with almost complete trisomy 11p due to paternal balanced translocation 46, XY, t(7; 11) (q36.1; p11.1) are reported. The proband (Case 1) was a malformed stillborn with exomphalos, case 2 was diagnosed in the first trimester by direct chromosome preparations from chorionic villi, and confirmed on fetal products after termination of pregnancy. Case 3, a cousin to cases 1 and 2, was a 29-weeks-old fetus with omphalocele discovered at ultrasound. Literature reports of trisomy 11p are reviewed with regard to those new cases, and the possible relationship of this chromosome imbalance with the Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is discussed.
