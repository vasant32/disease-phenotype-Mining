Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is recognized for its association with various malignancies but specific urological abnormalities may also be encountered. We report a case of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with two major urological associations--a benign bladder neck polyp and also left hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Whereas the latter is a common urological abnormality, a benign bladder neck polyp is a rare entity and may, thus, be considered to be a component of the syndrome.
