We described a simplified and high-performance test (E-Q-PCR) for rapid assessment of the DNA methylation status at LIT1, a major genetic locus of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). The E-Q-PCR test can detect and quantify the methylation changes between BWS fetuses and unaffected individuals in aminocytes as well as in lymphocytes and can be completed in 1 working day, and thus is a useful method for prenatal molecular diagnosis of BWS.
