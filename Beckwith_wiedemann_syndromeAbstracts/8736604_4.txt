We describe a child with features of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with congenital recurrent digital fibroma of infancy that extended into and replaced the marrow of the terminal phalynx of the little finger. Digital fibromas of infancy have not previously been associated with either Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or invasion into underlying bone.
