Between 1979 and 1989 21 renal tumors (8 girls and 13 boys) were diagnosed and treated in the Pediatric Hospital of the University of Erlangen. Additionally, there was evidence of nephroblastomatosis in 5 children with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and hemihypertrophy. One of these infants developed a Wilms' tumor at the age of 3 1/2 years. The most frequent tumor was the Wilms' tumor, which was diagnosed in 14 children. Wilms' tumor are sonographically well delineated, round or oval tumors which often enclose small cysts (72%) but rarely calcifications (5%) and show inhomogenous liver like echogenicity. Metastasis in liver, spleen or abdomen occurred in 2 infants. The most frequent renal tumor in neonates was the mesoblastic nephroma (3 infants). All mesoblastic nephromas were well delineated round tumors with inhomogenous echo-texture and equal or increased echogenicity in comparison to the liver. They often enclosed small cysts but no metastasis or calcifications. Angiomyolipomas of the kidneys could be diagnosed in two children with tuberous sclerosis. These tumors were echogenic nodules spread all over the kidney. We found multilocular nephroblastomas with multiple irregularly delineated cysts in one child. In an other child multiple renal lymphomas simulating solid tumors with liver-like echogenicity could be found.
