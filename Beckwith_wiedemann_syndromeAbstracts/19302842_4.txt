We report a rare case of neonatal Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Alveolar RMS was diagnosed on the basis of excisional biopsy. Chemotherapy was initiated and followed by bone marrow transplantation. The patient, who is now 3 years and 11 months of age, is alive 46 months after the initial diagnosis, albeit with disease. We could not detect the PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR transcripts; however, we could observe hypomethylation of the differentially methylated region of the long QT intronic transcript 1. Thus, neonatal alveolar RMS with BWS may result from an alternate molecular pathway.
