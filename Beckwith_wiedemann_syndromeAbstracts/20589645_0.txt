Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is characterized by an accumulation of multiple congenital anomalies. Although patients with BWS are known to have a higher incidence of embryonal tumors, there has been no reports associated with acute leukemia. This report describes the case of a patient with BWS who developed Acute Megakaryocytic Leukemia (AMKL,FAB;M7). Because most patients with BWS present gigantism, the therapy-related toxicity of chemotherapy can be a very serious problem. This patient exhibited no therapy-related toxicity after chemotherapy, suggesting that acute leukemia with BWS may not require a reduction in dosage.
