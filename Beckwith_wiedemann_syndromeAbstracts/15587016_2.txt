In a sample survey study (questionnaires filled out by parents), all 40 patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) presented with macroglossia. Articulation problems were reported in 29 of them, which persisted in some following corrective tongue surgery. The impression emerges that the value of surgical treatment needs prospective assessment, that the parents are insufficiently informed, and that the adequacy of direct articulation therapy in BWS needs to be evaluated.
