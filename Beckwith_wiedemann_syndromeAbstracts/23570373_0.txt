Abstract Background: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth, congenital malformation and tumor predisposition. Children with BWS have a higher incidence of tumors, commonly intra-abdominal tumors such as Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Here, we describe the first case of a rare hepatic malignancy of nested stromal epithelial tumor (NSET) of the liver in a child with BWS. Case Report: A 22-month old girl with BWS had a new incidental liver mass. Her alpha-feto protein levels were normal. She underwent a liver segmentectomy. Results: Histopathological features combined with immunohistochemistry results (positivity for pan keratin (AE1/3), CD56, CK19, CD117 and CD99 (weak membranous pattern), Î²-catenin and WT1-COOH (focal)), were diagnostic of NSET of the liver. Conclusions: This is the first case of NSET of the liver associated with BWS. Its occurrence at such an early age is consistent with the tumor predisposition of BWS.
