A case of a neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is presented. Antenatal sonography detected a right adrenal cystic mass confirmed in post-natal which resolved spontaneously within 1 month. The child developed an adrenal adenoma detected by abdominal sonography at six months of surveillance. The authors review the different adrenal lesions possibly associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and specially the pseudo-tumorous lesions. The value of abdominal sonography in the neonatal periods and in the surveillance of children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is emphasized.
