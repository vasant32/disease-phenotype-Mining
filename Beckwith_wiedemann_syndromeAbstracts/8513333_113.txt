The phenomenon of parental imprinting involves the preferential expression of one parental allele of a subset of chromosomal genes and has so far only been documented in the mouse. We show here, by exploiting sequence polymorphisms in exon nine of the human insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, that only the paternally-inherited allele is active in embryonic and extra-embryonic cells from first trimester pregnancies. In addition, only the paternal allele is expressed in tissues from a patient who suffered from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Thus the parental imprinting of IGF2 appears to be evolutionarily conserved from mouse to man and has implications for the generation of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
