BACKGROUND: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare serious condition with a high rate of malignant tumors. A relationship between Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II gene located at the level of the 11p15 chromosomic region has been demonstrated. CASE: An acromegalic woman (elevated IGF I serum levels) undergoing pregnancy with a Beckwith-Wiedemann fetus is reported. We therefore reviewed data about this association and particularly fetal growth, and analyzed fetal blood samples for IGF I and II. CONCLUSION: We conclude that this association (i.e. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and acromegaly) is independent, and point out that IGF I and II might be very high in the Beckwith-Wiedemann fetus.
