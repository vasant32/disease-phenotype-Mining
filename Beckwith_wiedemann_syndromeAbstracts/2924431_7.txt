In 7 patients (5 girls, 2 boys) with the EMG or Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome, statural growth, bone age (BA), weight and pubertal development were studied longitudinally. Height was above the 90th percentile (%) for chronological age (CA) after age 2 years, reaching an average of 2.5 SD above the mean at or after puberty. Adult or attained height also exceeded significantly (P less than 0.015) parental (genetic) target height by 13.2 cm on the average. In one girl, adult height prognosis (190 cm) could be reduced to an adult height of 183 cm by high-dose estrogen treatment. In most children, growth velocity remained above the 90th % up to 4-6 years of age and normalized thereafter. In all patients studied, bone age was markedly advanced and particularly so during the first 4 years after birth. Weight was above the 90th-97th % during infancy and early childhood and remained there, appropriate or slightly subnormal for height, until adulthood, except for 3 girls who reached and maintained the 50th % during or after puberty. Spontaneous pubertal development occurred within normal limits for CA and around the 50th % for BA. Except for the marked bone age acceleration, the reason for the increased statural growth and adult height in patients with the EMG syndrome is still unknown.
