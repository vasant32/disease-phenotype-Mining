To define more precisely, in molecular terms, the region involved in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), we have studied patients with BWS and a constitutional duplication of 11p15 using eight 11p15 markers. In the first case with a de novo duplication and extra material on 11p, the region spanning pter to CALCA, excluded, was duplicated. In the second case, the rearrangement was characterized using somatic cell hybrids established with lymphocytes from the father who carried a balanced translocation t(11;18)(p15.4;p11.1). The breakpoint lay exactly in the same region. It could thus be inferred that the two sons, who were the first cases reported of BWS with dup11p15 and adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC), carried a duplication similar to that observed in the first case. Together with evidence for specific somatic chromosomal events leading to loss of 11p15 alleles in familial cases of ADCC, it can be hypothesized that a gene involved in predisposition to ADCC maps to region 11p15.5.
