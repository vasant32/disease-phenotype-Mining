We have carried out a follow-up study of 13 children with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) using a standard protocol which included facial anthropometric measurements. We confirm that most patients with WBS do well and that their clinical abnormalities become less apparent with age. We suggest that there is a characteristic neonatal appearance in WBS and that the expected pattern of facial growth generally results in a normal appearance by mid- to late childhood. We tentatively propose that there is a distinct facial anthropometric pattern profile in WBS.
