Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon resulting in differential expression of maternal and paternal alleles of a subset of genes. In the mouse, mutation of imprinted genes often results in contrasting phenotypes, depending on parental origin. The overgrowth-associated Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and the growth restriction-associated Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) have been linked with a variety of epigenetic and genetic defects affecting a cluster of imprinted genes at chromosome 11p15.5. Paternally derived and maternally derived 11p15.5 duplications represent infrequent findings in BWS and SRS, respectively. Here, we report a case in which a 6.5 Mb duplication of 11p15.4-pter resulted in SRS and BWS phenotypes in a child and her mother, respectively. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the duplication involved the maternal chromosome 11p15 in the child and the paternal chromosome 11p15 in the mother. This observation provides a direct demonstration that SRS and BWS represent specular images, both at the clinical and molecular levels.
