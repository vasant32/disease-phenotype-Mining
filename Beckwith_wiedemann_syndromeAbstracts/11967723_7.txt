We report the case of a 20-year-old female patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome presenting with high blood pressure and bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma successfully removed with laparoscopy in the same time. To our knowledge, the present case is the first observation of a bilateral pheochromocytoma occurring in the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. It provides further support for a genetic anomaly in this condition. Our case also indicates the interest of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of adrenal pheochromocytoma, even in bilateral tumors.
