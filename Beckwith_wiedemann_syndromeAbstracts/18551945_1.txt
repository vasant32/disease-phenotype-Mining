Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is associated with early development of embryonal tumours usually in the first four years of life. We describe a patient who presented with a right adrenal cyst in the first month of life and hepatoblastoma in the third month of life. A cavernous haemangioma was subsequently found in the resected tumour.
