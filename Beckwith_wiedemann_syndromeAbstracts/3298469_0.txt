From 1983 to 1985, antenatal diagnosis by fetoscopy under ultrasound guidance has been performed at our institute for 17 pregnant women between 15 and 34 weeks of gestation. Indications for fetoscopy were visualization of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic membrane for morphological anomaly and fetal blood sampling for coagulation disorder. The diagnosis, made by visual observation of the fetus, blood coagulation tests, and karyotyping revealed 12 normal fetuses and 5 abnormal fetuses (one having chromosome abnormality, one amniotic band syndrome, one cephalothracopagus, one Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and one sacral tumor). Courses of pregnancy following fetoscopy resulted in four normal full-term deliveries, six premature deliveries due to four hydramnions and two spontaneous ruptures of the membrane more than 14 weeks after fetoscopy. Three other pregnancies were interrupted due to intrauterine fetal death 11 weeks after fetoscopy in one case and to therapeutic abortion for maternal complications such as toxemia of pregnancy in two cases. The outcome of one case was unknown because the mother had moved away. The other pregnancy is still under observation at the third trimester. Although no complications in the fetuses were seen following fetoscopy, complications in the mothers included two cases of genital bleeding, one case of amniotic fluid leakage, and one cases of abruption of the fetal membrane. Symptoms in all four cases disappeared during several days of bed rest. These results demonstrate the importance of fetoscopy in prenatal diagnosis.
