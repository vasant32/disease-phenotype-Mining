We describe an infant with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) who had hepatic and pancreatic findings not previously described in BWS. These were biliary dysgenesis and enlargement and cystic dysplasia of the pancreas. The biliary dysgenesis was characterized by proliferation of abnormally shaped ducts in the portal tracts. Massive enlargement and cystic dysplasia of the pancreas was associated with ductular proliferation, virtual absence of normal exocrine tissue, and an increase in endocrine tissue.
