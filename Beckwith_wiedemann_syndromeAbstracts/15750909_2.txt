To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an intraneural perineurioma in a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Intraneural perineurioma, previously known as localized hypertrophic neuropathy, is a rare benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor arising from perineurium. This report adds a new entity in the spectrum of tumor formation in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
