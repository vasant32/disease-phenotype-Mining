We have constructed a 1-Mb contig in human chromosomal band 11p15.5, a region implicated in the etiology of several embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor, and in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Cosmid, P1, PAC, and BAC clones were characterized by NotI/SalI digestion and hybridized to a variety of probes to generate a detailed physical map that extends from D11S517 to L23MRP. Included in the map are the CARS, NAP2, p57/KIP2, KVLQT1, ASCL2, TH, INS, IGF2, H19, and L23MRP genes as well as end probes isolated from PACs. The TAPA1 gene, whose protein product can transmit an antiproliferative signal, was also localized in the contig. However, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that its expression did not correlate with tumorigenicity in G401 Wilms tumor hybrids, suggesting that TAPA1 is not responsible for the tumor suppression associated with 11p15.5. Genomic clones were used as probes in FISH analysis to map the breakpoints from three Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients and a rhabdoid tumor. Interestingly, each of the breakpoints disrupts the KVLQT1 gene, which is spread over a 400-kb region of the contig. Since 11p15.5 contains several genes with imprinted expression and one or more tumor suppressor genes, our contig and map provide a framework for characterizing this intriguing genetic environment.
