Anesthetic management of a 3-month-old boy with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome for bronchoscopy is reported. Management may be complicated by a difficult airway, congenital heart disease, and hypoglycemia. We did not have difficulty in airway management either with tracheal intubation or rigid bronchoscopy, but we could not extubate the baby because of tracheomalacia.
