A follow up examination was carried out in a 10 year old child who had been diagnosed as having Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome soon after birth. Macrosomy was seen to persist and body asymmetry and some dysmorphic aspects had become more pronounced over the years. The presence of moderate mental deficiency had led to difficulty in social relationships. In the prepuberty phase, the reappearance of hypoglycemia crises, which were also noted in the neonatal age, was of particular interest.
