 OBJECTIVE: To describe two children diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) arising from a spontaneous conception and an assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle from one patient with a long-standing history of subfertility. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Two children with the morphologic features of BWS as a result of a spontaneous conception and an ART cycle from the same patient. INTERVENTION(S): Assisted reproductive technology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Neonatal and pediatric morphologic evaluation by geneticists. RESULT(S): Two children with the morphologic features consistent with the criteria for the diagnosis of BWS. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with subfertility may be carriers for genetic disorders that can be passed to a child with or without the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The use of ART may bypass natural selection mechanisms.
