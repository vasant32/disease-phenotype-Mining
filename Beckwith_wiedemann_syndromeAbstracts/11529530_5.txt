 UNLABELLED: Analysis of a German database comprising a total of 54 patients with neonatal manifestations of persistent hyperinsulinism revealed 5 patients in whom hyperinsulinism was associated with additional clinical symptoms, suggesting an underlying syndromal disorder. Three of the patients presented with a similar yet unknown clinical entity characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, chronic pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism and congenital heart defects. A fourth patient was affected by severe congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. The fifth patient presented with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, with unusually severe and persistent hyperinsulinism requiring subtotal pancreatectomy. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that, in addition to the well-known biochemical pathways, more complex pathophysiological mechanisms can result in persistent hyperinsulinism that presents clinically with a disease involving multiple organs.
