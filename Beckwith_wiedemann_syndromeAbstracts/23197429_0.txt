We report on two daughters and a son of a Thai family who were affected with BWS. Their clinical findings consist of cleft palate, omphalocele, anterior ear creases, indented lesions on the posterior rim of the helix, macroglossia, posterior crossbite, and anterior open bite. The younger daughter and son had newly recognized findings of the BWS including sensorineural hearing loss and supernumerary flexion creases of the fingers. A novel mutation in CDKN1C (c.579delT; p.A193AfsX46) was found in all affected individuals and their mother. This mutation is located in the central highly polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat encoding a proline-alanine series of repeats (PAPA-domain). This domain is involved in MAP kinase phosphorylation. This is for the first time that sensorineural hearing loss and supernumerary flexion creases of the fingers are associated with mutation in CDKN1C.
