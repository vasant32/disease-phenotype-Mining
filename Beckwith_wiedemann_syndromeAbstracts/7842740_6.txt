A physical map encompassing the 3 Mb region containing the breakpoints of two Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome patients at chromosome band 11p15.3 is presented. The candidate tumor suppressor genes WEE1, ST5, and rhombotin, are positioned on this map relative to these Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome translocation and inversion breakpoints.
