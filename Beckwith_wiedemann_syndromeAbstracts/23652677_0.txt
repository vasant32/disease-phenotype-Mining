Endocrine tumors are a less common but important component of the clinical spectrum of a number of hereditary tumor syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the tuberous sclerosis complex, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and APC-associated polyposis. It is important to recognize the often unique clinical presentations of these tumors and possible strategies for presymptomatic screening and early diagnosis.
