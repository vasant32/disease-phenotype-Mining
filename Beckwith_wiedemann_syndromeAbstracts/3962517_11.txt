A cystic abdominal mass was removed from a male child born at 32 weeks gestation. Histological examination showed this to be a pancreoblastoma. Both clinical and histological features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome developed within the first 12 weeks of life. The child remains well and thriving with no tumour recurrence at 10 months of age.
