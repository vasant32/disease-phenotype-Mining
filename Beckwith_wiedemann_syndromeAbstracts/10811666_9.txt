PURPOSE: Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) are at increased risk for developing Wilms' tumor (WT). We reviewed the National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) records to assess clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with WT and BWS. METHODS: In the NWTSG, treating clinicians were asked to report, for each enrolled patient, whether the patient had BWS. Between 1980 and 1995, 4,669 patients were treated on two consecutive NWTSG protocols (NWTS 3 and NWTS 4). We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of BWS patients compared with patients with WT without BWS. RESULTS: Fifty-three children enrolled onto NWTS 3 and 4 were reported to have BWS. BWS patients were more likely to present with lower-stage tumors (P =.0001), with more than half (27 of 53) presenting with stage I disease. The overall treatment outcomes for the BWS patients were nearly identical to those without BWS, with overall survival at 4 years from diagnosis at 89% and 90%, respectively. Overall, 21% of the patients with BWS had bilateral disease, either at diagnosis (nine of 53) or as metachronous contralateral recurrence (two of 53). BWS patients enrolled onto NWTS 4 had smaller tumors than those enrolled onto NWTS 3 (P =.02), a trend not seen in the non-BWS patients. CONCLUSION: Like children without BWS, children with BWS and WT have an excellent prognosis with modern treatment regimens. There is a high risk of bilateral disease, and increasingly smaller tumors are being detected. This suggests that a national trial assessing the role of ultrasound screening followed by nephron-sparing surgery for some patients may be appropriate.
