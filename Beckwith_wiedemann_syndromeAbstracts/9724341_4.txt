The present report describes an example of multifocal (two) yolk sac tumor (YST) with mesenchyme-like and enteroid patterns found in the placenta (730 g) of a newborn (4200 g) with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) phenotype (macroglossia, omphalocele, hemihypertrophy, cardiomegaly, hypoglycemia). YST has not been previously reported to develop in the placenta. This case expands further the spectrum of alterations found in the placenta in the WBS and fits in the list of tumors related to WBS. ¿KW¿
