Benign hemorrhagic adrenal cysts are a cause of subdiaphragmatic mass in the fetus and neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Characteristic imaging features on ultrasonography, color Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging help differentiate adrenal hemorrhage from neonatal neuroblastoma and help avoid unnecessary surgery in these patients. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is self-limiting, and spontaneous resolution is the usual outcome. This report presents this rare condition with prenatal ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings and reviews the differential diagnosis of neonatal adrenal masses.
