<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most IRFs regulate the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta after <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, but the function of IRF6 is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding IRF6 is located in the critical region for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PIT|VWS">Van der Woude syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>; OMIM 119300) locus at chromosome 1q32-q41 (refs 2,3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disorder is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo>, and is the most common syndromic form of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> or palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>Popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome (PPS; OMIM 119500) is a disorder with a similar orofacial phenotype that also includes skin and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000078'>genital anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic overlap and linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional unrelated families affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> and distinct mutations in 13 families affected with PPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression analyses showed high levels of Irf6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of IRF6 disrupts orofacial development and are consistent with dominant-negative mutations disturbing development of the skin and genitalia </plain></SENT>
