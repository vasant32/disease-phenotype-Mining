<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By depicting the popliteal artery and peroneal nerve either in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> positions or abnormally located immediately adjacent to the pterygium, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging provides useful information for preoperative planning in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> appearance of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> is that of a band of abnormal tissue extending from the ischium to the os calcis that has signal characteristics of fibrous tissue often attached to a belly of anomalous muscle </plain></SENT>
