<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their success depends on an adequate selection of the proper one applying to each individual anatomical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Applied to limb deformity, the Ilizarov technique combines progressive correction, to joint structures flexibility restitution in case of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006380'>knee flexion contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review a continuous series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome patients managed with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of eight children (11 knees), consecutively treated between 1986 and 2007, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knee flexion ranged from 40 to 120 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>Contracture</z:hpo> (&gt; 90 degrees) was extremely severe in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Progressive correction was gained by Ilizarov external fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications during and following articular chain distraction-lengthening were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 1 to 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical realignment was rendered particularly complex by the popliteal cutaneous band itself, partly responsible of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>joint stiffness</z:hpo> and sciatic nerve shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Deformities were corrected by the Ilizarov technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complete extension was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In six cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> reccurrence required to repeat the correction, using the same technique, at a mean interval of 3-4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, four evolutive partial posterior tibial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001373'>dislocations</z:hpo> and one complete dislocation were diagnosed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic Study </plain></SENT>
