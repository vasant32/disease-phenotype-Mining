<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Affymetrix 250K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this malformation syndrome to chromosomal region 21q22.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of RIPK4 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase protein 4) showed a homozygous transversion (c.362T&gt;A) that causes substitution of a conserved isoleucine with asparagine at amino acid position 121 (p.Ile121Asn) in the serine/threonine kinase domain of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional pathogenic mutations-a homozygous transition (c.551C&gt;T) that leads to a missense substitution (p.Thr184Ile) at a conserved position and a homozygous one base-pair insertion mutation (c.777_778insA) predicted to lead to a premature stop codon (p.Arg260ThrfsX14) within the kinase domain-were observed in two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular modeling of the kinase domain showed that both the Ile121 and Thr184 positions are critical for the protein's stability and kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays also demonstrated that these mutations are critical for the catalytic activity of RIPK4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RIPK4 mediates activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and is required for keratinocyte differentiation and craniofacial and limb development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of Ripk4(-/-) mice is consistent with the human phenotype presented herein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the spectrum of malformations observed in the presented families is similar, but less severe than the conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK)-deficient human fetus phenotype; known as Cocoon syndrome; this similarity indicates that RIPK4 and CHUK might function via closely related pathways to promote keratinocyte differentiation and epithelial growth </plain></SENT>
