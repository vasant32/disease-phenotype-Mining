<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(2) To test for association, in nonsyndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (NSCL/P) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>/PPS families, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs642961, from the IRF6 enhancer AP-2α region, alone or as haplotype with rs2235371, a coding SNP (Val274Ile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Design :  IRF6 mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing and genotyping of rs642961 and rs2235371 by TaqMan technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients :  Seventy-one Swedish NSCL/P families, 24 Finnish <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> (CP) families, and 24 VWS/PPS families (seven newly recruited) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results :  Allelic and genotypic frequencies in each phenotype were compared to those of the controls, and no significant difference could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IRF6 gene mutation was detected in six of the seven new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>/PPS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association analysis of the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>/PPS sample set revealed the A allele from rs642961 to be a risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant association was detected in the Swedish CP subset of our NSCL/P collection where the G-C haplotype for rs642961-rs2235371 were at risk (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions :  Our results do not support the previously reported association between the A allele of rs642961 and the NSCL phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e>/PPS families, the A allele was a risk allele and was, in a large majority (&gt;80%), transmitted on the same chromosome as the IRF6 mutation </plain></SENT>
