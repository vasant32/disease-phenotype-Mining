<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only 11 families with 29 affected members and 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This malformation syndrome is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern, but environmental factors or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> cannot be excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variability of expression is discussed and a comparison with previously published familial cases is made: minor anomalies, if present in relatives of patients with full gene expressions, are as helpful in making the diagnosis as are major abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Careful evaluation of the proband's family is essential for diagnosis and subsequent genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
