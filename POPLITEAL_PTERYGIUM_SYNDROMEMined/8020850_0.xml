<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome is presented and the various possibilities of treatment so far reported in the literature are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical history of the 22-year-old male patient shows that there is no uniform concept in its therapy and that even multiple operations, which dealt only with the skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> and the shortened achilles tendon, were not successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An extensive neurolysis of the sciatic nerve, its transposition into deeper muscle layers and slow extension of the knee joint with a dynamic splint did improve the patient's condition and this seems to be the concept to follow even in patients with multiple previous operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009756'>popliteal pterygium</z:hpo> syndrome, an evaluation of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> in degrees would be useful and a conservative treatment with splints should be begun within the first months after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of no response to conservative therapy, an operation becomes necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery consists of the transposition of the sciatic nerve into deeper layers with simultaneous excision of fibrotic tissue, flap transfer or Z-plasty and postoperative extension of soft tissue in the knee by splinting and physiotherapy </plain></SENT>
