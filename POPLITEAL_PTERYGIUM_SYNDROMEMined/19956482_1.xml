<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only moderate successful surgical excision of the fibrotic band within the popliteal web has been reported because the nerves and vessels in the affected site are short and displaced into the web and they are attached to adjacent tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed hamstring tenotomy on the ischial tuberosity, tenotomy of the flexor hallucis longus and Z-lengthening of the Achilles tendon on the ankle in our patient, and this was followed by gradual correction using an Ilizarov external fixator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Full extension of the knee joint was achieved at the ninth postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, some recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>flexion contracture</z:hpo> was noted at two years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gradual soft tissue lengthening with an Ilizarov external fixator can be one of the optimal procedures when excision of a fibrous band and Z-plasty are not possible due to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of the nerves and vessels into a fibrotic band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a cautious approach is recommended when considering the high risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
