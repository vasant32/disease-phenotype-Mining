<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IRF gene family consists of nine members encoding transcription factors that share a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most IRFs regulate the expression of interferon-alpha and -beta after <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, but the function of IRF6 remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a full-length zebrafish irf6 cDNA, which encodes a 492 amino acid protein that contains a Smad-IRF interaction motif and a DNA-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The zebrafish irf6 gene consists of eight exons and maps to linkage group 22 closest to marker unp1375 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By in situ hybridization analysis of embryo whole-mounts and cryosections, we demonstrate that irf6 is first expressed as a maternal transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During gastrulation, irf6 expression was concentrated in the forerunner cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the bud stage to the 3-somite stage, irf6 expression was observed in the Kupffer's vesicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No expression could be detected at the 6-somite and 10-somite stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the 14-somite stage, expression was detected in the otic placode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the 17-somite stage, strong expression was also observed in the cloaca </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the pharyngula, hatch and larva periods up to 5 days post-fertilization, irf6 was expressed in the pharyngeal arches, olfactory and otic placodes, and in the epithelial cells of endoderm derived tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter tissues include the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, endodermal lining of swim bladder, liver, exocrine pancreas, and associated ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, the zebrafish expression data are consistent with the observations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100267'>lip pits</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VWS</z:e> patients, as well as more recent reports of alae nasi, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> documented in some patients </plain></SENT>
