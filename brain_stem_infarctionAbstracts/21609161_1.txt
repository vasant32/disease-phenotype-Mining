We present a case of angiomyomatous hamartoma (AMH) in the popliteal region of a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. A 14-year-old boy with a right popliteal mass and recurrent edema of the right leg was admitted to a local hospital where a diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was made. Three lymph nodes in the right popliteal fossa were removed. Histopathologic examination showed angiomyomatous hamartomas. Postoperatively, the patient was followed for 6 years. He had occasional mild edema of the right leg, but no signs of inflammation or recurrence of the angiomyomas. Our case is the first reported case of angiomyomatous hamartoma in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay (KT) syndrome.
