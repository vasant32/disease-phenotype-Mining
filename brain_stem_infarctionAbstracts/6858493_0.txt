The incidence of the neurocutaneous syndrome in children with organic brain lesions of varying origin was studied. It was shown that in reviewing the structure of this syndrome (along with the other extensively described pathological forms, such as Recklinghausen's disease, tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber disease, etc.), the neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by depigmented spots on the skin should be considered separately. The paper describes at full length the individual dermatoglyphic parameters and features of the neurological state of the patients suffering from the neurocutaneous syndrome with depigmented skin spots.
