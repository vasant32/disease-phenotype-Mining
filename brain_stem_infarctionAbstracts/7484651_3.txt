Progressive cerebral sinovenous occlusion in a neonate with Sturge-Weber syndrome was documented by using two-dimensional time-of-flight MR venography. There was no evidence of intraluminal thrombus on routine spin-echo images obtained either before or after the onset of seizures, despite MR venographic evidence in both studies of venous abnormalities.
