Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome is characterized by the triad of capillary malformations (usually port-wine stains), varicose veins or venous malformations of unusual distribution, and soft-tissue or bony hypertrophy of an extremity. The syndrome can be diagnosed on the basis of 2 of these 3 features. In the atypical form of the syndrome, capillary malformations may be absent. Recognition is possible during infancy or early childhood, and evaluation and treatment is important to minimize morbidity. We describe the case of an 11-year-old girl who presented with hyphema after a Valsalva maneuver and was found to have persistent fetal vasculature in the affected eye. She had systemic features of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and magnetic resonance venography scans of the brain and orbits were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the left hypertrophied lower limb revealed venous malformations leading to soft-tissue hypertrophy. To our knowledge, this is the first case of persistent fetal vasculature and hyphema in a patient with Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome.
