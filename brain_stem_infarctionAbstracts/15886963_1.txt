Chronic aspiration is a difficult and potentially lethal problem. Patients who have persistent soilage of the upper respiratory tract despite discontinuing oral intake may be offered surgical intervention to avoid life-threatening pulmonary infections. The Lindeman procedures (tracheoesophageal diversion and laryngotracheal separation) have gained popularity as surgical treatments for intractable aspiration because of their efficacy in preventing aspiration and their technical simplicity. A major downside of these procedures is the necessity for a tracheostoma and the loss of speech following surgery. Rarely, patients recover from the neurologic deficits which led to their intractable aspiration and desire reversal of their Lindeman procedure. While few "successful" reversals have been reported, detailed accounts of the long-term results of such patients are lacking. We describe a patient who underwent a laryngotracheal separation for intractable aspiration following a brainstem stroke. In the following six months he experienced significant neurologic recovery and, after careful evaluation, underwent surgical restoration of laryngotracheal continuity. Five years later he speaks fluently and has no dietary restrictions. Videofluooroscopic examination and quantitative voice analysis reveal near-normal laryngeal function.
