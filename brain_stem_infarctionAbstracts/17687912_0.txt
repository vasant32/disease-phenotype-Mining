PURPOSE: To estimate the efficiency of glaucoma treatment in Sturge-Weber syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 4 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome and the consecutive glaucoma seen at the Department of Ophthalmology in Bialystok between the years 1999-20005, were reviewed. Glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome was diagnosed at the age of 6 months in 1 patient, of 10-11 years in 2 patients and of 14 years in 1 patients. All patients underwent surgery. 2 eyes underwent trabeculectomy and 2 eyes had nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy with SKGel implant. RESULTS: Before the surgery the intraocular pressure was 35.2 mmHg (range from 25 to 48 mmHg). All patients required anti-glaucoma medications after surgery to keep intraocular pressure less than 22 mmHg. After surgery the mean intraocular pressure was 26.25 mmHg (range from 22 to 32 mmHg). 2 patients required 2 medications: Betoptic, and/or Trusopt, and/or Xalatan and 2 patients required 1 medication. After antiglaucoma medications mean IOP was 15.2 mmHg (range from 12 to 18 mmHg). CONCLUSION: The results of therapy for glaucoma associated with the Sturge-Weber syndrome are often disappointing.
