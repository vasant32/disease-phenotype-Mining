Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder in which skeletal hypertrophy, vascular nevi, and vessel anomalies coexist. Involvement of the cranial bone is rare, and intracranial anomalies associated with features of this syndrome are exceptional. We report a case of an adult Klippel-Trenaunay woman with a huge cranial hypertrophy harboring of the same time multiple meningiomas and a fusiform intracranial aneurysm. Although meningioma and intracranial aneurysms have been described in Klippel-Trenaunay patients, such an association has not been reported previously in patients with this syndrome.
