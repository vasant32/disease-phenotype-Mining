Somatic sensory signals provide a major source of feedback to motor cortex. Changes in somatosensory systems after stroke or injury could profoundly influence brain computer interfaces being developed to create new output signals from motor cortex activity patterns. Here we had the unique opportunity to study the responses of hand/arm area neurons in motor cortex to passive joint manipulation in a person with a longstanding brainstem stroke but intact sensory pathways. Neurons responded to passive manipulation of the contralateral shoulder, elbow or wrist as predicted from prior studies of intact primates. Thus, fundamental properties and organization was preserved despite arm/hand paralysis and damage to cortical outputs. The same neurons were engaged by imagined arm actions. These results indicate that intact sensory pathways retain the potential to influence motor cortex firing rates years after cortical outputs are interrupted and may contribute to online decoding of motor intentions for BCI applications.
