The treatment of congenital vascular malformations is still a difficult problem. Minimally invasive surgical treatments such as sclerotherapy, embolizations, and laser treatments have become increasingly applied. Arteriovenous malformations are treated by transcatheter endovascular selective arterial embolizations, venous malformations by sclerotherapy, Nd: YAG laser, and DIOMED laser treatments, and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome by endovenous DIOMED laser treatments. Most patients with congenital vascular malformations obtain good clinical outcomes after minimally invasive surgeries, although their long-term efficacy requires further investigation.
