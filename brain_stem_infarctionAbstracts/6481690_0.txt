Early and specific data on the typical calcifications seen in Sturge-Weber's syndrome are provided by computed tomography. The importance of this investigation is emphasized by the fact that standard radiographs and arteriography do not always produce clearcut results--facial angioma, epilepsy, mental retardation, hemiplegia, hemianopsia--the symptomatology can be less evident and even minimal.
