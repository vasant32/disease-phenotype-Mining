 INTRODUCTION: Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by mucocutaneous and visceral telangiectasia. It is often revealed by recurrent epistaxis. It is sometimes profuse and intractable. Hemostasis may be problematic. CASE STUDY: A 61-year-old male patient presented with severe epistaxis due to Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome. Embolization of the external carotid branches was needed for hemostasis. DISCUSSION: Embolization of external carotid artery branches can be an effective therapeutic alternative when usual treatments fail.
