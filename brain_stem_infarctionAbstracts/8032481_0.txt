An 8-year-old boy presented with symptoms compatible with a right internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images at the level of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Laboratory evaluation was positive only for sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is an uncommon cause for brainstem infarction.
