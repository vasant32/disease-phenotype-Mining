BACKGROUND: We report a case of a 61 year old man with midbrain infarction causing Claude's syndrome attributable to stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient presented with a pupil-sparing left third nerve palsy and contralateral ataxia. A background history of treated hypertension and cigarette smoking was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an area of infarction involving the left medial midbrain. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed significant stenosis of the left posterior cerebral artery. Antiplatelet therapy was instituted and the patient made a satisfactory recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of Claude's syndrome arising in association with stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery. Intracranial large vessel disease should be considered as a potential aetiologic factor in patients with similar midbrain ischaemia.
