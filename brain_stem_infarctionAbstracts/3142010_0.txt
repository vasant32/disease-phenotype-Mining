The epilepsy-bilateral cortical calcifications syndrome includes epilepsy with onset in childhood or adolescence and symmetrical calcifications of cerebral cortex with a predilection for the occipital cortex. The calcifications are sometimes visible on plain radiograph images but may be detected only by CT. Literature perusal revealed reports of 16 cases. We report a case with an aperceptive visual agnosia and marked but resolutive CT anomalies developed during a partial status epilepticus episode.
