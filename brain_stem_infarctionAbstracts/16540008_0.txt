A 34-year-old man with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) was performed three bone scintigraphies. The first one to evaluate the possibility of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Secondly, to dismiss a reflex sympathetic dystrophy in the affected lower limb and finally, due to knee pain. Magnetic resonance of pelvis and knee and biopsy of iliac spine were performed too.
