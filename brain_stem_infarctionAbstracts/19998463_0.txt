Certain terms used in medical genetics and more often in other medical fields are in need of clarification. The terms cited are frequently misunderstood, mispronounced, and/or misspelled. The discussion includes two Latin-derived terms (genua valga and calvaria), one Greek-derived term (apoptosis), one gene-derived term (RUNX), one syndromic eponym (Kartagener syndrome), and three vascular eponyms (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Parkes Weber syndrome, and Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon).
