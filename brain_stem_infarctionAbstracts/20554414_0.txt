Ipsilateral facial palsy (FP) of the peripheral-type can result from lesions involving the inferomedial tegmentum of the pons. However, cases of a medullary lesion with peripheral-type FP have rarely been reported. The authors experienced an 83-year-old man with a pontomedullary infarction who presented with ipsilateral peripheral-type FP. Brain diffusion MRI revealed a hyper-intense signal on the left dorsolateral portion of the upper medulla and pontomedullary junction. This case suggests that clinicians should take into account the possibility of a central lesion and brainstem infarction, even when patients present with peripheral-type FP.
