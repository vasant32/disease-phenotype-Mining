Summary: Here, we present a 32-year-old male with proptosis and chemosis of the left eye following a close head injury. Digital subtraction angiography of the left internal carotid artery showed a left carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) associated with a primitive trigeminal artery (PTA) variant. The patient was successfully treated with transvenous Guglielmi detachable coils embolization via the inferior petrosal sinus. The PTA variant was preserved without cerebellar or brainstem infarct.
