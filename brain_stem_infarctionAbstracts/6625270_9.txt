Reported is a case of a 34-year-old man, previously in good health, who underwent chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine for treatment of a recent whiplash injury. Immediately following manipulation, the patient became unresponsive and was found to have sustained a brain stem infarction resulting in the "Locked-In" syndrome. Ten months following the initial insult, he remained tetraplegic and mute but able to communicate by eye blinking and vertical eye movements.
