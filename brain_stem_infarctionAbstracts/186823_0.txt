After emphasizing that the treatment of a strawberry naevus in a newborn is usually unnecessary, the author shows the value of the Sonar Doppler in delimiting the extent of pseudovaricose and cavernous, venous angiomas. Arterio-venous fistulas above a certain size can be localized by this procedure. Sometimes these disappear spontaneously (traumatism, thrombosis). On the other hand, the delicate arteriovenous fistulas found in cases of the Klippel and Trenaunay triad are inaccessible to this procedure.
