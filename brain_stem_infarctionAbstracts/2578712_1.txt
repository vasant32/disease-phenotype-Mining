A patient with the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and pseudo-Kaposi elements is reported. This combination of symptoms has only been published very occasionally. Selective quantitative measurements of the peripheral tissue blood flow revealed a significantly increased cutaneous blood flow in the hypertrophied leg. This finding supports the assumption that a high perfusion rate and a high oxygen saturation are involved in the etiopathogenesis of the pseudo-Kaposi elements.
