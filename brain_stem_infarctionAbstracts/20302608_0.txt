 INTRODUCTION: Vascular malformation is associated with coagulopathies, especially when hemostasis is challenged. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an 11-year-old Hispanic girl with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome that developed disseminated intravascular coagulation after minor surgery, which was controlled by blood product transfusions and enoxaparin to address an ongoing consumptive coagulopathy. The patient, however, developed bacteremia and liver trauma that resulted in severe bleeding. To the best of our knowledge, we report here the first known instance of administering recombinant coagulation factor VIIa to control acute bleeding in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the concept of enoxaparin maintenance to suppress an ongoing consumptive coagulopathy and the use of recombinant coagulation factor VIIa to control its potentially fatal severe bleeding episodes.
