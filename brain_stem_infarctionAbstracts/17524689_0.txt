Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is characterized by the appearance of telangiectasia, phlebectasia, and a persistent reticular pattern of subcutaneous vasculature at or soon after birth. Up to 90% of cases are associated with systemic abnormalities, which include body asymmetry, cutaneous atrophy, neurological abnormalities, and vascular anomalies (nevus flammeus, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, and capillary and cavernous hemangiomas). Glaucoma is the most commonly reported ocular association of CMTC, usually presenting in infancy. We report a case of CMTC associated with the previously unreported onset of glaucoma in mid-childhood that was managed by glaucoma drainage implant surgery and review the literature on glaucoma associated with this condition.
