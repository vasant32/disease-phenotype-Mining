This pictorial assay illustrates the value of plain radiographs of the digit in diagnosing disease in children. Although the hand is regarded as a mirror of disease, the finger often points to the correct diagnosis. The authors present a series of cases for which a coned-down view of a single digit is given. In some cases the findings indicate a specific diagnosis, whereas in others only a differential diagnosis is possible. The radiographic findings and a brief differential diagnosis, as well as the definitive diagnosis, are presented for each case.
