Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by hemangiomata, varicose veins, and both bony and soft tissue hemihypertrophy. Abdominal viscera affected by ipsilateral hemangiomata include colon, liver, spleen, jejunum, kidney, and liver. We report a case of this syndrome that presented with severe anemia and extensive jeujenal varices without any other significant digestive tract lesions.
