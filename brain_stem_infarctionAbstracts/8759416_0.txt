The article presents the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. The diagnosis was set upon birth based on typical skin angiomatous nevi and hypertrophy of soft tissue and bones. Later on, the patient also developed the third element of the syndrome, i.e. varicose veins. The patient has a rare form of the disease, with hypertrophy of soft tissue in the left forearm and soft tissue and bones of his right leg. The static type macrodactylia is present on both hands and feet. The paper gives clinical description of this rare, nonhereditary disease. The need of continuous multidisciplinary monitoring of such patients is emphasized, since this syndrome should be distinguished from Parkes Weber syndrome which has essentially different prognosis.
