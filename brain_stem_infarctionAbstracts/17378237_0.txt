INTRODUCTION: Baclofen is frequently used in the management of spasticity. When the therapeutic benefit of oral baclofen is not satisfactory, intrathecal administration should be considered. This method reduces side effects due to a reduction in dosage compared to oral administration. CASE DESCRIPTION: This study presents a 52-year-old man with tetraplegia after a brainstem stroke. Four days after the placement of a Synchromed II infusion pump (100 mcg per day), the patient presented a paralytic ileus. The treatment was conservative and the dosage of intrathecal baclofen was reduced to lowest drug flow. After 15 days of treatment the ileus was resolved and the dosage progressively increased without incident. CONCLUSION: Ileus should be considered as a rare side effect after intrathecal baclofen administration, especially in cases of brainstem injury because baclofen seems to act directly over vegetative brainstem nuclei. Based on this case, it is strongly recommended to decrease the dose of intrathecal baclofen as one of the main therapeutic options.
