A pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between pulmonary arteries and veins. Patients with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome may present with this vascular malformation, which is a typical finding of the disease. Approximately 5-15% of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome patients have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and there is usually a family history of AVM in these patients. The malformations are usually located in the lower lobes. In this paper, I describe a 49-year-old male patient with dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis and epistaxis. Physical examination showed nasal telangiectasias, cyanosis of the lips and nails, and a systolic bruit over the left lung. Chest X-ray revealed a 5-cm mass in the left lower lobe and after magnetic resonance examination, together with 3-D magnetic resonance angiography, it was demonstrated to be a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. The history of a niece with a similiar history of suspected pulmonary arteriovenous fistula led me to consider the possibility of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome presenting with a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.
