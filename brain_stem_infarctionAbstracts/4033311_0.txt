The present article describes a patient with ischemia in the vascular territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, who developed in addition to other typical signs of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata, myoclonic movements of the ipsilateral vocal cord. Within a period of one year, the myoclonic movement progressed, leading to bilateral involvement of the velo-pharyngeal muscles. The essential neuropathological lesion is considered to be an impairment of the dentato-olivary System. In this respect there is a close relationship to other types of rhythmical myoclonus due to lesions of the brain-stem and cerebellum.
