A three-year-old male patient presented already at his birth a disproportion macrosomia of the left foot and a large, nodular nevus flammeus in the left hip region, which led to the tentative diagnosis of a Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. In the following years, both changes showed a continuous progression, with distinct soft-tissue swelling as well as papillomatous and verruciform vegetations of the nevus. Additionally, large, plain subcutaneous masses developed under the right shoulder, and a macrodactyly of the first and second left toe could be observed. Although several examinations had been performed in the meantime, the tentative diagnosis could not be confirmed up to that time. On the occasion of a severe local infection in the hip region, which led to the consideration of a surgical therapy, a radionuclide lymphography, a blood pool scintigraphy including dynamic phlebography and ventriculography as well as a bone scintigraphy were performed. These examinations were done simultaneously at one day in order to avoid a longer period of immobilization. The findings led to the diagnosis of a large lymphangioma, which could be confirmed histologically after surgery. In consideration of all results, the basic disorder seems to be the rare proteus syndrome rather than a Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.
