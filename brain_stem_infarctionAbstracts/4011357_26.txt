A retrospective study was made of 106 cases of facial port-wine stains. It was concluded that only patients with lesions located in the ophthalmic (or V1 trigeminal) cutaneous area are at risk for associated neuro-ocular symptoms. It is proposed that Sturge-Weber syndrome results from a dysmorphogenesis of cephalic neuroectoderm.
