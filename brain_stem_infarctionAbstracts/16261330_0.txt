Magnetic resonance imaging is currently the gold standard in the assessment of brain myelination. The normal pattern of brain myelination conforms to a fixed chronological sequence. Focal accelerated myelination is a usual pathological state and previously has only been associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. The purpose of our study is to describe alternate causes for accelerated myelination. We retrospectively reviewed serial MR scans, MR angiography, conventional angiography and the clinical progress of three children with accelerated myelination. Two patients with accelerated myelination had an underlying cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The third patient had Sturge-Weber syndrome. Our study strongly suggests that cerebral venous thrombosis with the consequent restriction of venous outflow could be a key factor in the induction of accelerated myelination. We recommend that in patients with accelerated myelination, the search for an underlying etiology should include careful evaluation of the intracranial vascular pathology, especially cerebral venous thrombosis.
