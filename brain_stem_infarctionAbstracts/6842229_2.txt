Three patients, who subsequently developed the locked-in state characterised by quadriplegia and mutism with an alert sensorium, initially had mild dysarthria and uncrossed hemisensory or hemimotor deficits involving the face and ipsilateral extremities. Case one initially mimicked a left cerebral lesion with right hemisensory deficits, a mild right facial paresis and a right homonymous field deficit. Case two initially developed both left hemimotor and hemisensory deficits and later developed a paresis of right conjugate gaze. Case three presented with left hemimotor deficit, and mild paresis of conjugate gaze to the right. All three patients died. Rostral brainstem infarctions were found at necropsy in cases one and two. Case three had a radiolucent area of the brainstem demonstrated by CT Scan. Hemisensory and hemimotor deficits also have been noted to precede reported cases of pontine infarction with the locked-in state. Acute onset of uncrossed hemisensory and hemimotor deficits with dysarthria may be caused by infarction of the pons which may predispose to the locked-in state.
