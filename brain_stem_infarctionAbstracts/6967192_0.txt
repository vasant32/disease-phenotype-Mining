Computerized tomography is much more accurate in detection of intracranial calcifications than the classic radiological methods since in makes possible demonstration of small calcifications invisible on plain films. The diagnosis of intracranial calcifications in computerized tomography depends on the size and position of calcifications and on the thickness of the visualized strate. Computerized tomography makes also possible qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of the calcifications and their relation to the nervous tissue and fluid spaces of the brain. In many cases it enables diagnosis to be made without the necessity of carrying out further neuroradiological investigations with contrast media.
