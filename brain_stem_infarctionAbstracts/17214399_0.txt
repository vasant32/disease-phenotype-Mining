We present our experience with implantation of an Ahmed glaucoma valve in a 9-year-old girl with Sturge-Weber syndrome with choroidal hemangioma. In this case of childhood glaucoma, the choice of surgical procedure should be based on the efficacy and elimination of intra-and post-operative complications. An Ahmed glaucoma valve offered safety and efficacy in controlling glaucoma. This technique avoided sudden drops in intraocular pressure and decreases the risk of intraoperative and postoperative choroidal effusion and hemorrhage. The surgical procedure was not complicated: a one-staged implant was satisfactory and a prophylactic sclerostomy was not required.
