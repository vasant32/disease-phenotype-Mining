The subject of this case study is a 29-year-old woman who suffered a brainstem stroke. She remained severely dizzy, had a non-functional left hand secondary to weakness, severe spasticity in the right hand, a right lateral sixth nerve palsy and was unable to ambulate on presentation. The stroke occurred 2&emsp14;years before presentation. The subject had been treated for 21&emsp14;months at two different stroke rehabilitation centres before presentation. Our stroke protocol includes photobiomodulation administered with the XR3T-1 device and 'muscle/bone/joint/soft tissue' recovery techniques. The patient was seen once a week for 8&emsp14;weeks and treatment sessions lasted approximately 60&emsp14;min. The results were dramatic: after 8&emsp14;weeks of implementation of our protocol, the patient demonstrated positive change in every area of her deficits as determined by improvements in physical examination findings. The gains achieved at 8&emsp14;weeks have been maintained to this day and she continues to be treated once every 4&emsp14;weeks.
