The authors give an account of their experience with the treatment of secondary glaucoma in children with Sturge-Weber's syndrome, followed up on a long-term basis (mean follow up period 6 years). Sixteen eyes of 13 children, mean age 10.5 years during the last check-up were treated: four eyes by medicamentous treatment, 12 eyes were operated. A total of 27 operations were performed: 13x cyclocryocoagulation, 11x trabeculectomy and including peroperative administration of 5-fluorouracil in 3 cases, 2x trabeculotomy and 1x laser trabeculoplasty. The criterium of therapeutic success is an intraocular pressure < or = 21 torr and a concomitant drop of the tension by at least 30% and absence of progression on the papilla or perimeter. In the whole group glaucoma is compensated in 11 eyes (68.8%). The most frequent complication was choroid ablation after filtration surgery (6x). It developed practically only in older children. In two patients bilateral glaucoma was observed despite unilateral naevus flammeus. Therefore it is necessary to check always both eyes.
