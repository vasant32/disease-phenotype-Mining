A 45-year-old man presented with enlargement of basilar artery dissecting aneurysm 10 months after suffering brain stem infarction. Combined stenting and placement of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) was planned to obliterate the aneurysm sac. Stent deployment was performed but the procedure was halted to avoid overdosing with contrast material. Cerebral angiography 10 days later showed thrombosis of the aneurysm sac and normalization of the blood flow in the basilar artery. The patient has been followed up for 2 years and showed good clinical and angiographic outcome. Stenting results in obliteration of the aneurysm sac, so a two-stage procedure is recommended.
