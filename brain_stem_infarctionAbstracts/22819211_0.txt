Classic Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is characterized by presence of flammeus nevus involving the first sensory branch of trigeminal nerve, ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and choroidal angioma. Sporadic cases of SWS without facial nevus (SWS type III) have been rarely reported. Here we report the clinical and neuroradiological findings of five patients with SWS type III and compare their findings with those described in the literature. This study confirmed that SWS type III should be considered in any child or young adult presenting with seizures or complicated migraine and intracranial unilateral calcification. The diagnosis must be confirmed with contrast-enhanced MRI images of the brain. Surgical therapy should be considered in patients with drug-resistant and persistent epileptic seizures.
