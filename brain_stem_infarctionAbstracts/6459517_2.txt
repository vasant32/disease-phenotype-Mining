A computer-based communications system was established for a quadriplegic patient who suffered a brainstem infarction that left him with normal intelligence, but without speech and without functional motor control except for the thumb of his right hand. An arm brace was developed to support the hand and thumb so it could control two switches that generated Morse code signals. An interface was also devised to translate Morse code into ASCII characters to access a personal computer. Additional codes were added to represent keyboard control functions. This device allows the patient to communicate with others and control, to some extent, his environment.
