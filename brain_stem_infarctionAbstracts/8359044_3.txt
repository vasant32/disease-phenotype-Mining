Ten patients with clinically probable brainstem stroke presenting primarily as acute dysphagia but without visible brainstem abnormality by MRI are described. The patients were evaluated with neurologic examinations, cinepharyngoesophagography, and brain MRI studies. Each patient solely or predominately experienced sudden pharyngeal dysphagia, and additional symptoms or signs other than dysphonia or dysarthria were scarce. Small vessel disease or cardiac embolism were the apparent causes of what appear to have been very discrete brainstem strokes in these patients. Acute pharyngeal dysphagia can be the sole or primary manifestation of brainstem stroke. A negative MRI study should not preclude consideration of this diagnosis, if brainstem stroke is otherwise clinically probable.
