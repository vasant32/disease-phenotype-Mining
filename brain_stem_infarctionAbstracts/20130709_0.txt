OBJECTIVE: Oral acetazolamide is a potent medical treatment for pediatric glaucoma, but ophthalmologists may have concerns that it retards weight gain in children and may choose surgical management instead. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two well children with glaucoma taking acetazolamide orally for >or=3 months. METHODS: Abnormal weight gain was determined using downward crossing of 2 percentile lines on growth charts and change in z score for weight using a hierarchical linear model. RESULTS: One patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome and growth failure was excluded when growth hormone deficiency was diagnosed. Two patients crossed 2 lines downward; both showed metabolic acidosis. The trend for the 2 reversed after medication was discontinued. The other 20 tracked steadily on growth curves. Eleven patients (11/22, 50%) showed a decline in z score for weight over the follow-up period, and the remainder showed an increase, for an overall estimate of slope in this sample of 0.01, which was not significant (p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Oral acetazolamide may cause poor weight gain in a small subset of children on treatment. Metabolic acidosis may be a mediating factor for growth failure. Our data suggest that acetazolamide does not cause significant weight changes in cases of pediatric glaucoma. Growth parameters should be followed. Growth hormone deficiency should be considered in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Prospective study is needed.
