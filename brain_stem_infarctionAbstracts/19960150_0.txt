When performed properly, bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS) for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is rarely associated with complications. Major complications reported to date include thromboembolism, brain stem infarction, pontine haemorrhage, isolated sixth nerve palsy and venous subarachnoid haemorrhage. We describe a rare case where a predominant contrast extravasation into the subarachnoid space, admixed with a small quantity of venous blood, occurring during BIPSS in a 58-year-old woman with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, was misinterpreted as venous subarachnoid haemorrhage.
