INTRODUCTION: The mesencephalic alternating syndromes or syndromes of Weber, Benedikt and Claude are uncommon in clinical practice. They are caused by a lesion in the mesencephalus which affects the third cranial nerve bundle, together with the corticospinal pathway, subthalamic nucleus and the dentato-rubric path. CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a normotensive patient who, as a consequence of a hematoma in the mesencephalic tegmentum, had the association of these three syndromes consecutively. The clinical course was favorable, so that after three months of follow-up only paralysis of the third cranial nerve bundle persisted. DISCUSSION: In the syndromes of Weber, Benedikt and Claude there is the association of ophthalmoplegia with hemiplegia, or a cerebellar hemisyndrome or contralateral abnormal movements compatible with hemiballismus, respectively. Amongst the commonest causes are expansive processes, tumors and arteriovenous malformations. More rarely they are due to cerebrovascular accidents, which are usually ischemic and occasionally hemorrhagic in aetiology. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous mesencephalic hematomas are infrequent. They make up approximately 1% of all intracranial hematomas. The commonest site is the tegmentum followed by the peduncle and tectum. They have better prognosis than other hematomas of the brainstem.
