Over a period of nine years we observed 52 children with acute neurological symptoms which were caused by a cerebrovascular disease. Fourteen patients had congenital vascular malformations, most frequently AV-angiomas (9 patients). A Sturge-Weber-Syndrome and a venous angioma were found in two cases and one patient had an aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. Thirty-eight patients had acquired cerebrovascular diseases such as ischaemic infarctions (22), intracranial haemorrhages without vascular malformations (14) and thromboses of the dural sinus (2). The cerebral infraction was a complication of a congenital heart disease in 8 children, two others suffered from chronic renal insufficiency and were on haemodialysis. Two children had a trauma of the internal carotid artery and in one patient a large haemorrhagic infarct was caused by hypernatremic dehydration. In 9 patients (6 females, 3 males) no obvious aetiology of the infarct could be found. However, in most of these cases a nonspecific febrile illness preceded the neurological manifestations. The thrombosis of the dural sinus occurred in a 6-week old previously healthy infant and in a 3-year old boy as a complication of a nephrotic syndrome. Intracranial haemorrhages (without cerebrovascular malformations) occurred in 14 patients, mainly as a complication of haematological diseases (acute lymphatic leukaemia, severe aplastic anaemia, haemophilia A, lupus erythematodes). Four children had spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages without obvious causes. The prognosis for survival was good in children with infarcts, but persisting neurological deficits were more severe than in children with haemorrhages. At the acute stage the lethality was higher in children with intracranial haemorrhages.
