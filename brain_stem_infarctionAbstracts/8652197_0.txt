We present a patient with top-of-the-basilar syndrome that was preceded by hemiballismus and progressed to coma and tetraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive infarction in the basilar artery territory. Cerebral angiography confirmed basilar artery obstruction. The patient died in spite of anticoagulation therapy.
