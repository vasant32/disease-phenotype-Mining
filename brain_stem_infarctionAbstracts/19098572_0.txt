We present a case of gingival overgrowth, with aesthetic repercussions, associated with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome. Treatment consisted of electric gingivectomy. We noted that it is necessary to carefully monitor hemorrhaging during surgery as well as to provide a correct differential diagnosis to distinguish this syndrome from other illnesses that involve gingival growth.
