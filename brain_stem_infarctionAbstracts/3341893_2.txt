Paroxysmal hypertension associated with diaphoresis and facial flushing occurs after brain injury and after spinal cord lesion above the level of sympathetic outflow. This excessive sympathetic activity is due to the failure of inhibitory impulses from supraspinal vasomotor centers to reach the spinal sympathetic outflow. A case of brainstem stroke, with weakness in all four extremities, is presented. The patient experienced paroxysms of hypertension with bladder spasms, which subsided after treatment of the spasms resulting from bladder infection. Serum levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were elevated during the episode and were normal after subsidence of the paroxysms.
