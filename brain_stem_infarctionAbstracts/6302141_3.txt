Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound were used to evaluate two patients with Klippel-Trenaunay (K-T) syndrome. Bowel and bladder hemangiomas were demonstrated in these cases. Computed tomography demonstrated multiple low attenuation areas in the liver and spleen in one case. Computed tomography is capable of noninvasively demonstrating bowel and bladder wall hemangiomas in K-T syndrome. Both CT and ultrasound may reveal silent lesions in the upper abdominal viscera, such as liver and spleen.
