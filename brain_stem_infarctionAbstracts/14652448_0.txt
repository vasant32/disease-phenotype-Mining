This is a case report of a lady who presented with pupil-sparing Weber's syndrome. She had left oculomotor nerve palsy with normal pupil and right hemiparesis. The patient subsequently made a good recovery. An ischemic lesion of the lower mid-brain was demonstrated on the MRI scan of the brain, which corresponds to the motor nucleus of the oculomotor nerve. The article also describes the neuroanatomy of the oculomotor nerve and how its partial lesions lead to sparing of the pupil. In addition, this case report documents that a pupil-sparing Weber's syndrome could be reversible.
