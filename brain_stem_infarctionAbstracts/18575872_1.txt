CASE REPORT: A subgaleal hematoma (SGH) occurred in a young patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) who was treated with aspirin after a mild head trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4-year-old child with SWS, who was chronically treated with aspirin at an antiplatelet dosage of 3 mg/kg per day, presented with extensive SGH and significant anemia after a mild head trauma. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: It is conceivable that the minor head trauma and chronic use of aspirin caused the SGH. Based on this event, the chronic use of aspirin in young patients with SWS, as suggested to prevent stroke-like episodes, is disputable.
