We present the case of a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) who underwent a one-stage revision of an infected total knee arthroplasty. A detailed orthopedic description of KT is presented as well as a discussion on the implementation of one-stage or multi-stage revision following infections of total knee arthroplasty. Due to vascular anomalies with severe coagulation problems, soft tissue swelling and increased risk of infection, surgical treatment of such patients presents a special challenge.
