The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome presents with a vascular nevus extending over an entire extremity, ipsilateral varicose veins dating from infancy and hypertrophy of all the tissues of the affected limb. This paper illustrates the problems that can be encountered in the management of this disorder. Congenital angiodysplasias should be suspected in all young individuals presenting with unilateral varicose veins. We recommend that modern methods of investigation be used in these cases to precisely define the anatomic pathology. In this manner, the appropriate treatment may be tailored to the patient's specific disorder.
