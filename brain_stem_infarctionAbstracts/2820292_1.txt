A case of hemihypertrophy associated with multiple anomalies of the skin, bone and visceral organs is presented. A 31-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of her skin conditions. Her family history is noncontributory, while her past history discloses operations for syndactyly of the right foot, tonsillar hypertrophy, anal prolapse and ovarial cyst. Erythemas of the face and the left upper extremity were noticed during the neonatal period and hypertrophy of the right side of the body started at age 2 months. On admission, hemihypertrophy was observed in the face, trunk and extremities. Multiple faint nevi flammei were seen on the right half of the face and on the left side of the trunk and extremities. Telangiectasis and nevus anemicus were seen in the upper chest. The left upper extremity showed diffuse brown patches that was histologically basal pigmentation with some giant melanosomes. Visceral anomalies consisted of fibromatous tumors of the tip of the tongue and mitral prolapse. Angiography and computed tomography revealed a possible arteriovenous malformation of the right occipital region, small hemangiomas around the patella, dilation of the lateral ventricle, and calcification of the choroid plexus. Tortuous superficial veins were noted in the right leg. She had no seizure, but her IQ was 68. The bone disorders consisted of scoliosis, short forth metacarpus, hypoplastic mandible and peroneal exostosis. Examination revealed a slight diminution of urinary corticosteroid, but no other endocrinological disorders were found. The hemihypertrophy in this case is at least partially due to an arteriovenous shunt, suggested by elevated oxygen saturation of the blood obtained from the internal saphenous vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
