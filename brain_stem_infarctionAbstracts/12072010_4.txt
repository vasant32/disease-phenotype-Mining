Klippel-Trenaunay (KT) syndrome is a vascular malformation characterized by a port-wine stain, varicose veins and hypertrophy of the affected limb. Ulceration is considered an uncommon complication of KT syndrome and occurrence of skin cancer has been previously reported only in one case. We observed a case of KT syndrome in a 48-year-old woman who developed a large ulcer and a squamous cell carcinoma on the affected leg.
