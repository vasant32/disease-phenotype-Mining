Sixteen patients having infarction caused by circulatory disturbance at the top of the basilar artery, that is to say, the "top of the basilar" syndrome, were studied, the diagnosis having been made by computerized tomography. Infarcts were widely distributed in each patient between the thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and occipital lobe. Both thalami were involved in 7 cases. When the thalamus was involved bilaterally, the low density areas were symmetrical in size and localization. Angiography revealed that stenosis or occlusion lay within a circle 2 cm in diameter surrounding the five-forked junction at the top of the basilar artery in 84.6%. Recanalization of the occluded artery occurred in 61.5%, suggesting that embolism played an important role in appearance of this syndrome.
