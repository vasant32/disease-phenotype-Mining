The pathogenetic role of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in embolic stroke and its prognostic and therapeutic implications have not yet been clearly defined. Nonetheless, recent availability of non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as the transcranial Doppler (TCD), has increased the frequency with which this anomaly is diagnosed. Here we present the case of a young woman affected by post-partum peripheral facial palsy: further exams disclosed not only its truncal-ischaemic origin, but also, significantly, the presence of PFO, as well as of anticardiolipin antibodies (acL). Given the increased embolic risk in labouring women, this study highlights the importance of searching for PFO in case of a stroke during pregnancy.
