In 3 patients, 2 women aged 56 and 57 and a 65-year-old man, who presented with overt and occult gastrointestinal bleeding, no focus of the bleeding could be found during gastroscopy and colonoscopy. The patients were then examined and treated by double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE). DBE is a relatively new endoscopic technique that allows high-resolution visualisation of the entire small intestine with full endoscopic instrumentation. The 56-year-old woman had coeliac disease and an enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma with stenoses over approximately 150 cm of bowel length. She was given chemotherapy and responded well. The 57-year-old woman suffered from Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome with multiple angiodysplasias in the small intestine. She was treated 5 times with argon plasma coagulation during DBE, for more than 40 angiodysplasias, and thereafter no longer needed blood transfusions. The 65-year-old man had a history of recurrent melanoma. During DBE, multiple metastases of a melanoma in the small intestine were found and tattooed. The tumours were later surgically excised, with no further metastases in the following 2 years. DBE has proven to be a good diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of small intestinal diseases.
