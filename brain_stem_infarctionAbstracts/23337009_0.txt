We report a patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome without facial angioma, who presented with seizures and normal initial imaging results. The patient experienced several years without seizures before a sudden increase in seizure frequency, followed by an atypical evolution of imaging findings prompting biopsy to establish the diagnosis. This case highlights not only the rare presentation of isolated leptomeningeal angiomatosis, but also the potential for atypical evolution of imaging findings through the course of the disease. We detail the imaging findings of our case and review the potential pathophysiological basis for this appearance. Our experience suggests that repeat imaging is warranted in patients with suspected Sturge-Weber syndrome or those with intractable cryptogenic epilepsy, because some imaging features of Sturge-Weber syndrome may manifest over time.
