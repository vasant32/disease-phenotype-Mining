Other than from the thalamus and sensory cortex, episodic pain is an extremely rare neurological manifestation in the central compartment. This study reports a middle-aged man who experienced an acute onset of episodic oscillatory burning pain restricted to the cheiro-oral region, who was found to have a singular infarct at the left tegmental pons. A close relationship between his pain attack and an elevation of arterial blood pressure was clearly observed. Blood adenohypophyseal hormones and electroencephalogram did not reveal an abnormality in the ictus. Neuroimaging and clinical studies did not support involvement of the thalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus or regional structure. Therefore, episodic pain may be an isolated manifestation with a pontine lesion. A relapsing expansion of focal cerebral oedema with fluid retention may have corresponded to the oscillation of his sensory deficit. This accumulating, devastating calamity by a repetitive and paroxysmal offense after a blood-brain barrier breakdown should be cautiously reviewed.
