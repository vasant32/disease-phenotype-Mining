Three patients with acute large paramedian ponto-mesencephalic infarctions developed a bilateral retrograde degeneration of the medial cerebellar peduncles within 4 months after the insult. In an initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the first 2 weeks, the medial cerebellar peduncles showed normal intensities, but a control MRI after 4 months showed bright hyperintensities in the T2-TSE weighted images, and moderately increased signal intensities in echo planar imaging-diffusion weighted imaging were seen, possibly representing bilateral Wallerian degeneration of the cerebellar-pontine fibers.
