A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a completely new output pathway that can provide an additional option for a person to express himself/herself if he/she suffers a disorder like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, brain or spinal cord injury or other diseases which impair the function of the common output pathways which are responsible for the control of muscles. For a P300 based BCI a matrix of randomly flashing characters is presented to the participant. To spell a character the person has to attend to it and to count how many times the character flashes. Although most BCIs are designed to help people with disabilities, they are mainly tested on healthy, young subjects who may achieve better results than people with impairments. In this study we compare measurements, performed on people suffering motor impairments, such as stroke or ALS, to measurements performed on healthy people. The overall accuracy of the persons with motor impairments reached 70.1% in comparison to 91% obtained for the group of healthy subjects. When looking at single subjects, one interesting example shows that under certain circumstances, when it is difficult for a patient to concentrate on one character for a longer period of time, the accuracy is higher when fewer flashes (i.e., stimuli) are presented. Furthermore, the influence of several tuning parameters is discussed as it shows that for some participants adaptations for achieving valuable spelling results are required. Finally, exclusion criteria for people who are not able to use the device are defined.
