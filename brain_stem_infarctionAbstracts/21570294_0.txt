Lasting taste disturbance has been previously reported as a consequence of brainstem infarction, but there are no previous reports of transient gustatory sensations preceding the onset of stroke. Ophthalmodynia, presenting as "salt-and-pepper" eye pain, has been reported rarely. We present a 58-year-old right-handed woman who had fluctuating ophthalmodynia and taste disturbance immediately preceding a left paramedian pontine infarction. We discuss the neuroanatomical basis of taste in reference to this presentation.
