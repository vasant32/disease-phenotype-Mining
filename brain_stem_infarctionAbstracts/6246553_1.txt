Two cases which were clinically typical of the Klippel Trenaunay syndrome and in which the integrity of the deep venous system demonstrated by phlebography form the basis for the author's discussion of the various theories and classifications which have been put forward up to now. The authors favour Schobinger's opinion, according to which three varieties of the Klippel Trenaunay syndrome are recognised. Malan's anatomoclinical classification has been adopted : this permits the grouping together of the numerous variations possible in this type of dysplasia.
