The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a disturbance in the development of the mesodermal and ectodermal tissues occurring in utero. It is characterized by the clinical triad of unilateral soft tissue and bone hypertrophy, varicosities and hemangiomas. For dentists the orofacial manifestations of the syndrome are interesting: unilateral hypertrophy of the maxilla and mandible, mandibular joint and alveolar processes and tooth germs. In addition, the gingival margins are thickened, eruption is premature and there is marked facial asymmetry.
