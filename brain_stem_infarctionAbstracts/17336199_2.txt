Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by cutaneous hemangiomata, venous varicosities and osseous soft tissue hypertrophy of the affected limb. We report a case of a patient with KTWS who had developed severe chronic, non-healing cutaneous ulcers resulting from several angiography procedures with embolization by various agents. The ulcers were treated with perilesional granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) with gratifying results. This case report suggests that GM-CSF may enhance the healing of chronic wounds not responding to other treatment modalities in patients with congenital angiodystrophy syndromes, thus salvaging a limb from amputation.
