Three cases with unusual manifestations of phakomatosis are reported. The first two had clinical symptoms of neurofibromatosis but CT disclosed nodular subependymal calcifications as in tuberous sclerosis. The third one presented with cerebral calcifications as found in both tuberous sclerosis and Sturge-Weber syndrome, though he had no clinical symptoms of phakomatosis.
