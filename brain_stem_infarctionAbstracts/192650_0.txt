The angiographic appearances and the significance of various angiographic signs are discussed in relation to 12 arteriovenous fistulae demonstrated angiographically in 11 patients. Dilatation of the supplying artery is an indication of the size of the shunt and is particularly prominent in the presence of multiple, congenital microfistulae. The technique developed in our clinic for investigating suspected or known A-V fistulae is described. This technique simplifies the differential diagnosis between the Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome and the prognostically less favourable Weber syndrome.
