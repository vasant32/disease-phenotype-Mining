A 16 years old male patient of Sturge-Weber syndrome was referred to glaucoma clinic for the management of unilateral glaucoma. There was also an ipsilateral hypermetropic shift. On detailed investigations, a diffuse choroidal haemangioma was diagnosed which induced this hypermetropic shift. Anisometropia in Sturge-Weber syndrome can give us clue regarding some underlying pathology, so unilateral myopia or hypermetropia should be thoroughly evaluated in such patients.
