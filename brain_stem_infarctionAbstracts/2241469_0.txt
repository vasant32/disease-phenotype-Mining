Upper occlusion of the basilar artery ("top of the basilar" syndrome) causes ischemics lesions in brainstem, thalamus and occipital and temporal lobes, producing visual, oculomotor and behavioral disorders, with slight motor affectation concomitant. We expose a case with a typical clinical setting and infarctions in thalamus and both occipital lobes with an unusual symmetric distribution.
