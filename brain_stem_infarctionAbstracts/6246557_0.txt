For the diagnosis of malformations of the lymphatics is made by the hyperlipidaemia test, which shows a flat total lipids curve without a post-prandial peak. Malformation of the lymphatics of the small intestine is responsible for exudative enteropathy, chyloperitoneum, chyluria, lymphoedema with reflux of lymph in the lymphatics of the legs and its complications (chylorrhagia, chylarthrosis), chylothorax, chylopericardium and reflux of lymph in the pulmonary lymphatics. This malformation can also be associated with other disorders : such as the syndrome of Klippel and Trenaunay, and simple lymphoedema of the limbs or genital organs. Lymphography of the intestinal lymphatics carried out during laparotomy after a fatty meal shows the state of the lymphatic vessels, a lack of injection of the cistern of Pecquet, and above all the presence of adventitious vessels allowing the lymph to reach the cervical region.
