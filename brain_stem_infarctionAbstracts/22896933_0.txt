 BACKGROUND: A 32-year-old woman developed altered consciousness two days after initial symptoms of acute otitis media, with purulent discharge from the right ear. She was quadriplegic, with spontaneous eye opening, mild neck stiffness, and lacking vestibular-ocular reflexes. METHODOLOGY: Upon admission, the patient was subjected to brain computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture. RESULTS: CT was consistent with pansinusitis, right middle ear otitis, mastoiditis, and sphenoiditis. No brainstem lesion was evident; brain MRI demonstrated ischemic and secondary hemorrhagic lesions in the pons and cerebral peduncles. The dura mater in the petroclival space was intensely inflamed, and likely responsible for reduced basilar arterial blood flow. Lumbar puncture yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid; gram stain examination was negative and culture remained sterile. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were cultured from the purulent ear discharge. CONCLUSION: The final diagnosis was locked-in syndrome consecutive to inflammatory changes compressing the basilar artery.
