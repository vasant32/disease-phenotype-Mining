This is an 11 month old girl who has been referred to our institute for a seizure disorder. Her physical examination showed angiomas on the left side of her face, and more extensive and prominent ones on her palms and soles. Her right face and arm were smaller than the left, associated with hypotonia and moderate weakness in the right forearm. Computerized tomography of head showed intracranial calcification in the left fronto-parietal region, and brain MRI, with gadolinium, revealed an extensive leptomeningeal angioma over the entire left hemisphere. This case was diagnosed as Sturge-Weber syndrome with unusual cutaneous manifestations.
