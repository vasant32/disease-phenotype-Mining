A case of multiple focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver occurring in a 22-year-old woman with musculoskeletal hemihypertrophy and anomalous vascular supply to the liver is described. The patient had Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome and abdominal pain and tender massive hepatomegaly. Visceral angiography showed marked dilatation of the celiac axis and both the main trunk and peripheral branches of the hepatic artery. Large abdominal veins drained from the dome of the liver into the hepatic veins. The vascular anomalies were evident on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple focal nodular hyperplasia was confirmed by laparoscopic liver biopsy. The findings in this patient support the concept that multiple focal nodular hyperplasia characteristically occurs in a syndromic form and is induced by an irregular arterial supply in the liver, with localized hyperfusion that leads to nodular areas of hepatocyte hyperproliferation.
