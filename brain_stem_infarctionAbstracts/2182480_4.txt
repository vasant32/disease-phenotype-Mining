In a retrospective study 30 eyes of 18 patients suffering from developmental glaucoma (primary congenital glaucoma, Sturge Weber syndrome, juvenile glaucoma) were examined after surgery. The mean follow-up period was 13 years. Eyeball length and anterior chamber depth were measured by means of echooculometry. Biometric data (echooculometry, corneal diameter, cup to disk ratio) were compared with psychophysic data (visual acuity, visual field). Up to an axial length of 26 mm, myopia caused by elongation of the eyeball is compensated by the weak refractive power of the large cornea. In cases with an eyeball length of more than 27 mm, excessive myopia was found. There is a linear correlation between corneal diameter and axial length of the eyeball. In all cases with an axial length of more than 27 mm only low vision was achieved. From our results can be concluded that 27 mm is the "critical" eyeball length which carries a grave prognosis. Due to the late (minimum 4 years) onset of the disease, all the operated eyes with Sturge Weber syndrome and juvenile glaucoma were in normal size.
