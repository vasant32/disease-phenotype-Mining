AIM OF THE STUDY: Clinical evaluation of patients with the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalotrigeminal angiomathosis) for establishing an accurate diagnosis and therapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The paper presents 5 cases of encephalotrigeminal angiomathosis (4 of them associating glaucoma) admitted in our clinic in the last 5 years, pointing out the peculiarities concerning the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutically aspects and outcome. RESULTS: The analysis of our cases showed that glaucoma does not correlate with the extension of skin lesion (nevus flammeus). The outcome of glaucoma's therapy is dictated by the adjustment of the therapy to the type of glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Glaucoma associated with the Sturge-Weber syndrome has always proved to be a therapeutic challenge and remains one of the causes of increased intraocular pressure, difficult to control. The management of glaucoma in Sturge-Weber syndrome includes surgical and drug therapy. These patients need long-term follow-up from the clinical and imagistic point of vue.
