BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dissecting vertebrobasilar aneurysms are challenging to treat, and standard treatment modalities remain controversial. We retrospectively evaluated our experience using endovascular techniques to treat these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 1997 to December 2007, 42 patients with intradural vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms underwent endovascular treatment. Twenty-nine patients had ruptured aneurysms, and 13 patients had unruptured dissecting aneurysms. The endovascular modalities for vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms were the following: 1) trapping (n = 30), 2) proximal occlusion (n = 3), 3) stent with coil (n = 6), and 4) stent alone (n = 3). RESULTS: Seventeen of the 29 patients with ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms had successful outcomes without procedural complications following endovascular treatment. Procedure-related complications were the following: 1) rebleeding (n = 3), 2) posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction (n = 6), 3) brain stem infarction (n = 2), and 4) thromboembolism-related multiple infarctions (n = 1). Clinical outcomes were favorable in 32 patients (76.1%). There were 3 (7.1%) procedure-related mortalities due to rebleeding, and 1 (2.4%) non-procedure-related mortality due to pneumonia sepsis. All 13 patients with unruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms had favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes without procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular procedures for treatment of unruptured symptomatic dissecting aneurysms resulted in favorable outcomes. Ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms are associated with a high risk of periprocedural complications. Risks can be managed by using appropriate endovascular techniques according to aneurysm location, configuration, and relationship with the PICA.
