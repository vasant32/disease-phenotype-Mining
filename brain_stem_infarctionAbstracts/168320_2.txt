Tuberous sclerosis and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber (KTW) syndromes are phakomatoses which are believed to be inherited separately. A 41 year old woman presented with the classic features of tuberous sclerosis: adenoma sebaceum, mental retardation, and seizures. In addition, the diagnostic triad of KTW involved the left lower limb: cutaneous naevi, a vascular anomaly, and osteohypertrophy. Arteriography documented the presence of visceral tumours and an arteriovenous malformation of the leg. This is the first reported association of the fully-developed symptomatology of tuberous sclerosis and KTW in one person.
