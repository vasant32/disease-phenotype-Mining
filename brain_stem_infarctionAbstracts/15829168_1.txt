We report the case of a 64-year-old man with sudden onset of numbness in the right hand and foot. Neurological examinations were normal except for hypersthesia, and hyperalgesia of the right hand and foot. Brain MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity on T2-weighted image and a low signal intensity on T1-weighted image in the left tegmetum of the pons. He was diagnosed with pontine infarction presenting with cheiro-pedal syndrome (CPS). Damage in the sensory pathways can cause CPS. Difference in the threshold may explain the specific sensory pattern in this syndrome. Further examination of the relationship between sensory symptoms and localization on MRI is needed to clarify this syndrome.
