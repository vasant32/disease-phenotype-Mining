We present a case of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) in Sturge-Weber syndrome in a 30-year-old woman with congenital port-wine stains on the left side of face involving the upper eyelid, cheek and the nose, and she had undergone facial hemangioma surgery 3 years ago suggestive of Sturge-Weber syndrome. She presented with a 1-month history of rapidly decreased visual acuity (VA) to counting fingers in the left eye which had no prior history of visual problem. And there was no evidence of glaucoma. At 3 months after the treatment of the standard photodynamic therapy (PDT) the VA was 20/200. For some reasons, we have no idea about the changes of tumor thickness and subretinal fluid. We confirmed the curative effect of PDT treatment for CCH because of the significantly improved VA in the bad eye.
