We describe a case of a 3-year-old girl with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome who presented with an enlarging abdominal mass caused by a serous borderline tumor of the fallopian tube. This case is notable for the rarity of this neoplasm in a premenarchal patient as well as the association with this syndrome. We briefly review these entities and the significance of malignancy in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.
