We report a case of a tiny infarct on the left dorsolateral pons in a 50-year-old man who presented with prolonged and isolated vertigo. The clinical features mimic vestibular neuritis and can easily lead to misdiagnosis. Selective involvement of the left superior vestibular nucleus might explain the resemblance to acute peripheral vestibulopathy.
