A 64-year-old man presented with alternating exotropia and bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) syndrome known as wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) syndrome. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed a small localized lesion in the median dorsal pons, and high-resolution T2-weighted imaging revealed slight left deviation of the lesion. A small penetrating artery was assumed to be occluded at the level of the MLF decussation. The median dorsal pons appears to be a location for the lesions causing WEBINO syndrome.
