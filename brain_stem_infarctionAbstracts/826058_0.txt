The author studied 189 patients with the main forms of phakomatosis (Louis-Barre syndrome, Sturge-Weber, Hippel-Lindau disease and Recklinghausens neurofibromatosis.) The use of pathogenetical treatment in the Louis-Barre syndrome (a transplantation of a neonatal thymus with the bone marrow) promoted an improvement in the clinico-immunological indices. A study of familial forms of the Louis-Barre syndrome and the Sturge-Weber disease demonstrated a similarity according to the main clinical indices among the sibs in 80% which may speak of the role of the genetical factors in the formation of the disease.
