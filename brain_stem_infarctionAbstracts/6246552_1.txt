Klippel's syndrome is due to a malformation of the deep veins. From 1944 to 1978 we have operated on 614 cases. In 51 % of these cases the malformation concerned the popliteal vein, in 16 % it concerned the superficial femoral vein, and in 25 % both veins were affected. We had only 3 % of iliac malformations and 1 % of inferior vena caval malformation. In the popliteal vein, ageneses and atresias were of equal incidence, but compressions by fibrous bands were much more frequent. In the femoral vein, compressions were most frequent, followed by atresias. Ageneses were very rare. In the iliac vein, atresias were twice as common as ageneses, whereas with the inferior vena cava we only found ageneses. The obstruction to the deep veins can be sectioned but one must also free the supplying vessels.
