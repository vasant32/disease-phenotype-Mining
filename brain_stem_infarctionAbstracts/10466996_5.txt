The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess mid-term results of valvuloplasty in patients presenting chronic recurring venous stasis ulceration. From 1988 to 1993, valvuloplasty was performed in the superficial femoral vein of 33 lower extremities in 28 patients presenting recurring ulceration. In 23 cases, previous surgery in the superficial venous system or perforating vein had failed. Preoperative work-up demonstrated primary deep venous insufficiency (PDVI) in 22 extremities (group I), proximal PDVI in association with distal postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) in 10 (group II), and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome in 1. Hemodynamic assessment with tourniquet placement demonstrated a mean venous return time of 9 sec (+10, -8). Descending femoral phlebography showed Kistner grade 4 in 30 cases. Outcome was evaluated by clinical examination and Dupplex scan with photophlethysmography at follow-up times ranging from 2 to 7.6 years (mean: 51 months). Correlation between outcome of valvuloplasty and clinical findings was excellent. The incidence of poor clinical and hemodynamic results was higher for patients with PTS. Valve repair in association with surgery for superficial vein insufficiency and ligation of perforators gives good results in patients with isolated PDVI.
