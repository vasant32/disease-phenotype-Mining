Klippel-Trenaunay-Syndrome is a rare congenital vascular malformation with cutaneous naevi, varicose veins and limb hypertrophy. We report a patient with a variant of this syndrome presenting with extensive varicose veins and arteriovenous shunts within the left arm, bony hypotrophy of the left hand, mucocutaneous melanin spots in the face and thrombocytopenia. Imaging techniques play a major role in making a diagnosis in angiophakomatoses.
