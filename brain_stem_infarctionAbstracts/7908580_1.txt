Intractable hiccup is a rare manifestation of a brainstem lesion. We present five cases of intractable hiccups associated with medulla oblongata lesions: three of these had brainstem infarction compatible with Wallenberg's lateral medullary syndrome; one, clinically probable multiple sclerosis with a medullary lesion; and one, choroid plexus papilloma of the fourth ventricle with medullary compression. Using magnetic resonance imaging, it was demonstrated that the lesions affecting the dorsal and/or lateral medulla oblongata were responsible for the intractable hiccups.
