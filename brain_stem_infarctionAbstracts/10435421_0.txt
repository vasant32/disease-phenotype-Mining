PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of trabeculotomy and guarded filtration procedure in the management of glaucoma associated with the Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Six patients (seven eyes) with Sturge-Weber syndrome who underwent glaucoma surgery were retrospectively reviewed. One patient had bilateral glaucoma. Age at the time of operation ranged between 23 days and 9 years. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 30.6 mmHg (range 25-38 mmHg). Trabeculotomy and guarded filtration procedure were performed in three eyes each and both techniques were used in one eye. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 6.3 (range 2-11) years. A single procedure lowered the intraocular pressure and arrested the progression of the disease in five eyes. Two patients required topical antiglaucoma medication. No patient needed reoperation. Two eyes suffered intra- and post-operative temporary choroidal effusions. CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculotomy in infancy and guarded filtration procedure in older children effectively stabilized the eyes and prevented further glaucomatous damage in our patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
