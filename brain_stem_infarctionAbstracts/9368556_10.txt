BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute brain infarction significantly decreases heart rate variability as a result of cardiovascular autonomic dysregulation. However, information regarding circadian rhythms of heart rate and heart rate variability is limited. METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed 24-hour circadian rhythm of heart rate and the time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability in 24 patients with hemispheric brain infarction, 8 patients with medullary brainstem infarction, and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. ECG data were obtained from the patients in the acute phase and at 6 months after the infarction. RESULTS: In the acute phase of stroke, all the components of heart rate variability, ie, standard deviation of RR intervals, total power, high-frequency power, low-frequency power, and very-low-frequency power, were similar at night (from midnight to 6 AM) and during the day (from 9 AM to 9 PM), indicating that the circadian oscillation of heart rate variability had been abolished. At 6 months after brain infarction, the circadian rhythm had returned and, as in the control subjects, the values at night were significantly higher than those in the daytime. The values in hemispheric and in brainstem infarction did not differ significantly from each other. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that circadian fluctuation of heart rate variability is reversibly abolished in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and that it returns during the subsequent 6 months. The loss of the relative vagal nocturnal dominance may contribute to the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiovascular complications after acute stroke.
