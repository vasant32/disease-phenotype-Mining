We present a case of a 62-year-old lady who was a known case of hereditary haemorrhagic telangectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome) and had pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). She had multiple embolisations of pulmonary AVMs. During the last embolisation therapy, one of the coils migrated into the heart. This could not be located by transoesophageal echocardiography, however, was identified in the left ventricle by computerised tomogram scan. It was removed successfully using cardiopulmonary bypass.
