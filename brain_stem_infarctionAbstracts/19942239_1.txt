Wallerian degeneration occurs after demyelination of the distal neuronal axons due to proximal damage of any type. We present the magnetic resonance findings in four patients with brainstem stroke and signs of Wallerian degeneration in the pontocerebellar tracts. We reviewed the magnetic resonance studies in four patients with subacute or chronic stage pontine lesions and the signal alterations at the level of the medial cerebellar peduncles. We correlated the findings in T2-weighted sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences with the time of evolution and etiology of the stroke.
