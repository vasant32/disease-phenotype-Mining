A case is presented of a rare anterior inferior cerebellar artery variant, originating from the internal carotid artery. This mimicked a cerebellar infarct on vertebral angiography of a patient who presented with dysmetria and gait imbalance. It is important for the neuroradiologist and neurointerventionist to be aware of common and unusual cerebellar arterial anatomic variants to avoid incorrect diagnoses, as well as understand possible implications for surgery and interventional therapies.
