Although swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) frequently occur in acute brainstem infarction, physiological studies of dysphagia (videofluoroscopy, manometry) are rarely reported. We present a patient with ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, palatal and laryngeal weakness, aphagia, and ipsilateral face and contralateral extremity pin and temperature loss due to lateral medullary infarction confined to the rostral dorsolateral medulla (RDM). Videofluoroscopy showed that the patient was unable to initiate a swallow. Manometry showed a markedly reduced peak pharyngeal pressure and weak pharyngeal contractions. Within 20 months, the patient's neurological deficits resolved, videofluoroscopy showed a normal swallow, and manometry showed normal peak pharyngeal pressure. Correlation of the clinical, physiological, and imaging evaluations shows that aphagia and severe bilateral pharyngeal paresis can result from unilateral RDM infarction. We suggest that, in man, the bilateral medullary swallowing centers function as one integrated center, and that infarction of a portion of this center is sufficient to cause complete loss of swallowing.
