PURPOSE: To assess the potential of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) as an adjunct to spin-echo sequences in evaluating the cerebral vascular anomalies seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Four pediatric patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome were evaluated with conventional MR imaging and with arterial and venous MRA. Resultant images were evaluated for evidence of volume loss, cortical enhancement, vascular anomalies, and enlarged choroid plexus. RESULTS: Venous MRA revealed reduced flow of the transverse sinuses and jugular veins, prominent deep collateral venous system, and a lack of superficial cortical veins. Arterial MRA, performed in all cases, revealed a reduced flow signal from the left middle cerebral artery in one hemiparetic patient and angiomatous changes of high branches of a middle cerebral artery in two patients. CONCLUSION: Arterial and, in particular, venous MRA can be useful adjuncts to standard spin-echo sequences in diagnosing Sturge-Weber syndrome.
