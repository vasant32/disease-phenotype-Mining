Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome is a rare congenital vascular disorder characterized by varicose veins, hypertrophy of the soft tissues and bones, and hemangiomas. Although colorectal angiomatosis is uncommon, this association can lead to life-threatening complications because of acute or chronic bleeding. We report a patient with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome who presented with transfusion-dependent anemia secondary to chronic rectal bleeding. Endoscopy and image studies revealed venous angiomata involving the rectum and distal sigmoid colon. We performed a laparoscopic ultralow anterior resection with intersphincteric dissection, obtaining good results. After a follow-up of 20 months the patient did not present hematochezia and maintained fecal continence.
