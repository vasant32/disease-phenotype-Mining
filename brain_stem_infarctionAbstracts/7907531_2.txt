We report a series of 13 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome anaesthetised on 17 occasions. Anaesthesia management varied depending on the clinical manifestations which ranged from localized, superficial skin lesions to extensive systemic involvement. These patients tolerate anaesthesia well but anaesthetic management includes evaluation for associated anomalies. Difficulty with intubation may occur due to angiomas of the mouth and upper airway. Anaesthesia should be planned to avoid trauma to the haemangiomata and increases in intraocular and intracranial pressure.
