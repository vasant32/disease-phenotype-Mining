At 20 weeks of gestation, a typical combination of a massive enlargement of the right fetal leg and multiple cystic lesions was detected at ultrasound examination. Color-coded Doppler examination revealed no arteriovenous fistulae. These findings allowed an in utero diagnosis of the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, which was confirmed after subsequent termination of the pregnancy. The severe malformation involved the upper and lower right leg. No arteriovenous fistulae were found.
