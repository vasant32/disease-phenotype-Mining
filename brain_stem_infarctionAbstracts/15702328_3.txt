PURPOSE: To report the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT) for exudative retinal detachment associated with diffuse choroidal haemangioma in Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: An interventional case report of a 12-year-old girl with Sturge-Weber syndrome who developed an exudative retinal detachment (visual acuity 20/400) that was treated with PDT under general anaesthesia. PDT was performed according to the standard (macular degeneration) protocol, using three nonoverlapping spots of 4,000 microm. RESULTS: Subretinal fluid resolved completely over a period of 5 months and visual acuity increased to 20/50. No side effects of the PDT treatment were encountered during 9 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION: In our patient PDT with verteporfin effectively resolved the exudative retinal detachment associated with a diffuse choroidal haemangioma. Resolution of subretinal fluid occurred over several months without retreatment. We noted no side effects of the combination PDT and general anaesthesia, nor did we encounter ocular side effects of the treatment.
