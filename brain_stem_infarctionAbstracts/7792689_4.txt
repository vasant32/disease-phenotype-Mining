BACKGROUND: Myelopathy in Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is uncommon but has been reported secondary to spinal vascular malformations. REPORT: A patient with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome who presented with spinal cord compression from a spinal extradural mass lesion (angiomyolipoma) is described. DISCUSSION: This association has not been reported previously but is consistent with the segmental vascular abnormalities observed in Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
