 BACKGROUND: The association of Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) with artery aneurysms is very rare. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 61-year-old man, diagnosed with left lower limb KTWS, presented with a venous ulcer and a popliteal aneurysm measuring 3.5 cm in diameter in the same limb. Endovascular treatment with covered stent was applied with good morphological and clinical results. CONCLUSION: We report a singular case of the association of a popliteal aneurysm with KTWS and its endovascular treatment. This treatment enabled exclusion of the popliteal artery aneurysm with safety and effectiveness and reduced the number of arteriovenous fistulas.
