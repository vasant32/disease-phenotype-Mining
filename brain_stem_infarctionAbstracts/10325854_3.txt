We describe the use of epidural analgesia for vaginal delivery of a parturient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome in whom the use of repeated magnetic resonance imaging during her obstetric care allowed us to see deep haemangiomata. This also allowed the safe sitting of an epidural catheter at L1-2 to provide analgesia for labour and delivery. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and the anaesthetic implications of the congenital vascular abnormalities and potential coagulopathy are discussed.
