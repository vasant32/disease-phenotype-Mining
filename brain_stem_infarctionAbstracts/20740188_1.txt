We present a rare case of Stewart-Treves syndrome characterized by a diffuse angiosarcoma of the leg in a 22-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphedema due to Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome. He underwent limb disarticulation and medical treatment with cycles of doxorubicin, oral thalidomide and sunitinib with a very good response after 12 months of follow-up.
