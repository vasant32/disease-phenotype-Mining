We present a case of a 48-year-old man who was initially thought to have had a brainstem stroke and was clinically 'locked-in'. Upon investigation, a petrous apex dural atriovenous fistula was identified causing profound brainstem venous hypertension. Surgical clipping lead to complete neurological recovery.
