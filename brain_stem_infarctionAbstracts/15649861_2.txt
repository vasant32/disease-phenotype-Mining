Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital malformation usually presenting limb asymmetry, abnormal development of the deep and superficial veins, and cutaneous capillary malformations. We describe the case of a 56-year-old male KTS patient who suffered from recurrent but life non-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed multiple extensive cavernous hemangiomas in the coecum and the ascending colon as well as the sigmoid colon and the rectum. MR imaging showed numerous dilated vessels within the left gluteal and inguinal region. The mucosal and the submucosal layers particularly of the sigmoid colon and rectum appeared markedly broadened and displayed high signal intensities in the STIR sequences. Due to only moderate oozing at time of admission the patient was treated with oral iron supplementation so far.
