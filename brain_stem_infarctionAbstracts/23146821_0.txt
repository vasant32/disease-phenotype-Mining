Background: Our clinical experience suggests that the outcome of cerebellum-brainstem ischemic strokes is better than that of hemispheric ischemic strokes. Methods: Within the setting of 2 national Israeli prospective stroke surveys, we analyzed risk factors, etiology, severity at presentation, and prognosis of first ischemic cerebellum-brainstem stroke (259 patients), comparing with strokes within the anterior circulation (1,029 patients). Results: Patients with cerebellum-brainstem strokes were younger and had less frequently atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Cardioembolic etiology was significantly less prevalent (p < 0.001). Severity at presentation was milder (p < 0.001). At discharge, worsening of the modified Rankin Scale was present in a smaller number of patients (p < 0.001); more returned to their home (p < 0.001). Six-month and 1-year mortality were lower (p < 0.001 for both). Adjusted logistic regression models showed that patients with cerebellum-brainstem strokes had 50% smaller chances of dying (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.31-0.98) and a smaller chance of worsening of the modified Rankin Scale at discharge (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46-0.82). Conclusions: Cerebellum-brainstem strokes are less frequently cardioembolic, have a less severe presentation, and carry a better immediate and long-term prognosis.
