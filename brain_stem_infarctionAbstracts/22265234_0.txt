Electric injury is a common physical injury in daily life. Because of the low resistance of vascular tissue, vascular injury and thrombosis are frequently found in cases of high-voltage electric injury but are rarely reported in low-voltage conditions. We present the case of a diabetic woman who suffered symptomatic brainstem stroke after a short duration of 60 Hz/110 V alternate current electric contact with a home washer socket. A stroke risk factor survey did not reveal remarkable cardiac or vascular abnormality, except increased glycohemoglobin levels and decreased protein C activity. In contrast to a direct and adequate energy transfer in high-voltage electric injury, a pre-existing vasculohemostatic deficit, such as coagulopathy, has been proposed to provide a predisposition to thrombosis in low-voltage electric injury. Nevertheless, the findings in this patient remind the possibility of physical triggering factor for stroke occurrence in our environment as new technology and product generates rapidly enough for understanding their safety and biologic effect.
