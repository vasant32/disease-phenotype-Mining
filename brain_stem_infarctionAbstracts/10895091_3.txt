Although hematuria has been reported in children with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, it is a rare presentation in the adult population. Two cases of massive hematuria in adults with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are reported here. A unique feature was venous malformations of the bladder which were responsible for massive recurrent bleeding in 1 patient. The clinical presentation and management are discussed. Conservative endoscopic and arteriographic control seems to be appropriate as initial management in these patients.
