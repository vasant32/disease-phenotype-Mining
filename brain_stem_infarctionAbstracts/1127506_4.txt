Calcium gluconate is irritating to soft tissues and can produce tissue necrosis and slough; Radiographs of the part following extravasation initially show only soft tissue swelling. A variable pattern of soft tissue calcification then develops in one to three weeks, and gradually is completely resorbed over several months' time. The cause of the soft tissue calcifications may be quite puzzling, if the incident of calcium gluconate extravasation has been overlooked.
