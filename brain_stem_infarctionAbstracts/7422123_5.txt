The vascular morphology and the abnormal angiographic flow patterns in an infant with Sturge-Weber cerebral angiomatosis are analyzed. A hypothesis explaining the occurence, dynamics and long term effects of these flow abnormalities is presented. It is concluded that a close angiographic evaluation, supplemented with other methods could, provide a basis for the establishment of valid indications for early surgical intervention and for the prognosis in general.
