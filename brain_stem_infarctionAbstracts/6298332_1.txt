Basing our observations on a study of 47 cases of angiodysplasia of types F.P. Weber, Klippel-Trénaunay and Servelle-Martorell, we attempted to demonstrate that differentiation of these 3 syndromes is possible if criteria obtained from a non-invasive investigative method are used. This involves taking standard X-rays of the extremities (both sides) which are examined under direct magnification (0.1-01 mm) thus allowing the most exact possible analysis of the skeletal changes. In this way, the Weber syndrome should be suspected if bone prolongation is seen in association with loss of substances from the skeleton. In the Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, the bone lengthening is not accompanied by bony lesions. In the Servelle-Martorell syndrome bony lesions go hand in hand with limb hypertrophy.
