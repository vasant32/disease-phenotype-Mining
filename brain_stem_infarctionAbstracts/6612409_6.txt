A case of brain stem infarction after chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine is presented. Proposed mechanisms and sites of possible arterial injury are discussed. A diagnosis of vertebral artery occlusion was made using conventional brachial angiography. Digital intravenous angiography, a relatively new and less invasive vascular imaging technique which was used as an adjunct for evaluating the remainder of the cervicocephalic vessels, documented the vertebral occlusion. Chiropractic manipulation, which is increasing in popularity, may be a cause of potentially devastating neurologic disease.
