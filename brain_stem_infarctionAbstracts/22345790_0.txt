Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare sporadic condition of mesodermal phakomatosis, characterized by purple-colored flat cutaneous cranial (face) hemangiomas (most commonly along the trigeminal nerve), glaucoma and vascular lesions in the ipsilateral brain and meninges. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is also an uncommon mesodermal phakomatosis characterized by a triad of cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas, venous varicosities and soft tissue or bone hypertrophy. Sturge-Weber syndrome in combination with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is unusual. Because of the rarity, we report here a 3-year-old boy who presented with overlapping features of both the syndromes.
