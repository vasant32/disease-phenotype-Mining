We report a rare case showing Weber's syndrome associated with supranuclear vertical gaze palsy caused by the ipsilateral lesion of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), which is regarded as the supranuclear control center of vertical gaze. To date, no literature concerning Weber's syndrome associated with the ipsilateral riMLF lesion was documented. The patient was a 53-year-old female, who suddenly developed unconsciousness and left-sided weakness. Neurological findings on admission revealed right third nerve palsy, severe supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, almost complete convergence palsy, left hemiparesis and hyperreflexia with positive Babinski's sign on the left side. There was no sign of pupillary disturbance or no abnormality of the horizontal movements of the left eye. The vestibulo-ocular reflex of the left eye was preserved. There was no sensory disturbance. Cranial MRI had the advantages in demonstrating unilateral ischemic lesions at the cerebral peduncle and the thalamomesencephalic junction involving the unilateral riMLF on the right side. Recent reports have demonstrated that supranuclear vertical gaze palsy is caused by the unilateral riMLF lesion. We confirm that the unilateral riMLF lesion causes supranuclear vertical gaze palsy in our case and that cranial MRI has the advantages in demonstrating the specific lesion.
