Using the previously reported method of experimental localized brainstem infarct in dogs, we designed this study to elucidate sequential changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in three separate regions of the central nervous system: the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and midbrain. The data obtained were referred to in subsequent investigations of cerebrovascular autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity to CO2. Localized brainstem infarct was produced by permanently occluding the perforators of the posterior cerebral arteries between the bilateral origins of the posterior communicating arteries. The hydrogen clearance method was applied to measure rCBF. Cerebrovascular autoregulation and CO2 reactivity were assessed in three regions 1, 3, and 5 h after vascular occlusion, respectively. Vascular occlusion resulted in a decrease of rCBF that was 65% in the midbrain and close to 30%-40% in the thalamus. However, no significant change was seen in the cerebral cortex even 5 h after vascular occlusion. Induced hypertension impaired autoregulation in the thalamus, while it was preserved in the cerebral cortex. Induced hypotension did not alter autoregulation in any of the three regions. A marked loss of CO2 reactivity was observed in the ischemic brainstem, although it was well preserved in the cerebral cortex. The results suggest that noradrenergic fibers originating from the cervical sympathetic ganglia play a main role in the cerebrovascular autoregulation in the cerebral cortex, while noradrenergic fibers possibly originating from the autonomic centers in the brainstem are responsible in the thalamus; that the noradrenergic neuron probably is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow during hypotension; and that the effect of CO2 is mediated by its direct effect on the arteriolar wall in the central nervous system.
