A 13-year-old girl with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and intradural extramedullary spinal arteriovenous fistulas is presented. Pre-embolization balloon test occlusions and embolization with platinum fibre coils were carried out in three sessions, after which the myelopathy and the intense back pain disappeared. Our conclusion is that spinal fistulas can be safely and effectively treated with fibre coils in combination with balloon testing.
