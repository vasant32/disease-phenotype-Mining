Sturge-Weber Syndrome is a nonheritable congenital syndrome characterized by a "port-wine stain" on the face and angioma of the meninges. Ocular findings include diffuse choroidal hemangioma, retinal detachment, and various types of glaucoma. Management of diffuse choroidal hemangioma is aimed at preserving the affected eye and preventing glaucoma. In the past this has been challenging. Herein, we describe a case of Sturge-Weber Syndrome with diffuse choroidal hemangioma which was successfully treated with low dose lens-sparing external beam radiotherapy.
