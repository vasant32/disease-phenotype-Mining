CONCLUSION: There is evidence of an inverse association between cerebral infarction and tinnitus in this study. The effects of cerebral infarction on tinnitus could be explained by a neurophysiological model of tinnitus. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between tinnitus and brain MRI findings including cerebral infarction, brain atrophy, ventricular dilatation, and white matter lesions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based study of 2193 subjects aged 41-82 years living in Aichi prefecture, Japan. Detailed questionnaires, pure tone audiometry, and brain MRI were performed. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders in a multiple logistic analysis, cerebral infarction was inversely associated with tinnitus (odds ratio (OR)=0.649, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.477-0.884). Cerebral infarctions of the basal ganglia (OR=0.542), thalamus (OR=0.441), and pons (OR=0.319) were especially associated with tinnitus. Brain atrophy, ventricular dilatation, and white matter lesions had no significant effects on the prevalence of tinnitus.
