Five patients (six limbs) with Parkes-Weber's syndrome (PWS) are reported. Three male (four limbs) and two female (two limbs) patients presented with classic Klippel-Trenaunay's triad of hypertrophy of extremity, hemangioma and varicosity in company with evidence of functional arteriovenous fistulae. The ascending phlebography revealed dilated deep venous trunks together with segmental narrowness. The dilatation of arterial trunks and arteriovenous shunts or diffusely branching arteriovenous malformations combined with early filling of the veins were demonstrated by arteriography. Four patients (four limbs) were surgically treated with good results. One patient (two limbs) was managed with elastic support, and his symptoms was partially controlled.
