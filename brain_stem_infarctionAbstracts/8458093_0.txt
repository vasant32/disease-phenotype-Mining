During the examination of 210 eyes with blue irises by fluorescein angiography a few unusual vascular formations of the course, filling and caliber were revealed. Authors have divided them into four groups by similar angiographic pictures. Possible capillary haemangioma in connection with syndrome Sturge-Weber from the third group and angioma racemosum from the fourth group of examined irises are considered to be abnormal vessels. It is possible to state diagnosis by fluorescein angiography in many cases even without histological examination and to follow the dynamics of their possible development.
