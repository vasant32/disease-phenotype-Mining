The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare disorder in which the congenital vascular anomalies can affect the urogenital tract. Several cases of hemorrhage from the urogenital system have been reported in children with this condition. We report an upper renal tract hemorrhage in an adult, which required nephrectomy. To our knowledge this condition has not been reported previously in an adult with the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. We discuss the condition, and its diagnosis, treatment and relevance to the urogenital tract.
