A case of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) associated with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is described. A 58-year-old man with chronic renal failure experienced urinary retention following gross hematuria. Intermittent drainage was necessary for significant urination for five days. Thereafter his urinary retention was relieved, but renal failure progressively developed and hemodialysis was started. Right hydronephrisis and hydroureter disappeared one month later. In spite of relief of obstruction, of which the cause was likely blood clots, renal function was not restored. Obstructive nephropathy was most likely explicable for notable deterioration in renal function. Our case might have susceptibilities to PKD development in terms of angiogenesis.
