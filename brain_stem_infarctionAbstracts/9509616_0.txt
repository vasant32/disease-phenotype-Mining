Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital vascular abnormality consisting of a cutaneous naevus, varicose veins and bone and soft-tissue hypertrophy affecting one or more limbs. A case is presented here with some unusual associated findings seen on MR that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. Although colour Doppler in addition to venography is frequently used in demonstration of the KT vein, MRI may well have an important role in complete assessment.
