Two cases of tuberous sclerosis are presented. Extensive superficial occipital calcifications were found as classically described in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Other radiologic signs of tuberous sclerosis, such as subependymal calcifications in both patients and surgically proved giant cell astrocytoma in one patient, were present. At pathologic examination, the calcifications appeared to be located in extensive cortical tubers.
