This case involves a 28-year-old man suffering from severe circulatory failure with blue and cold limbs resulting from childhood polio and showing circumscribed plaques of angio-dermatitis (Favre and Chaix) with a tumor-like appearance resembling Kaposi's angiosarcomatosis. These facts described by Mali in circulatory ailments, especially following phlebitis, should be known to phlebologists. They differ from Kaposi-like disease by the much rarer arterio-venous fistula (described by Bluefarb and Stewart). It is possible that there are mixed forms and that the cases attributed to simple circulatory failure may be due to the minimal linkage of arterio-venous fistulas that can be detected only by arterio-selection.
