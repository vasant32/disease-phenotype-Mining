PURPOSE: The Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by benign excessive growth of blood vessels on the skin. Little is still known about its cognitive development and adaptive behaviour functioning. CASE STUDY: This case study describes the clinical history of a female child suffering from this rare syndrome and admitted to our Pediatric Unit in order to provide motor rehabilitation, speech therapy and psychoanalytic psychotherapy following an early intervention model program. After five years of treatment her clinical picture witnessed a considerable improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome are best served by a multidisciplinary approach, and this case study shows the effectiveness of an early intervention program on the cognitive development and adaptive behaviour functioning.
