The authors recall that the syndrome of Klippel and Trenaunay, which in its typical form most commonly involves a lower limb, constitutes the best known example of the angiodysplastic disorders, and go on to describe the case of a patient with extensive congenital varicose veins of the left upper limb, with slight bone hypertrophy and changes in the limb skeleton. In the varicose veins were numerous phleboliths, and phlebography revealed agenesis of the deep veins of the forearm. In discussion they try to demonstrate the diagnostic difficulties of this disorder which may suggest a phlebo-angiomatosis, a "pure" phlebodysplasia or an atypical Klippel and Trenaunay syndrome.
