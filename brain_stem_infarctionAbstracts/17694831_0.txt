A two-stage antiglaucoma operation was planned for the left eye of an 11-year-old boy with bilateral Sturge-Weber syndrome to avoid intraoperative and postoperative choroidal and retinal effusion as with previous trabeculectomy. The Ex-Press miniature glaucoma implant was placed 10 days before trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. There were no complications with either procedure.
