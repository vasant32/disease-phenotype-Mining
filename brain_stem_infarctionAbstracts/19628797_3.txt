BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical-imaging correlation and long-term clinical outcomes remain to be investigated in medial medullary infarction (MMI). METHODS: We studied clinical, MRI, and angiographic data of 86 consecutive MMI patients. The lesions were correlated with clinical findings, and long-term outcomes, divided into mild and severe (modified Rankin scale >3), were assessed by telephone interview. Central poststroke pain (CPSP) was defined as persistent pain with visual numeric scale > or = 4. RESULTS: The lesions were located mostly in the rostral medulla (rostral 76%, rostral+middle 16%), while ventro-dorsal lesion patterns include ventral (V, 20%), ventral+middle (VM, 33%), and ventral+middle+dorsal (VMD, 41%). Clinical manifestations included motor dysfunction in 78 patients (91%), sensory dysfunction in 59 (73%), and vertigo/dizziness in 51 (59%), each closely related to involvement of ventral, middle, and dorsal portions, respectively (P<0.001, each). Vertebral artery (VA) atherosclerotic disease relevant to the infarction occurred in 53 (62%) patients, mostly producing atheromatous branch occlusion (ABO). Small vessel disease (SVD) occurred in 24 (28%) patients. ABO was more closely related to VMD (versus V+VM) than was SVD (P=0.035). During follow-up (mean 71 months), 11 patients died, and recurrent strokes occurred in 11. Old age (P=0.001) and severe motor dysfunction at admission (P=0.001) were factors predicting poor prognosis. CPSP, occurring in 21 patients, was closely (P=0.013) related to poor clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: MMI usually presents with a rostral medullary lesion, with a good clinical ventro-dorsal imaging correlation, caused most frequently by ABO followed by SVD. A significant proportion of patients remain dependent or have CPSP.
