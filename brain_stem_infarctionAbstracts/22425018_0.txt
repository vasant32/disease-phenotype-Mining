 OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) with acute brainstem infarctions (BSIs) and to determine whether HbA1c is an independent risk factor in BSIs patients. METHODS: 96 only BSIs patients were categorized into four groups according to HbA1c as <6%, ≥ 6% but <7%, ≥ 7% but <8%, or ≥ 8%, respectively. The association of the four HbA1c groups with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volumes (DIV), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and follow-up modified Rankin Scale (FmRS) scores were analyzed. Patients also were categorized into two groups according to HbA1c<6% or ≥ 6%. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between HbA1c and DIV (Spearman ρ=0.339, P=0.001), NIHSS scores (ρ=0.292, P=0.004) and FmRS scores (ρ=0.315, P=0.002). The incidence of pons infarction was highest in BSIs and patients with HbA1c ≥ 6% showed significantly more frequent isolated pontine infarction. Logistic regression analyses showed that only HbA1c was independently associated with larger DIV (P=0.025) and FmRS scores (P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that elevated HbA1c level may be a potential serologic marker in the evaluation of the severity and prognosis of acute BSIs. There is an urgent need to study control of diabetes mellitus (DM) before and after BSIs.
