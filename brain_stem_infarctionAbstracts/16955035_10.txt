OBJECTIVE: The surgical management of occlusive hydrocephalus caused by massive cerebellar infarction remains controversial. The procedures that are more commonly used to avoid progressive neurological deterioration are based on transient external ventricular drainage or the placement of permanent shunt systems. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding using endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in patients with an occlusive hydrocephalus caused by cerebellar ischemic stroke. We report our experience of 10 reviewed cases. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2004, 10 patients with a resulting hydrocephalus caused by a space-occupying cerebellar infarction were managed with ETV. Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, cause of stroke, and computed tomographic signs, including the ischemic vascular territory involved and brain edema, were noted. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS: In all patients, there was a mean interval of 4 days from the onset of deterioration of consciousness to operation. Mean Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 11.2. In nine patients, ETV was the initial procedure of ventricular drainage. One patient was primarily treated with an external ventricular drainage, but the device dislocated and ETV was performed. In one patient, an external ventricular drainage became necessary 7 days after the initial ETV because of a malfunction of the stoma. One patient showed a progressive brain edema 2 days after ETV, and suboccipital decompression was performed. Eight successfully treated patients demonstrated an improvement in the level of consciousness after ETV. Mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge of all patients was 3.4. CONCLUSION: Occlusive hydrocephalus caused by cerebellar infarction is infrequent. When occlusive hydrocephalus is observed, ETV can be used successfully with minimal risks, especially with avoidance of a higher rate of infectious complications caused by external drainage systems.
