 INTRODUCTION: Dorsal midbrain syndrome (DMS) is characterized by upgaze paralysis, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and eyelid retraction. Impaired downgaze and pupillary light-near dissociation may co-exist, while less common features including exotropia and convergence paralysis have also been described. However, loss of motor fusion is not a well recognised finding in DMS. PURPOSE: To describe DMS associated with loss of motor fusion. METHODS: Retrospective case series. RESULTS: Five patients (age 21-80 years) presented with features of DMS due to severe head injury (n=1), brainstem stroke (n=3) and pinealoma (n=1). All five complained of constant diplopia with horizontal and vertical separation and had an exotropia (range 20Δ to 70Δ), absent convergence and motor fusion. Two underwent strabismus surgery and subsequently had a variable improvement in their motor fusion. The remaining three patients were managed with occlusion. CONCLUSION: This case series illustrates the complexity of ocular motility findings associated with DMS and highlights the potential difficulties in the management of patients with loss of motor fusion.
