Photographs of the optic nerve head (optic disc) in the eye are used for the clinical assessment of the disease glaucoma. These images are usually subjectively assessed by a clinician. A case of Sturge-Weber Syndrome which includes glaucoma as a symptom, is presented here. Narrowing of the rim of the optic disc was measured using custom-made measurement software confirming glaucomatous progression. To maximize the information obtained from optic disc images, low cost software can assist with quantifying disc parameters aiding clinical interpretation.
