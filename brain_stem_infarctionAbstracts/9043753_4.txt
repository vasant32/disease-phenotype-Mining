 BACKGROUND: Complex auditory hallucinations have rarely been reported in cases of brainstem stroke or tumor. METHOD: Case study. RESULTS: A patient with acute Listeria rhombencephalitis complained of formed musical auditory hallucinations on the side of recent sensorineural deafness. MRI revealed an abscess in the middle cerebellar peduncule with extensive surrounding edema. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of brainstem auditory pathways may cause complex auditory hallucinations. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed and a diagnostic approach is proposed.
