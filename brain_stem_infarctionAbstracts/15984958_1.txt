Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital disorder characterized by triad of vascular nevi, venous varicosities and hyperplasia of soft and hard tissues in the affected area. This syndrome usually affects the extremities but occasionally can manifest in the craniofacial region, including the oral cavity. We report a case of KTS and discuss the oro-surgical and dental considerations regarding hemorrhagic tendencies caused by the known local anomalies such as vascular malformations associated with this syndrome as well as systemic abnormalities.
