We report the prenatal identification of lower-limb venous hypoplasia to support a provisional prenatal diagnosis of Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome (KTS). Ultrasound assessment of a fetus with marked lower-limb edema, cystic areas in the abdomen/pelvis/lower limbs and abnormal development of the feet demonstrated bilateral hypoplasia of the femoral and popliteal veins. The external iliac veins and the great saphenous veins were seen to be normal. The lower limb arterial system was present. These findings supported KTS as the most likely provisional diagnosis, and postnatal clinical evaluation confirmed that the infant is best classified in the spectrum of KTS. Venous hypoplasia was confirmed with a postnatal ultrasound examination of the lower limbs. This case suggests that careful examination of the lower-limb venous system may be helpful in making the prenatal diagnosis of KTS.
