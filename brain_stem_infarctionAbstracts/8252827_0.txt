A 49-year-old woman with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTW) is reported. She had characteristic features of KTW; cutaneous angiomas on her back, left knee and both plantae, varicosities on both legs, and hypertrophy of the left leg. In addition she had rare complications of KTW; asymmetric skull bone, hemicranial hypertrophy, kyphosoliosis, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, and abnormal length of the dactyl. Her hemicranial hypertrophy was examined by CT scan, MRI and angiography. Her right hemicranial volume was enlarged and her left lateral ventricle was enlarged. The T2-weighted MRI imaging demonstrated high signal intensity beside the right lateral ventricle and in the right basal ganglia. Cerebrovascular anomalies were not revealed. She also had neurological manifestations of KTW that are rarely seen in adult cases; mental retardation, and myelopathy. The anti-HTLV-I antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were positive, so it was thought for her to have HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM). She was treated with peroral prednisolone and alpha-interferon (intramuscular), which improved her ability to walk. It is known that kyphosis sometimes makes the disorder of spinal cord. Although KTW is known to be associated with the spinal arteriovenous malformation, several examinations did not reveal the spinal vascular anomalies in this case. So we think the myelopathy of this case was caused mainly by the kyphoscoliosis and HAM.
