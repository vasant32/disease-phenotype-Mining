A 78-year-old man suffered from refractory aspiration pneumonia as a result of a minor medullary stroke. The only neurological symptom observed in this patient was difficulty in swallowing. He was managed with i.v. hyperalimentation with termination of oral intake, including water. However, he still experienced several episodes of aspiration pneumonia. As he was considered to have a bacterial infection because of silent aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal material, inhalation of tobramycin was introduced and successful control of airway infection was attained.
