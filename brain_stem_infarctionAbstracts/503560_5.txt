A patient rendered acutely quadriplegic in an automobile accident was shown by angiography to have occlusion of the left vertebral artery. One month later, he abruptly became unconscious, apneic and died. Autopsy showed an organised thrombus in the left vertebral artery and a fresh thrombus occluding the entire basilar artery. This case differs from previously reported cases of traumatic vertebral artery thrombosis wherein symptoms of brain stem infarction were more immediately evident.
