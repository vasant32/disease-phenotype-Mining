We reported a sixty-year-old man who developed acquired stuttering after a brainstem infarction. Infarctions were detected in the midbrain and upper pons. Neurogenic stuttering of this patients indicated that the midbrain and upper pons could be lesion sites responsible for acquired stuttering. We speculated that the reticular network extending from the brainstem to the frontal cortices, and the periaqueductal gray matter could be closely related regions generating neurogenic stuttering.
