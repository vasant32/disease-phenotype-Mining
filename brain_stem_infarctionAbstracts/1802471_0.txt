We report a case of a 47-year-old man with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome associated with subdural hematoma. The patient had several episodes of arthritis during his thirties. He developed venous thrombosis in his right lower leg at the age of 35, when laboratory studies demonstrated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a biological false-positive result occurred on a syphilis test. When bulbar palsy and Horner's syndrome in the right eye suddenly appeared at the age of 42, he was diagnosed as having brain stem infarction. At the age of 47, he developed constructional apraxia, dyscalculia, skilled movement disturbances and generalized convulsions. Subdural hematoma and multiple lacunes in the cerebral white matter were demonstrated with brain MRI. Furthermore, the patient was positive for Rumpel-Leede phenomenon. Laboratory studies revealed mild thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding time and APTT, positive antinuclear antibody and positive test results for both lupus anticoagulant and an anti-cardiolipin antibody, namely anti-phospholipid antibodies. Based on these findings, we consider that the tendency of this patient to bleed may have been due to antiphospholipid antibodies, attacking the platelet membranes and that the bridging veins in the subdural space may be the site at which the bleeding tendency easily appears. Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome accompanied by hemorrhagic complications had rarely been reported. We suggest that special attention should be given to hemorrhagic complications in patients with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome associated with fragility of the vessels and/or platelet dysfunction.
