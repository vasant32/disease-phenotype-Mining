PURPOSE: To determine if latanoprost reduces intraocular pressure in eyes with glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in which eyes with uncontrolled intraocular pressure associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome were treated with latanoprost 0.005% once daily. All eyes were already receiving at least two other antiglaucoma medications. Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline and after treatment for at least 1 month. All intraocular pressure measurements were taken within 24 hours of drug instillation. RESULTS: Six eyes of six patients received latanoprost. Two (28%) of the six eyes demonstrated an intraocular pressure decrease that averaged 8.8 mm Hg. These two responders had juvenile onset glaucoma, whereas the four nonresponders had congenital onset glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost may significantly reduce intraocular pressure in selected patients with glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
