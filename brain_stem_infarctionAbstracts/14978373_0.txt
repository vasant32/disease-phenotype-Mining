Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is a congenital vascular disorder consisted of a variety of vascular malformations, enlargement of the involved limb, and varicose veins. We report a case of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome presenting portal hypertension and varices bleeding caused by hypoplasia of the portal vein. Portal hypertension was caused by portal vein hypoplasia associated with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. There were three episodes of variceal bleeding, and hemostasis were achieved by endoscopic band ligation, Sugiura operation, and splenic artery embolization respectively. Although successful hemostasis was achieved, an additional procedures to reduce portal hypertension were needed to prevent repeated episodes of variceal bleeding.
