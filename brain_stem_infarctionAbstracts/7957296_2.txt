Colour Doppler ultrasound was used to study the affected lower limbs of a group of patients with the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. The abnormal lateral venous channel characteristic of this syndrome was examined, together with its deep venous connections and deep venous patency established if present. Seventeen patients (18 limbs) were studied. Ultrasound demonstrated calf vein patency in 15 out of 17 limbs and deep venous patency from the popliteal vein to the inferior vena cava in 17 out of 17 limbs. Ultrasound was also effective in demarcation of the abnormal lateral venous channel, together with its deep connections (13 out of 16 limbs). We conclude that ultrasound is superior to the more established venographic techniques in the investigations of patients with the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. From this study, the deep venous aplasia said to occur in the condition would appear to be less common than previously thought.
