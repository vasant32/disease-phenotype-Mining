Talon cusp is an uncommon developmental anomaly affecting the anterior teeth, characterized by cusp-like projections, usually presenting on the lingual surface of the affected tooth. The occurrence ranges from 0.73% to 8% of the population. Talon cusp has been associated with other dental anomalies such as dens invaginatus, odontomas, and impacted teeth; associations with somatic anomalies such as Mohr's, Rubenstein-Taybi, and Sturge-Weber syndromes have also been reported. Only a few cases of labial talon cusp have been reported and only one previously published report exists documenting talons appearing both labially and lingually on the same tooth. This study reports the unusual case of a 10-year-old girl with bilateral talon cusps and one tooth possessing both lingual and labial talons. The lingual talon on the right maxillary lateral incisor was interfering with normal occlusion and was responsible for labioversion of the tooth. Treatment options were presented.
