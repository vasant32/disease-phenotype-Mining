We describe the prenatal sonographic findings in a case of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome including fetal ascites and subcutaneous cystic lesions associated with a relatively low level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and a relatively high level of maternal serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin. Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome may present prenatally with fetal ascites and an abnormal maternal serum screening result in addition to fetal limb hypertrophy and subcutaneous cystic lesions.
