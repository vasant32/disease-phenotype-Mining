Central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (CAH), or Ondine's curse, is a very rare disease characterized by dysfunction of respiratory center in the brain stem. Here, we report a case of CAH associated with cerebral infarction. A 59-year-old man developed right facial sensory deficit at age 56. Then, the facial sensory deficit spread to the left side and dysarthria and dysphagia also developed. Since age 58, he often developed respiratory failure and consciousness disturbance. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed alveolar hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis. Disorders of peripheral organs such as lung, airway, thorax and neuromuscular diseases were ruled out. Brain MRI showed cerebral infarction in the brain stem. We diagnosed him as CAH associated with brain stem infarction.
