The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare syndrome characterised by the triad of varicose veins, bony and soft tissue hypertrophy, and cutaneous haemangioma. A 30 year old man with KTS with a right mediastinal mass which progressively enlarged over 5 years is described. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bronchial angiography revealed a vascular lesion in the azygous area. After complete excision of the mass, histological examination revealed cavernous haemangioma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intrathoracic haemangioma in KTS.
