Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder characterised by congenital vascular hamartomas, limb hypertrophy, lymphangiomas and atresia of lymph vessels with non-pitting oedema. A 6-year-old girl with KTS was referred to our hospital for evaluation of intractable seizures. In addition to findings consistent with KTS, we also found hemimegalencephaly, retroperitoneal lymphangioma and double inferior vena cava. All of these associations in the same patient with KTS are unique in the English literature. We report on the multidedector CT and MRI features of such an unusual case.
