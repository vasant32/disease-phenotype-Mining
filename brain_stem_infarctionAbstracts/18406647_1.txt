Neurofibromatosis types 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2) are genetically distinct conditions caused by mutations in tumour suppressor genes that share a number of phenotypic features. Childhood stroke and vasculopathy have been associated with NF1, but not with NF2. We describe a case of brainstem stroke in a child with NF2.
