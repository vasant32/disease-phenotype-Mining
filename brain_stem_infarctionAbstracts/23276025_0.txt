Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is a genetic disorder resulting in mucosal and celiac angiodysplastic lesions. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman with Rendu-Osler-Weber disease manifesting with telangiectasias on the skin and mucosa of the face and pulmonary and hepatic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Due to cardiovascular and neurological (recurrent brain abscess) complications of pulmonary AVMs, the patient was qualified for the embolization of a recanalized AVM in the right lung. Endovascular embolotherapy is the method of choice in treatment of pulmonary AVMs allowing for avoidance of complications and prolonged survival. Due to the risk of recanalization of embolized AVMs, a long-term follow up is necessary.
