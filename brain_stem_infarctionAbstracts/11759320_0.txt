We report three cases of delivery in two parturients with a Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. These patients have a rare hereditary disorder that results in three main features: haemangiomas, varicose veins, bone and soft tissue hypertrophy. In the absence of angiographic magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord and of perispinal tissues, arteriovenous malformations of the central nervous system could not been ruled out. Intravenous sufentanil and pudendal block were used for labour analgesia and vaginal delivery respectively; general anaesthesia was used for uterine revision and for caesarean section.
