A 44-year-old woman with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) was evaluated for an adrenal mass incidentally discovered on CT. An NP-59 scintigraph showed normal symmetric adrenal tracer uptake, and a Tc-99m labeled RBC scan showed no evidence for an adrenal hemangioma but did show characteristic dilated and tortuous vasculature at multiple other sites. The mass was removed and found to be an adrenal pseudocyst. The pseudocyst was believed to have arisen from a pre-existing, thrombosed and organized adrenal hemangioma. This case demonstrates the previously reported utility of RBC scintigraphy in the depiction of the vascular abnormalities in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, as well as the utility of NP-59 scintigraphy in evaluating patients with adrenal masses.
