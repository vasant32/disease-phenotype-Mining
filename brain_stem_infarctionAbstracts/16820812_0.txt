Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is a rare congenital malformation that may include port-wine stain, soft tissue and bony hypertrophy, and venous malformations and lymphatic abnormalities. Although it usually involves the limbs, it may also rarely involve the head, neck, and orofacial regions. Despite its rarity, Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gingival enlargement. The condition can be easily recognized clinically, but further investigations including imaging studies have to be carried out in order to better understand the nature of the lesion. This report describes a case of gingival enlargement in Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome in a 16-year-old female patient. The diagnosis of the condition was made based on the patient history, clinical and radiographic examination, computed tomography (CT), and angiogram.
