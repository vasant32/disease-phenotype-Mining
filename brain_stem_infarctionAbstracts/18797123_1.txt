We report a unique male patient presenting with portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) due to intrahepatic portohepatic venous (PHV) shunts. He was diagnosed as having Klippel-Tr√©naunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) based on the findings of a hemitruncal port-wine stain with subcutaneous arteriovenous fistulae and varicose veins in the legs. However, limb-hypertrophy, which is one of the most cardinal manifestations of KTWS, was absent, and in KTWS, PSE is quite a rare clinical manifestation. Hence, the clinical picture of this patient was unusual. Our clinical observation suggests that KTWS can be one of the underlying disorders causing PSE.
