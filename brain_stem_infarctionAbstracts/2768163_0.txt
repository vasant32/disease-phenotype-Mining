Fifteen patients presenting with visual, oculomotor and behavioural disturbances were diagnosed to be suffering from "top of the basilar" syndrome. Computed tomography confirmed the distribution of infarctions in the vascular territory of the rostral basilar artery. The clinical profile comprised cortical blindness and visual field defects, vertical gaze paresis, memory and behavioural disturbances and in one patient, the paramedian diencephalic syndrome.
