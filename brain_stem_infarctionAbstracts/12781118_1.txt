INTRODUCTION: Gorham-Stout syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by osteolysis and microscopic proliferation of abnormal vessels. We report two cases of this syndrome associated with lymphatic and venous malformations. CASE REPORTS: The first case is a 5-year-old boy with disseminated lymphangiomatosis of poor prognosis, with significant pleural involvement and osteolytic lesions. The second case is a 5-year-old girl with a diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome with significant skeletal involvement of the lower extremities and secondary pathological fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Gorham-Stout syndrome may occasionally be associated with various lymphatic and venous malformations. Osteolysis and bone resorption may be induced by lymphatic bone involvement.
