This article discusses a Dutch questionnaire survey of 60 adult patients and 37 children with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KT), a triad of congenital anomalies characterized by a vascular nevus, varicose veins and bony and soft-tissue hypertrophy. This is the first study known that focuses on the psychological impact of KT. Slow deterioration was found in 40% of adult patients. About 70% report slightly moderate to serious limitations in their daily functioning. Problems in the doctor-patient relationship, as well as psychological problems related to KT, are described. Of the children with KT 75% of the parents report that the condition is stable; 58% of the parents do not report any daily limitations. It is concluded that patients in worse health are suffering from the negative impact and psychological influences of KT. At present an optimal, caring doctor-patient relationship is suggested as the best treatment in some cases for KT.
