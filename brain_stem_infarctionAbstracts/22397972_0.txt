 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The salt-and-pepper pain is a characteristic sensory disturbance confined to the eyes and regional facial structures. Although a poor prognosis has been mentioned in previously reported patients, the precise pathomechanism and clinical significance are still unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report four patients with ocular salt-and-pepper pain, and review the clinical course, neuroimaging and prognosis in another eight patients reported in the literature. RESULTS: In our series, they were three men and one woman, and their underlying cause was pontine hemorrhage; hypertensive hemorrhage in three and cavernous hemangioma in one patient, respectively. In these 12 salt-and-pepper patients, the identifiable etiology was exclusively brainstem stroke. Life-threatening or disable neurological deterioration ensued within 24 h after pain onset in all patients. Their ocular pain subsided rapidly after neurological deterioration occurred. A dual excitation of nociceptive quinothalamic pain fiber and disinhibition of trigeminosensory system from pontine reticular formation and cerulotrigeminospinal circuit may be responsible for this pain. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, ocular salt-and-pepper pain in quiet eyes should be alerted for intracranial pathology and neurological deterioration until underlying cause is identified.
