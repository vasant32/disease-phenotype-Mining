We report the case of a 20-year-old man with possible Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia) who developed an episode of massive haemoptysis from a bleeding pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in the left lower lobe of his lung. During the acute haemorrhage, he also appeared to suffer a coronary air embolism, possibly due to introduction of air into the bleeding arteriovenous malformation during intermittent positive pressure ventilation through the endotracheal tube. His electrocardiogram showed extensive ST elevation (>2 mm) in the inferolateral leads associated with raised troponin I and creatine kinase levels. These changes resolved within thirty minutes. The pulmonary arteriovenous malformation was successfully treated with a combination of alcohol injection and coil embolization.
