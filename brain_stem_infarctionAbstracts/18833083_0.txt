The case of a 14-year-old girl suffering from Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome associated with multiple port-wine stain type vascular anomalies and varicose veins involving upper limbs is described. Finger deformations are common in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. In our patient, striking hypertrophy of soft tissues and overgrowth of bones were observed on both forearms and finger deformations were observed particularly on right thumb and index finger. Although lower limb involvement is very common amongst the patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, in our patient involvement of the lower limbs was not observed.
