Transluminal angioplasty of brachiocephalic vessels for atherosclerotic lesions is now being performed in selected cases. We have thus far treated 17 cases of vertebral artery stenosis and one case of basilar artery stenosis by intravascular balloon dilatation techniques. Clinical presenting symptoms included vertebral basilar insufficiency, repeated transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and multiple strokes. We performed successful transluminal angioplasty in 16 patients with marked narrowing (greater than 70%) of the dominant vertebral artery from atherosclerosis. One patient with basilar artery stenosis with tandem atherosclerotic lesions was also treated by angioplasty techniques. Repeat angiography at 3- to 12-month intervals has revealed continued patency at the angioplasty site. Complications occurred in our one patient with basilar artery angioplasty, who suffered a brainstem infarction after treatment, and in one patient who had a TIA after bilateral vertebral artery angioplasty. Two other patients had residual vertebral stenosis but remained asymptomatic after the procedure. All other patients who had successful dilatation were asymptomatic at 6 months to 2 years (mean, 15 months) of follow-up. These initial studies indicate that vertebral artery angioplasty may be effective for treating high-grade atherosclerotic lesions and for improving blood flow to the posterior circulation. Angioplasty of the basilar artery is technically more difficult and has a higher degree of risk because of the many perforating branches supplying the brainstem.
