A three-year-old boy presented with status epilepticus with right hemiconvulsion and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) that were preceded by disturbance of consciousness and right hemiplegia just after a traumatic head injury. He was diagnosed as Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) because of the presence of a small cutaneous port-wine nevus and the nature of his MRI findings. The nevus was located in the middle of the forehead and was light in color. Intravenous drip infusion of lidocaine was effective for the treatment of CPSE, but the patient has experienced refractory complex partial seizures since then. It has not yet been reported that patients with SWS developed CPSE following head trauma, although it is known that patients with SWS can manifest convulsive status epilepticus. CPSE should be recognized as one of the seizure types of SWS.
