Patients with large venous malformations are at risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. Currently, there is no general consensus on the proper treatment for these patients. We present 3 preadolescent patients with large upper extremity venous malformations, who developed deep venous thrombosis; 2 had documented pulmonary emboli, one of which was fatal. It is imperative that patients and families be educated regarding the potential life-threatening sequelae that may be associated with these large vascular malformations.
