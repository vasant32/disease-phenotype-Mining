We reviewed the results of trabeculectomy performed in six patients (seven eyes) with glaucoma associated with the Sturge-Weber syndrome. After follow-up periods ranging from 9 months to 9 years, intraocular pressure control was adequate in two eyes without the use of antiglaucoma medication; control was good in four eyes with mild medication. One eye required three trabeculectomies and postoperative medication to achieve control. There was no further deterioration of visual acuity or of the optic nerve in any of the eyes.
