Twenty-eight patients with congenital total hypertrophy and ten patients with lower limb hypertrophy with congenital vascular abnormalities are reviewed. The pattern of increase in leg length discrepancy during growth and its influence on surgical management is discussed and the clinical features of the affected limbs are described. In congenital total hypertrophy the maximal increase in leg length discrepancy of more than 2.5 cm at age 4 years are likely to develop significant limb overgrowth that will require eventual surgical correction. In patients with congenital vascular abnormalities the change of leg length discrepancy was variable in degree and unpredictable in pattern, even in those with similar venous anomalies. The outcome for the limb was detergiography.
