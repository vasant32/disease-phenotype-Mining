Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a triad of cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, and localized hypertrophy of soft tissue and bone. Orthopedic surgical intervention may be required for the management of localized limb-length discrepancy or joint arthropathy, especially in the lower limb. We describe the management of a 33-year-old patient with a diagnosis of KTS and severe knee arthropathy. After treatment with a posterostabilized, cemented total knee arthroplasty, his range of motion was improved and at 5 years follow-up the clinical outcome was good. We are not aware of any previous reports on the prosthetic management of knee arthropathy in KTS. Precise preoperative diagnosis and analysis of the vascular abnormalities must be undertaken and the case discussed with vascular surgical colleagues as part of the preoperative planning process.
