PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) in characterizing diffuse choroidal hemangiomas in Sturge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: A retrospective case review of children attending a university hospital clinic with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome was undertaken. The FFA findings of seven patients who had undergone angiography were reviewed. RESULTS: FFA confirmed the presence of choroidal hemangioma in each of the seven cases and delineated the extent of the choroidal lesions. No adverse effects of fluorescein injection were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: FFA is effective in diagnosing and characterizing diffuse choroidal hemangiomas, and may be performed safely in children.
