We report a case of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome which was suggested by microcalcifications detected on routine mammograms. Based on mammographic findings subcutaneous localization was suspected and a skin with subcutaneous cellular tissue biopsy was performed, confirming the microcalcifications at this level. The anatomopathologic report consisted of increase in vascularization in the subcutaneous adipose tissue due to capillary and small-venule proliferation, with intramural calcium deposits.
