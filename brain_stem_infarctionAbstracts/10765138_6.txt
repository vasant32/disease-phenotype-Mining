A number of surgical procedures are available for patients with epilepsy associated with diffuse hemispheric disorders. In this report, 16 pediatric patients had hemispherectomy: 5 underwent hemidecortication and 11 had peri-insular hemispherotomy. The clinical records were retrospectively reviewed, and the results and complications of the procedures were documented. The procedure was feasible in very young children and in the absence of ventriculomegaly.
