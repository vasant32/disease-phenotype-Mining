We report four patients with Sturge Weber syndrome in which the pial angioma was visualized better with Gd-DOTA enhanced MR imaging. MR alone demonstrated thickened cortex with diminished convolutions, abnormal white matter and prominent subependymal veins. However, Gd-DOTA enhanced MR imaging improved the visualization of the angioma, localizing and demonstrating the extent of the malformation in Sturge Weber syndrome. We believe that this is the procedure of choice to recognize the extent of the intracranial involvement and which would help to select those patients that would benefit from surgical treatment.
