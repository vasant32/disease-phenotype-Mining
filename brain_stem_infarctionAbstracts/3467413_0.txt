As reported by Gorlin, Pindborg and Cohen, hemifacial hypertrophy is not an affection sui generis, but one that presents different aspects and is of varied etiology. The presence of a tumor must be excluded initially. The hemifacial lesion may be congenital, and form part of a diffuse affection involving the whole of one side of body including hard and soft tissues such as the tongue. Because of their role in cephalic organogenesis, an alteration in cells of neural crests appears to be at the origin of this form but the authors consider that the initial lesion develops at a much earlier stage. The lesion may be tissue-orientated: nervous as in the case of Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis; vascular as in diffuse angiodysplasias such as the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Here again the tongue participates in the expression of the disease. Finally, hemifacial hypertrophy may be secondary to a bone lesion as found in more or less diffuse fibrous osteopathies or possibly hypercondylar disorders, the absence of a tongue lesion being a diagnostic factor.
