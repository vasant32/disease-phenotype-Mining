Clinical presentation of a child with port-wine stain and seizures leads to the suspicion of Sturge-Weber disease (SWD). This diagnosis can be confirmed by the detection of a meningeal angiomatosis. In rare cases, early detection of meningeal pathology by ultrasound has been reported. Key findings are brain atrophy, gyriform cortical calcifications demonstrated by skull radiographs after the first year of life or earlier by cranial CT, and dys- or aplasia of the deep cerebral veins on angiography. Radionuclide imaging shows focal or diffuse tracer accumulation over the affected brain regions. MR demonstrates an abnormal appearance of the affected meninges, especially thickening and pathologically increased signal intensity after Gd-DTPA application. This, in association with the demonstration of abnormal enhancement in deep medullary veins, is the most characteristic finding. Contrast-enhanced MR allows early and non-invasive diagnosis of SWD, mainly by revealing leptomeningeal angiomatosis and abnormal venous vessels.
