Lymphatic malformations (LM) are the most frequent vascular malformations. There are three types of lesions involving lymphatic development that must be included in LM: vascular anomalies and knots (truncal malformations [TLM]); cystic anomalies, superficial or deep, uni- or multicystic (extratruncal malformations [ETLM]) and hemolymphatic anomalies which combine venous, arterial, or capillary malformations with LM. ETLM can be ubiquitously distributed but most are located in the cervical or axillary regions. Most ETLM are diagnosed at birth and in 80-90% of the cases before the age of 2. The clinical aspects are extremely variable: superficial ETLM (vesicular) and deep ETLM, localised or diffuse, mono- or multicystic. TLM are generally located on a lower limb with neonatal lymphatic oedema (often in a polymalformation context). All forms of the hemolymphatic combination can be identified. They are generally located on the limbs and are often unilateral. They are usually sporadic but can also be can be found in polymalformation syndromes (Klippel-Trénaunay, Parkes-Weber, Protée, Maffucci). ETLM generally tend to increase in volume and spread with age with stabilisation at puberty. They do not tend to spontaneously regress. Specific local complications can have serious consequences. They are linked to haemorrhaging, infections and compression phenomena. There can also be complications such as skeletal and soft tissue hypertrophy.
