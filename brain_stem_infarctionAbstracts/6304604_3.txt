Three young patients with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS), pelvic hemangiomatosis and bleeding are presented. Two children had rectal bleeding and the third presented with hematuria. Radiologic investigation of these patients with complicated angiodysplasia is reviewed. In infants and children calcified phleboliths seen on plain radiographs point toward the correct diagnosis. Angiography shows the vascular malformation which is usually on the venous side. Computed tomography delineates the angiomatous masses and identifies upward extension in the pelvis. Urography or renal ultrasound may show an associated kidney anomaly or tumor.
