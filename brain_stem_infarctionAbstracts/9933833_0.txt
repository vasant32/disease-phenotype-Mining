BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine whether there is a gender difference in the need for urodynamics in the evaluation of urinary incontinence after cerebrovascular accident (CVA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 72 consecutive post-CVA patients with new onset urinary incontinence documented by the patients or the persons who looked after them. Patients were evaluated between 4 and 6 weeks after their CVA and all had negative urine cultures and a postvoid residual urine determination. Exclusion criteria included narrow angle glaucoma, postvoid residual urine greater than 100 cm3 and radiographic evidence for a brainstem infarct. This left 30 male (mean age 65) and 30 female (mean age 67) patients evaluable. Patients were empirically started on anticholinergic medications and timed voids for 4 weeks after which cytoscopy and cystometry were performed. RESULTS: 28/30 females (93%) reported subjective improvement in their continence with conservative measures. 1 (3%) was found to have a urethral diverticulum, and 1 (3%) had uninhibited detrusor contractions that did not improve with medications. In the male group, 20/30 (67%) reported subjective improvement, 5 (17%) developed elevated postvoid residual urine volumes, 3 (10%) were diagnosed with urethral strictures, 1 (3%) had a bladder neck contracture, and 1 (3%) had transitional cell carcinoma in situ in the bladder. CONCLUSION: In the patient with new onset urinary incontinence in the initial period after CVA, an empiric trial of anticholinergic medications and timed voiding may be warranted in a select population of female patients without urodynamic testing or cystoscopy. This conservative approach may not be appropriate in males because of their increased likelihood of having secondary urologic conditions.
