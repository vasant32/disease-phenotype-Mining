In this study, we examined whether topologic network analysis, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can detect abnormalities of functional brain connectivity in children with unilateral brain injury due to Sturge-Weber syndrome. Three children with Sturge-Weber syndrome (ages 1, 3, and 10 years) underwent structural and resting state functional MRI, glucose metabolism positron emission tomography (PET), and neurocognitive evaluation. Eight different resting state networks were compared between the affected and unaffected hemispheres by quantitatively accessing communication efficiency measures. Significantly reduced efficiency values were found in all 3 patients. Visual network deficiency was present in both children with a visual field defect; frontal network abnormalities were associated with fine motor impairment. Location of network abnormalities corresponded to and, in some cases, extended beyond structural MRI and glucose PET abnormalities. The presented approach can detect early functional abnormalities of specific brain networks in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
