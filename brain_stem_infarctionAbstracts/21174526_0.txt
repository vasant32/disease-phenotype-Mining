 BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber disease) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by severe and recurrent nosebleeds, muco-cutaneous telangiectasias, and, in some cases, life-threatening visceral arteriovenous malformations. Ocular abnormalities include conjunctival telangiectasia, arteriovenous fistula, angiectasia, phlebectasia, and angioma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe the ocular abnormalities in 8 patients from a pedigree with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This article also reviews and discusses the relevant literature. RESULTS: Five patients (62.5%) had conjunctival telangiectasias and 3 (37.5%) retinal abnormalities, consisting mainly of choriocapillaris atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the occurrence of choriocapillaris atrophy in patients affected by hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and belonging to the same pedigree.
