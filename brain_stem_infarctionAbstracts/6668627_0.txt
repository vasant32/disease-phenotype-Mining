A 2 1/2 year old boy accidentally ingested the herbicide diquat. Progressive neurologic dysfunction preceded his death 143 hours after poisoning. Brain stem infarction and purpura were noted at post mortem and closely resembled the brain stem pathology in 3 of 7 adults who died after diquat ingestion. Renal, gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement in this child also resembled that seen in adults after ingestion of diquat. Hemoperfusion was performed six times in an effort to lower the body diquat burden. Cellulose-coated, activated charcoal was first employed 40 hours postingestion and removed diquat from serum with clearances of 104 and 39 ml/minute at the initiation of hemoperfusion and 6 hours later, respectively. Serum diquat concentrations decreased rapidly during charcoal hemoperfusion. However, marked rebound in serum diquat concentrations were noted between charcoal treatments, indicating extensive sequestration of diquat by tissues. Thrombocytopenia and hypocalcemia, the major complications of charcoal hemoperfusion, were easily treated. Unlike charcoal, Amberlite XAD-4 resin hemoperfusion did not remove diquat from serum. Charcoal hemoperfusion may temporarily reduce serum diquat concentrations. Whether the early institution and daily performance of charcoal hemoperfusion will minimize diquat-induced damage to brain and other organs is not clear from this case and will only be determined in future studies.
