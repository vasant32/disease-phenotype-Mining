We report our experience with Molteno implants in 27 eyes of 20 children with glaucoma. Associated ocular findings included Sturge Weber syndrome (one patient), aniridia and retinoschisis (one patient), aphakia (seven patients, eight eyes), rubella syndrome (two patients), Peters anomaly (one patient), and Treacher Collins syndrome (one patient). Fifteen eyes received a single-plate implant, and 12 eyes received a double-plate implant in two stages. The patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 13 years (mean 47 +/- 55 months). The average number of previous glaucoma procedures was four per eye (range two to 10). The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 36 months (mean 20 +/- 9 months). The mean intraocular pressure before surgery was 34 +/- 4 mm Hg. The mean postoperative intraocular pressure was 19 +/- 11 mm Hg at 1 month and 19 +/- 6 mm Hg at 1 year (p < 0.001 at both times). After surgery nine eyes (33.3%) required no medication for control of intraocular pressure. Additional surgery was required in 12 eyes (44.4%). We believe the Molteno implant is a useful approach for children with glaucoma who fail to respond to standard medical and surgical treatments.
