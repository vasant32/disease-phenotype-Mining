An intraosseous hemangioma of the lunate was diagnosed as the cause of wrist complaints. At angiography considerable arteriovenous shunting within the bone was shown. Replacement of the lunate by a SILASTIC implant relieved the pain. The intraosseous hemangioma, however, appeared to be only a part of more wide-spread disease which fulfilled the criteria for a Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome.
