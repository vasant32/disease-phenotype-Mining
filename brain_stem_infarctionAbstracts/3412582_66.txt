Among 47 patients with stroke evaluated clinically and videofluoroscopically, one-half aspirated. Patients with combined cerebral-brainstem strokes with bilateral cranial nerve signs were at greatest risk, but aspiration also occurred in the context of unilateral signs. Dysphonia was the common clinical characteristic of aspirating patients. Single chest roentgenograms were of limited value in predicting aspiration. Outcome was favorable following compensatory oral feeding programs.
