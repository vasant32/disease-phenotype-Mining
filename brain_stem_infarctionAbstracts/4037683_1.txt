Four patients with pyogenic hepatic abscesses are reported. There were three females and one male with an age range of 36-75 years. In all the cases, diabetes mellitus was associated. Confirmation of the abscesses was obtained by liver scanning or ultrasonography, or both. In one patient, the clinical course was complicated by sympathetic pericardial effusion with right heart failure. Two patients had percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the abscesses under fluoroscopy. All four patients eventually required laparotomy and open drainage of the abscesses. Diabetic control was achieved with insulin therapy. The common causative organism in all instances was the Klebsiella species. Three patients recovered. The remaining one developed hypotension post-operatively and died of brain-stem infarction and the hepato-renal syndrome.
