Five children (3 girls, 2 boys, aged from 1 to 18 years) presenting with Sturge-Weber syndrome were explored by MRI with contrast injection in 2 cases. The respective positions of CT and MRI are discussed: CT is the method of choice to display leptomeningeal calcifications. MRI seems to be more accurate than CT to determine the location of the lesions and to demonstrate the enhancement of the angioma after contrast injection.
