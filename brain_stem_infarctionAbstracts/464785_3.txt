In protracted forms of dysphagia associated with neuromuscular dysfunction, myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter has been suggested. The literature, however, is unclear about the indications and outcome of this procedure. In this article, 3 cases are presented of dysphagia associated with the failure of relaxation of the cricopharyngeus during swallowing. Two patients had brain stem infarctions and the 3rd had an inflammatory disease of the brain stem. In all patients, barium swallow revealed aspiration of contrast material into the trachea with failure of relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter. Indirect laryngoscopy demonstrated partial paralysis of one or both vocal cords. In one, an emg of the laryngeal muscles showed normal results. A complete evaluation by the speech pathologist failed to reveal abnormality of the oral musculature in all patients. All patients required gastrostomies for their nutritional needs. Therapeutic modification and control of rate, quantity and consistency of food along with counseling for prevention of aspiration. Oral feeding, without aspiration, was achieved in the 3 patients within the treatment period, allowing removal of the gastrostomy. Cricopharyngeal myotomy, therefore, was not necessary in these patients, despite the long duration of the swallowing problem.
