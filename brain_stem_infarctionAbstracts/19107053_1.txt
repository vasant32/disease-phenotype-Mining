PURPOSE: To report a case of uveal effusion with subtotal exudative retinal detachment induced by topical administration of travoprost. CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old woman with a medical history of right-sided Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome and bilateral aphakia secondary to congenital cataract extraction was referred to our department for retinal detachment associated with uveal effusion of the right eye. The ocular manifestations of Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome in her right eye were glaucoma and diffuse choroidal hemangioma. Antiglaucomatous medications using topical travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% (fixed combination) had been begun 1 week before. An adverse effect of travoprost was suspected and the drug was discontinued. Three weeks later, a fundus examination showed total disappearance of the uveal effusion. CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of the effects of topical prostaglandin analogs (blood-aqueous barrier disruption, enhancement of uveoscleral outflow) with both the diffuse choroidal hemangioma and the elevated episcleral venous pressure may lead to uveal effusion in Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome. In spite of their efficiency, prostaglandin F2 analogs (latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost) should be used with caution in Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome and particularly in cases of proved diffuse choroidal hemangioma.
