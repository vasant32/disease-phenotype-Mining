PURPOSE:To report indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) findings in one patient of diffuse choroidal hemangioma associated with Struge-Weber syndrome. METHODS: Color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA) and ICGA were performed in a patient with diffuse choroidal hemangioma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. RESULTS: Three findings were unveiled by ICGA: rapid filling of diffuse choroidal hemangio's vascular network in the early stages; diffuse hyperfluorescence visual up to the late phase; no "wash-out" phenomenon was observed in the late phase. CONCLUSION: Indocyanine green angiography can provide information that is not detected by clinical or fluorescence angiographic examination in the patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome. ICGA may be important and sensitive in detecting the diffuse choroidal hamangioma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
