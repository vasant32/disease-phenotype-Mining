Limb or digital overgrowth occurs in a number of rare conditions. Hypertrophy is present at birth in cases of macrodactyly simplex congenita, macromelia, hemihypertrophy, and the Klippel- Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Late-onset overgrowth is a feature of macrodystrophia lipomatosa and neurofibromatosis. We have reviewed more than 40 patients with overgrowth disorders in order to clarify problems of differentiation and classification, and in this article we have depicted and discussed typical cases. The course, prognosis and complications differ in these autonomous conditions; for this reason accurate diagnosis is vital.
