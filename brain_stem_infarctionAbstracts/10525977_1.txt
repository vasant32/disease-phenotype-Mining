We describe two patients with upper medullary infarctions showing ipsilateral facial weakness and relative sparing of the upper facial muscles. Electrophysiological follow-up using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in combination with stimulation of the peripheral facial nerve disclosed a supranuclear (corticofacial) tract lesion in one patient and a partial nuclear/infranuclear intra-axial facial nerve lesion in another.
