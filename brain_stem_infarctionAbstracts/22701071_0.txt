This is a case of a 22-year-old male who was born with a port-wine stain on right side of his face, developed seizures at the age of 2, was not able to complete formal education in a school. MRI revealed intracranial calcification and left-sided brain atrophy. He had diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Since the time of adolescence, he developed psychiatric problems and hence was treated with psychotropic medications. This case remains under the domain of psychiatry as well as neurology and calls for joint management. A number of presentations with Sturge-Weber syndrome have been reported in the literature that poses problems in terms of appropriate medical management. A classical syndrome like this invites serious attention of both psychiatrists and neurologists to devise appropriate drug treatment with a view of interactions, side effects, complications and prognosis.
