Sturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by a facial vascular nevus associated with an ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma. Variants of this classical presentation have been described in the literature, some of which have prognostic significance. We report a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed variant of a leptomeningeal angioma contralateral to the facial nevus. We describe one patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome who presented with a left-sided facial nevus, left eye glaucoma, episodes of left-sided weakness, and right-sided leptomeningeal angiomatosis by gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI. The literature regarding variants of Sturge-Weber syndrome and their prognosis is reviewed. The prognosis for this variant is likely similar to Sturge-Weber syndrome with an ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma.
