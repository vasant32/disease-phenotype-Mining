PURPOSE: To report successful treatment of a diffuse choroidal hemangioma associated with chronic retinal detachment. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A patient with bilateral Sturge Weber syndrome and associated retinal detachments failed external beam radiation. He was then treated with single session, multispot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. There was prompt resolution of the retinal detachment and significant reduction in thickness of the choroidal hemangioma. CONCLUSION: Verteporfin therapy may be useful in diffuse choroidal hemangiomas.
