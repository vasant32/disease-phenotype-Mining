We present our experience of two cases with genitourinary manifestations of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. A MEDLINE search for the period 2001-2004 was done using the keywords "Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome", "vascular malformation" and "genitourinary". Only three cases with genitourinary manifestations of this syndrome were reported during this period. Genitourinary problems are rare in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome; however, their management may be a challenge for the urologist. In one of our patients who failed to respond to endoscopic laser coagulation and partial cystectomy we used systemic alpha-interferon, with a good short-term response.
