BACKGROUND: Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis) is a rather uncommon congenital condition that is characterized by a combination of venous angioma of leptomeninges over the cerebral cortex and ipsilateral angiomatous lesions of the face and sometimes of the skull, jaws, and oral soft tissues. It is commonly referred to as Sturge-Weber syndrome after Sturge and Weber who first described this affliction in 1879. This article presents a case of Sturge-Weber syndrome associated with severe gingival enlargement, its management, and follow-up results. METHODS: A 15-year-old male patient was referred to the Department of Periodontics, Government Dental College and Hospital, for severe gingival enlargement. A detailed dental and medical history, clinical examination, and investigations confirmed the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. This report reveals a classic presentation of the syndrome with emphasis on its oral manifestations. Periodontal management included thorough scaling and root planing followed by periodontal flap surgery to treat the gingival enlargement. Histopathologic examination of the excisional biopsy specimen revealed features suggestive of fibrous gingival enlargement. RESULTS: Reevaluation of the patient after 2 years showed remarkable (90%) reduction of the gingival enlargement in the maxillary arch and complete diminution (100%) in the mandibular arch. However, a slight recurrence was noted in the maxillary right quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: Sturge-Weber syndrome is clinically important to the periodontist because of its associated gingival vascular features and their complicating manifestations. Periodic systemic and oral examinations are recommended to identify and prevent any complications from the cranial and oral lesions.
