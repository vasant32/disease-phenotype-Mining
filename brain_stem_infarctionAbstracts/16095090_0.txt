Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a rare genetically determined disorder that affects blood vessels throughout the body and results in a tendency for bleeding. Authors describe the case of superselective embolization of the left maxillary artery with polyvinyl alcohol particles in a patient with the Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome hospitalized and treated in the Department of Otolaryngology and the Department of Radiology of the Military Institute in Warszawa, Poland due to persistent, severe and difficult to manage nasal bleeding. After the procedure had been performed patient condition improved and frequency and severity of nasal bleeding significantly diminished. Authors conclude that superselective embolization of the maxillary artery in a patient with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is safe and effective and can be a valuable alternative to the maxillary artery or the carotis externa artery ligation. Authors also describe other methods of nasal bleeding management: laser photocoagulation, argon plasma coagulation, nasal dermoplasty and pharmacological treatment. Authors indicate that treating patients with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for a physician and surgeon that require special approach to a patient due to difficult to manage symptoms. Patients with Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome should be treated in a hospital setting due to access to diagnostic imaging techniques that can be helpful in revealing possible life threatening conditions.
