PURPOSE: To describe the gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound imaging features of vascular canals in human femoral condylar epiphysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vascular canals in the femoral condylar epiphysis were examined using gray-scale and Doppler US. The study was performed in 45 volunteers (aged <1 month-72 years) who comprised 1 subject with short stature, 1 subject with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and 43 subjects with normal growth. RESULTS: In the 8-year-old and younger group (n=34), vascular canals were observed in 32 subjects (94%), whereas vascular canals were not observed in the 9-year-old and older group (n=11). Vascular canals were visualized as hyperechoic lines and dots. With Doppler US, blood flow in the vascular canals was observed in 20 of the 32 subjects (62.5%). Spectral Doppler analysis was possible in 15 subjects, in all of whom only arterial waveforms were observed. CONCLUSION: US was helpful to delineate the vascular canals and flow therein. The detection and evaluation of vascular canals and blood flow therein may prove useful in understanding growth.
