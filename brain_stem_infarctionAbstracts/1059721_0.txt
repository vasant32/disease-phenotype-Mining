Chronic liver disease typical of chronic active 'lupoid' hepatitis together with cyanosis, clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in a 42-year-old female is described. In addition she had severe nose bleeds, gastro-intestinal haemorrhages, syncopal attacks with generalised convulsive seizures, pulmonary arterio-venous fistulae as manifestations of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome. A study of the literature revealed that similar associations are far more frequent than can be attribtued to chance. Possible mechanisms of the cyanosis, clubbing and osteoarthropathy and possible common pathogenesis for these seemingly unrelated disorders are discussed.
