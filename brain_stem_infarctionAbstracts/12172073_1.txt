We report a patient with medial medullary infarction who could be diagnosed in an early stage, and we discuss the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for stroke rehabilitation. In the case of our patient, the infarction was difficult to diagnose because the patient had atypical features and a past history of head injury. Nonetheless, we could diagnose the medial medullary infarction easily using diffusion MRI within several hours of onset. Then, a rehabilitation program was started the day after onset. We believe that diffusion MRI can be used as a useful method for very early stage diagnosis and to execute rehabilitation for early stroke patients.
