Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) is a sensitive and specific technique for imaging acute hemispheric infarction. Its utility in the diagnosis of acute brainstem infarction has not been well studied. We present 3 cases of brainstem infarction in which DW MRI performed 5 to 15 hours after symptom onset failed to reveal any abnormality. Repeat diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 2 to 5 days later did demonstrate an abnormality in the clinically appropriate region in each instance. This suggests that the time course to the development of abnormalities detectable by DWI may be longer in brainstem than in hemispheric infarctions. Therefore, repeat studies after initially negative DWI might be useful in the diagnosis of brainstem infarctions.
