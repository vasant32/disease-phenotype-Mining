Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) in prothrombotic patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) is not considered a setting for elective PFO closure. We describe a 35-year-old woman with known PFO, recurrent PE on warfarin, and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome-a condition with predisposition for thromboembolism-who suffered concurrent saddle PE and devastating stroke with further impending paradoxical embolus across the PFO. Optimal management in patients with biatrial thromboembolus caught in transit across PFO is challenging. Patients with recurrent PE, prothrombotic states, and PFO should be considered for PFO closure. Prompt diagnosis of impending paradoxical embolus with echocardiography and consideration of surgical removal and PFO closure are critical.
