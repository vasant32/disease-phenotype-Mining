A patient developed frontal-lobe syndrome and psychotic symptoms after infarction in the pontomesencephalic junction. Stereotaxic lesion localization on magnetic resonance imaging and statistical analyses of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) disclosed an involvement of the rostral brainstem dopaminergic nuclei and hypoperfusion in the frontal-subcortical circuit components. We suggest that the patient's cognitive and behavioral disturbances were associated with disruption of ascending dopaminergic projections to the frontal-subcortical circuits.
