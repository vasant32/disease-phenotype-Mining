The case of a 12-year-old girl with Klippel-Tr√©naunay syndrome and the signs of median nerve entrapment is reported. A cavernous haemangioma surrounding the median nerve is thought to be responsible for the carpal tunnel syndrome through mechanical compression and ischemic damage to the nerve due to the changed haemodynamic situation in the carpus.
