Management of glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is difficult. The authors reviewed 36 eyes of 30 SWS patients with either early or late-onset glaucoma with a mean follow-up of 122 months (range, 24-253 months). Intervals between required surgical or medical interventions were analyzed. Intervention was attributed to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in 55% of cases and disc change in 45%. Median stable postoperative interval with goniotomy was 12 months; with trabeculotomy, 21 months; with trabeculectomy, 34 months; with argon laser trabeculoplasty, 25 months; and with medications, 57 months. Survival analysis shows statistically significant differences between goniotomy and medications. Intraoperative choroidal expansions developed in 24% of cases receiving a trabeculectomy, and none developed with either goniotomy or trabeculotomy.
