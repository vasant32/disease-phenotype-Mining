A case of cerebral AVM associated with Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is presented where Magnetic Resonance (MRI) flow measurement revealed details of the shunt from the cerebral arterial system. The AVM was supplied by two arteries, the main flow came from the left vertebral and internal carotid artery. The arterial blood supply of the AVM was about 268 ml/min, the av-shunt flow was about 18% of the whole carotid and vertebral upstream flow.
