The pathological changes in the syndrome of celiac disease, folate deficiency, bilateral occipital calcifications, and intractable epilepsy have not been previously described. A child with this disorder had a field defect correlating with active lateralized epileptic discharges and asymmetrical lesions. After resection of the right occipital lobe she was seizure free for 4 years. A cortical vascular abnormality with patchy pial angiomatosis, fibrosed veins, and large jagged microcalcifications was found. These pathological abnormalities were similar though not identical to those found in the Sturge-Weber syndrome.
