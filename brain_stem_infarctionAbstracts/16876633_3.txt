BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is a rare mesodermal phakomatosis characterized by cutaneous hemangiomata, venous varicosities, and osseous-soft tissue hypertrophy of the affected limb. As the pathologic aspect of KTWS arises from the site in which malformations occur, the clinical picture varies widely from patients who complain for cosmetic reasons to patients with life-threatening lesions. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a very rare case in which KTWS was associated with a cervical intramedullary cavernous angioma surgically treated. CONCLUSION: This report confirms the wide range of expression of vascular abnormalities in neurocutaneous developmental diseases and the need of a careful multisystemic evaluation of these patients.
