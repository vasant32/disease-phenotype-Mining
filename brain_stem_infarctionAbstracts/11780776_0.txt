Most neurosurgeons consider temporary vessel occlusion for aneurysmal clipping an effective technique that facilitates dissection between the aneurysm and the parent vessel. It is generally believed that repeated short periods of cerebral ischemia are safer for the brain than a single long episode. The aim of this study was to identify whether interrupted and uninterrupted vessel occlusion differs with regard to changes in brain tissue and cerebral hemodynamics after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Fifty Spraque Dawley rats (300-350 g) were placed under general anaesthesia and ventilated. The basilar artery was exposed through a transclival approach. Baseline local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) values was measured, and then the basilar artery was punctured, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Group I (n = 24) was subjected to 60 min of interrupted basilar artery occlusion, defined as 5 min of reperfusion after every 10 min of occlusion, group II (n = 26) 60 min of uninterrupted artery occlusion. Three days after completion of the experiment, each rat was neurologically evaluated and decapitated. Coronal brain slices were obtained and stained to assess infarct volume. Immediately after SAH, LCBF fell by 58% in group I, and by 52% in group II. In group I, each ischemic insult brought a similar reduction in LCBF, and after each release of the occlusion there was a rapid rise in flow. In group II, the LCBF values dropped initially and remained at low levels until the end of the study. The 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride stained sections showed similar volumes of brainstem infarction in both groups (38.3 +/- 9.2 mm3 vs. 34.3 +/- 8.7 mm3, respectively; p > 0.05). The results suggest that there is no neuroprotective advantage to either interrupted or uninterrupted temporary blockage of blood flow during neurovascular procedures after SAH in the basilar artery region.
