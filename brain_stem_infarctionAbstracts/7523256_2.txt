The case of a 20-year-old woman with a left-sided facial hemangioma and a homolateral glaucoma is reported, complete with the histology of a trabeculectomy specimen. Her left eye had an episcleral hemangioma and goniodysgenetic features in the anterior chamber angle, while the intraocular pressure was measured to be 45 mmHg. The left optic disc showed a large cupping and the left visual field was constricted. The right eye had no glaucomatous changes. Histological examination of the trabeculectomy specimen by both light and electron microscopy showed multiple congenital anomalies. There was a cluster of blood vessels in the trabecular meshwork. Abnormal accumulations of fine granular extracellular matrixes were observed in both the juxtacanalicular connective tissue and around the vascular structures. The lumen of Schlemm's canal was subdivided into three or four parts with few giant vacuole structures. The endothelial cells lining the inner wall of Schlemm's canal contained a well-formed basal lamina with many villi projecting into the lumen. These findings suggest that the multiple anomalies observed in the trabecular tissue may contribute to the manifestation of glaucoma in Sturge-Weber syndrome.
