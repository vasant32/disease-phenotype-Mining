We report cerebral cystic meningioangiomatosis in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2. An 18-year-old woman presented with progressive hemiparesis secondary to a meningioma at the foramen magnum. Her MR examination also demonstrated three small cortical and subcortical cystic lesions. She underwent surgery for the meningioma, but died from brainstem infarction. Post-mortem histopathological examination of the cystic lesions showed enlarged subcortical perivascular spaces with overlying meningioangiomatosis. The unusual features and possible pathogenesis are discussed.
