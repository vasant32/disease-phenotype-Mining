Central neurogenic hyperventilation in patients with a normal level of consciousness is uncommon. This condition occurs in bilateral pontine tegmental lesions, particularly tumors such as CNS lymphomas and glioma, as well as traumatic lesions. The physiopathological mechanisms are unknown and no there is no effective treatment for this entity. We report a case of central neurogenic hyperventilation associated to a unilateral basal pontine infarction.
