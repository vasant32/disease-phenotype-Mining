 UNLABELLED: Chronic, Infantile, Neurological, Cutaneous and Articular Syndrome (CINCA) or Neonatal/Infantile Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID/IOMID) is a rare, multisystem inflammatory disease characterised by neonatal onset of urticarial symptoms, persistent rash, ocular inflammatory lesions, progressive articular and neurological involvement and associated with characteristic overgrowth of the ossification nucleus of the patella. The tissues involved are extensively infiltrated by inflammatory cells, mostly neutrophils. This paper describes the clinical features of three new cases as well as a study of activation markers in neutrophils and search for mutations of the CIAS1gene in these patients. Clinical records of three cases of CINCA are reported. For genetic analysis, exon 3 of the CIAS1gene was amplified and sequenced. Immunophenotype, oxidative burst and phagocytosis were analysed in neutrophils obtained from all the three CINCA patients as well as from eight juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and eight healthy controls. Functional assays in neutrophils were normal in all three patients with CINCA syndrome and did not differ from those of JIA patients and healthy controls. The surface density of CD10 was significantly higher on neutrophils from CINCA patients as compared to those of JIA and controls (P<0.0005). In one subject a new missense mutation in the CIAS1gene was identified. CONCLUSION: the hyper expression of the activation antigen CD10/NEP in neutrophils from these three cases of CINCA, as compared to JIA patients and healthy controls, irrespective of the presence of mutations in CIAS1, could be a marker of the inflammatory disorder typical of some patients with CINCA syndrome.
