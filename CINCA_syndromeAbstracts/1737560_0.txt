A 35-year-old woman had since early childhood suffered from recurrent urticaria-like rash, intermittent fever, arthralgia and pancochlear inner-ear deafness. At the age of 17 years she also developed a steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, found to be due to renal amyloidosis (type AA). The triad of renal amyloidosis, inner-ear deafness and recurrent urticaria is characteristic of Muckle-Wells syndrome, which has a hereditary basis. Rapidly progressive renal failure necessitated long-term haemodialysis and two renal transplantations. The accompanying immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids, azathioprin and, later, cyclophosphamide brought about a remission of the joint and skin abnormalities. After removal of the first donor kidney and termination of immunosuppressive treatment the syndrome recurred with subacute growth of an amyloid goitre as well as amyloidosis of the optic nerve. A few weeks before death a malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the stomach was demonstrated. It was presumably a complication of long-term immunosuppression and not of the Muckle-Wells syndrome. The patient died of the complications of combination chemotherapy. Necropsy revealed generalized amyloidosis.
