Diagnosis of inflammatory non-infectious diseases with a neonatal onset is often retrospective. It may lead to aggressive and iatrogenic procedures. PATIENT: A 6-year-old boy was suffering, since birth, from recurrent febrile attacks including rashes, gastrointestinal manifestations and inflammatory joint involvement. This syndrome, partially improved with steroids, could have been of antenatal onset. Since the age of 4 years, the patient is considered as having hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS). DISCUSSION: HIDS must be distinguished from familial Mediterranean fever. Patients suffer from recurrent fever concomitant to inflammatory joint involvement, abdominal distress, skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly (especially seen in children). All patients have high serum IgD (> 100 UI/mL) and IgA levels. Nevertheless, a high IgD level is not specific. Our case could also be part of the CINCA (chronic, infantile, neurological, cutaneous and articular) syndrome, which includes similar early manifestations associated with a constant neurological and frequent ophthalmological involvement and epiphyseal changes; to date, these last three manifestations are not present in our patient. CONCLUSION: HIDS and CINCA syndrome are not known to be modified by any effective therapeutic agent. When presenting at birth, these inflammatory diseases must be considered as entities with a rarely described potential severity.
