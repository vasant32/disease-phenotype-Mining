BACKGROUND: Familial cold urticaria is a rare cutaneous and systemic reaction to cold with autosomal dominant inheritance, distinctive clinical features, and unknown pathogenesis. Release of a chymotrypsinlike substance has been postulated. To date, no effective treatment has been reported. OBSERVATIONS: Eight cases from a large family pedigree are described. Three members showed a very favorable response in their cold urticaria, when treated with stanozolol; the response was reproducible. Histologic examination of an early lesion in one case revealed evidence of mast cell degranulation. CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical observations are probably secondary epiphenomena. Correction of a deficiency of an inhibitory protein is a possible mechanism of action of stanozolol as in hereditary angioedema.
