An erythematous, burning papular eruption, constitutional symptoms, fever, and arthropathy developed in a 65-year-old patient after cold exposure. Involvement of other family members occurred in an autosomal dominant pattern. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen revealed telangiectasia and primarily neutrophilic perivascular inflammation, consistent with earlier biopsy reports of this syndrome. Although previously called "familial cold urticaria," this disease is not characterized by urticaria and may be best descriptively termed, "familial polymorphous cold eruption."
