Muckle-Wells syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by chronic recurrent urticaria, periodic arthritis, sensorineural deafness, general signs of inflammation, and secondary amyloidosis (AA type). We report on a 4-generation family with 7 persons sharing various signs of this syndrome associated with bipolar aphthosis in 5 cases and cystinuria in one. Two other relatives in the family had ichthyosis.
