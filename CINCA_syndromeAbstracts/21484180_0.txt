An 8-year-old patient with genetically confirmed chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome was treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra. She initially presented with recurrent episodes of fever, rash, chronic fatigue, frequent headaches, ocular involvement (corneal infiltrate and papillary edema), and permanent increased biologic inflammatory markers. Following treatment with anakinra, all symptoms and inflammation resolved. Ophthalmologic signs normalized. This ophthalmologic description (optic nerve and cornea) has never been illustrated, even if ocular affections are classic in the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes.
