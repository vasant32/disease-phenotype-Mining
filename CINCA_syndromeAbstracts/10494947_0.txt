PURPOSE: To inform ophthalmologists about neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), a rare condition with ophthalmologic manifestations. METHODS: We report a single case of NOMID with optic disc edema. RESULTS: A 28-month-old child with neonatal rash, arthropathy, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and optic disc edema was diagnosed with NOMID. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of posterior uveitis or optic disc edema in a child with juvenile onset arthritis may allow the differentiation of NOMID from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
