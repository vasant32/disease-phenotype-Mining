Fish and sediments from four places along the Spanish River Cinca were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). The samples were collected up- and downstream from Monz√≥n, a heavily industrialized town draining to the river. PBDEs and HBCD were found in sediments at levels ranging from 2 to 42 ng/g dry weight and from not detected (nd) to 514 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Twenty-three fish samples (Barbus graellsi) collected at the same places were also analyzed, showing levels from nd to 446 ng/g wet weight for PBDEs and from nd to 1172 ng/g wet weight for HBCD. The lowest values for both sediment and fish samples were found upstream of the industry. Of 40 congeners (from mono- to deca-BDEs) included in the analytical work, 8 PBDE congeners were detected in river sediments, whereas 17 different PBDEs were found in fish samples. Large fish-to-sediment ratios for these brominated compounds indicate that they are highly bioavailable, with the exception of deca-BDE which was only detected in sediment samples. Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCD were slightly higher in muscle tissues than in liver samples obtained from the same specimen of fish. Moreover, PBDE and HBCD concentrations are correlated with fish length indicating the bioaccumulation of these contaminants.
