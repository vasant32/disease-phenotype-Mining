 OBJECTIVES: Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) are rare periodic fevers associated with CIAS1 mutations. A third entity, the chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome was also recently associated with mutation in the same gene. A phenotypic and genotypic continuum seems to exist from the most benign (FCAS) to the most severe forms (CINCA). Although a CIAS1 mutation can be associated with two different phenotypes. METHODS: We report a family of three patients exhibiting the MWS and FCAS phenotypes. These phenotypes were associated with a novel missense mutation in CIAS1. RESULTS: Anakinra controlled inflammatory flares in the three patients. CONCLUSIONS: FCAS, MWS and CINCA could be different phenotype expressions of the same disease.
