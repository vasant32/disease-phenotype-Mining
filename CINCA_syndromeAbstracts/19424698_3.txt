Right chorioretinitis and bilateral pseudopapilledema were firstly appreciated in a 9-month-old child with neonatal findings of aseptic chronic meningitis, framed in the context of CINCA syndrome at 1 year. Therapeutical response to various combinations of drugs was inconsistent until 7 years, when anakinra was started with immediate clinical and laboratory improvement. A state of severe retinal dystrophy of post-inflammatory origin became evident on funduscopy, optical coherence tomography and visual electrophysiology tests at the age of 10 years, which remained stationary after 1 year of anakinra treatment.
