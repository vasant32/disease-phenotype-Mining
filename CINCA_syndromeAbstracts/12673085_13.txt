The Muckle-Wells syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder belonging to the group of hereditary fever syndromes. The chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology with neonatal onset. They are considered as two different entities. We report the case of a 36-year-old man suffering since birth from a nonpruritic generalized urticaria, with inflammatory flares, joint manifestations and progressive deafness requiring a bilateral hearing aid. An initial diagnosis of Muckle-Wells syndrome was made. However, the patient had an unusual clinical presentation with slightly dysmorphic facial appearance, clubbing of the fingers, mild mental retardation and papilledema. After a genetic advice, a diagnosis of CINCA syndrome was made. Search for mutations in the CIAS1 gene revealed a new mutation in a heterozygous state. This case report really raises the question of a link between these two inflammatory diseases. Further studies are needed to confirm the involvement of mutations of the CIAS1 gene in CINCA syndrome.
