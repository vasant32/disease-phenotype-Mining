Thirty-two bleak fish (Alburnus alburnus) from three places along the Spanish River Cinca, a tributary of Ebro River, were collected for polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) determinations. Sampling sites corresponded to up- and downstream from Monzon, a heavily industrialized town draining to the river. Four different PBDE congeners (BDE-47, -153, -154 and -183) and HBCD were found at levels ranging from not detected (nd) to 573 ng/g wet weight for total PBDEs and from nd to 1643 ng/g wet weight for HBCD. The lowest values were found upstream of the industrialized area. Concentrations in fish were compared with previous data in sediment samples collected at the same sampling sites, and large fish to sediment ratios for these brominated compounds indicate that they are highly bioavailable. Moreover, PBDE and HBCD concentrations are correlated with fish length and weight indicating the bioaccumulation of these contaminants.
