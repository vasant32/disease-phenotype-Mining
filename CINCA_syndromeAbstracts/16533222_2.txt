Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a rare syndrome, characterized by chronic recurrent urticaria, often combined with fever, chills, rigors, malaise, and arthralgia. Progressive sensorineural deafness, and, in approximately one third of the patients, amyloidosis of the kidneys as well as of other organs may occur. It was first described in 1962 by Muckle and Wells. Herein we describe six cases of MWS showing, in addition to the classic features of MWS, unique skin lesions that to the best of our knowledge have not been described before in association with MWS.
