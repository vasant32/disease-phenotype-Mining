A case of hereditary AA amyloidosis with Muckle-Wells syndrome is described. After a successful kidney transplantation for chronic renal failure due to renal amyloid deposits at age 21, the patient, a white female now 26 years of age, developed a large amyloid goiter as a manifestation of the systemic amyloidosis and recurrent monarthritides. Both observations are novel for this disease. Subtotal thyroidectomy and oral colchicine administration, known to be effective in preventing complications of familial Mediterranean fever, another hereditary type of AA amyloidosis, proved highly effective in the management of this unusual case.
