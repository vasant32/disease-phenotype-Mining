The protein NLRP3 has emerged as a central regulator in the inflammatory process, being implicated directly in hereditary cryopyrinopathies, and indirectly in diseases such as gout, Type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. NLRP3 is an important regulator of caspase-1, the enzyme that processes the immature form of IL-1Î² into the active protein. The control of NLRP3 has therefore become a focus of research with evidence for redox regulation, ubiquitination and regulation by miRNA-223, kinases and calcium all emerging as controllers of NLRP3. As our knowledge expands the prospect for precise pharmacological targeting of NLRP3 will improve and could lead to substantial clinical utility.
