In auto-inflammatory diseases, the role of the inflammasome and the interleukine IL-1beta has recently been shown. Thus, the physiopathology of rare diseases as Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is better understood. In the era of biologics, new treatments targeting IL-1 have been developped. Canakinumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting specifically IL-1beta Clinical studies have shown its efficacy on clinical symptoms and on inflammatory markers in patients with rare diseases such as CAPS or idiopathic juvenile arthritis, but also in more common rheumatic conditions like gout. Canakinumab has been approved in Switzerland only for the treatment of CAPS. Studies evaluating its effect on cardiovascular diseases are ongoing.
