 OBJECTIVE: Auto-inflammatory diseases (AIDs) are characterized by recurrent self-limiting systemic inflammation. In a multicentre effort, we set out to register genetic, epidemiological and clinical features as well as prognostic factors of these diseases by prospective longitudinal and long-term documentation, in order to define novel AIDs and to better understand treatment responses and outcome. METHODS: In 2009, a federally funded clinical and research consortium (AID-Net) was established, including an online registry for AIDs (http://www.aid-register.uk-essen.de). Inclusion criteria are disease-associated mutations for hereditary periodic fever syndromes [FMF, hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), TNF receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS)], or, alternatively, clinically confirmed AID, systemic-onset JIA (SoJIA) and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome with unknown genetic background. Patients were recruited to the registry and patient material was deposited in biomaterial banks (DNA/serum). In addition, basic research projects were initiated that focus on molecular mechanisms of AID. RESULTS: During the first 9 months, 117 patients (65 males, 52 females; age 1-21 years) have been recorded and classified as FMF (n=84), HIDS (n=1), TRAPS (n=3) and CAPS (n=1); clinically confirmed AID (n=5); SoJIA (n=22); and PFAPA (n=1). One hundred and fifty blood samples of 18 patients were included in biomaterial banks. CONCLUSION: Recruitment and follow-up of patients with AID will enable us to comprehensively address the correlation between clinical and epidemiological data, genetics and biomarkers. The translational approach may help to identify genetic or inflammatory markers relevant for the course and outcome of diseases.
