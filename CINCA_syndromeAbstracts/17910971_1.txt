The Cinca River is a tributary of Ebro River in the NE of Spain which receives input from different activities. One of the most important is related to an industry where DDT is used as an intermediate in the production of dicofol. This study evaluated the DDT contamination along the Cinca River. Sampling sites were selected up- and downstream from this industry. Sediments and fishes (59 bleaks (Alburnus alburnus) and 23 barbels (Barbus graellsi)) were collected in 2002 and analyzed using a new and rapid selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) method. DDT and its metabolites were found in sediments and fishes at levels ranging from 9 to 94microg kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.) and from not detected to 2098microg kg(-1) wet weight (w.w.), respectively. The highest values corresponded to samples collected just downstream the industry. Thirty kilometers downstream from the factory, levels were clearly lower, showing a weakening of the impact. p,p'-DDE isomer comprised up to 50% and 70% of total DDT measured in sediment and fish, respectively. When compared with values obtained in a previous study in 1999, a generalized drop of the levels in all matrixes (77-97%), was observed. No meaningful differences were found between the two fish species studied neither between the two tissues (muscle and liver) analyzed.
