The evolution over time of the levels and distribution of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in water, surface sediments, and fish from the River Cinca (Spain), a tributary of the River Ebro, during the period 1999 to 2004, was investigated by means of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The sampling site corresponded to a point downstream from Monz√≥n, a heavily industrialized town with drainage into the river. This river has historically been a source of emissions of DDT and its metabolites. The highest levels were found in 1999 and 2000, although the concentrations of organic compounds in sediments and fish have decreased since then. The levels of DDT in water were below the quantification limit during the period of study. The average composition of DDT isomers measured in sediments and fish showed the prevalence of p,p'-DDE, the product of aerobic degradation of p,p'-DDT. Concentrations in fish were compared with sediment samples, and high quotients indicate that they are highly bioavailable.
