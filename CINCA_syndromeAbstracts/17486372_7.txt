Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a subset of autoinflammatory diseases. It is characterized by recurrent inflammatory crises associated with fever, abdominal pain, persistent urticaria, arthralgia, sensorineural deafness, and possible development of multiorgan amyloid A protein (AA)-type amyloidosis. Mutations in the CIAS1 gene have been reported in MWS. Interleukin 1B (IL-1B) probably plays a major role in the pathophysiology of the disease, and IL-1B blockade may be therapeutic for this syndrome. We report here a Turkish child with MWS treated with anakinra. A novel mutation (I480F) was identified in exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene in this patient. The resolution of inflammatory symptoms, normalization of serological values, and improvement in hearing was noted with anakinra treatment.
