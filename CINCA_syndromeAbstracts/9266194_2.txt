A case of chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome in a Japanese girl, started at the age of 13 days with episodes of fever, rash followed by swollen joint, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy and chronic central nervous system involvement, is reported. Some of the findings suggest that this syndrome may be the result of an intrauterine infection. This is the first case of CINCA syndrome in a Japanese girl.
