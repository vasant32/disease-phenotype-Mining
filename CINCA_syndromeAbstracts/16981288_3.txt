 OBJECTIVE: Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is a rare, hereditary disorder characterized by cold-induced inflammation. We describe the successful longterm treatment of a patient with FCAS with anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). The remarkable response of FCAS and associated Raynaud's disease in this patient suggests that IL-1 is an important mediator of these inflammatory diseases. Our report supports increasing evidence that anakinra plays an important role in the treatment of select chronic inflammatory diseases.
