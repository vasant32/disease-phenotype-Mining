Hypothyroidism may coexist with different renal pathologies. This article describes three cases with hypothyroidism and different renal pathologies. The first patient had hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome due to renal amyloidosis and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS). The second patient had hypothyroidism and associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).
