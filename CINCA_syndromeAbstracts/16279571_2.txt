 BACKGROUND: Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)/chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, and articular syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by urticarial rash, arthropathy, and central nervous system inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To describe a 13-year-old girl with overlapping symptoms of NOMID and Muckle-Wells syndrome who has a mutation in cryopyrin (NALP3). METHODS: We examined neutrophil migration using transwell assay and time-lapse videomicroscopy. We also examined p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in patient and control neutrophils using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Neutrophil defects in chemotactic migration were found to a variety of chemoattractants, including interleukin 8, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, complement C5a, and leukotriene B4. Her neutrophils exhibited elevated basal and stimulated p38 MAPK activation in response to interleukin 8, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, complement C5a, and leukotriene B4. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate defects in neutrophil chemotaxis and p38 MAPK signaling in a patient with NOMID and Muckle-Wells syndrome and a cryopyrin mutation.
