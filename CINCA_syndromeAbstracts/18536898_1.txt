We report a case of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SOJIA), the manifestations of which started with fever and skin rash followed by arthritis within neonatal age. Such presentation is extremely rare in the newborn. After exclusion of closely mimicking conditions like congenital infections, neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), neonatal; lupus erythematosus (NLE) diagnosis of SOJIA may be entertained even in a neonate where arthritis, fever and rash are the presenting features.
