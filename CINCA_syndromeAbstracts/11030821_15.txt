OBJECTIVE: To report on the ocular manifestations of the Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous and Articular/Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (CINCA/NOMID) syndrome, a rare, recently identified, pediatric multisystem inflammatory disease with chronic cutaneous, neurological, and articular manifestations. DESIGN: Descriptive case-report study. SETTING: International collaborative study based on a questionnaire. RESULTS: We included 31 patients. The mean age at onset of eye manifestations was 4.5 years. Optic disc changes were the most common feature, occurring in 26 patients (83%), including optic disc edema, pseudopapilledema, and optic atrophy. Anterior segment manifestations varying from mild to severe were seen in 13 patients (42%); chronic anterior uveitis, in 17 patients (55%). Moderate to severe visual acuity loss in at least 1 eye was seen in 8 patients (26%) as a consequence of the disease. Posterior synechia, glaucoma, and white iritis were not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations with potentially sight-threatening complications occur commonly in the CINCA/NOMID syndrome. The distinctive nature of these complications may assist the ophthalmologist in recognizing this rare disorder and distinguishing it from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
