We report on a 22-year-old girl with a history of recurrent febrile episodes, chronic arthritis, urticarial rash, and neurological symptoms including right hemiparesis, internal hydrocephalus, mental retardation, progressive deafness, and visual impairment. Treatment starting at age 20 months, including different combinations of immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids and anti-TNFalpha antibody, was unsuccessful. Four years ago, we found a heterozygous S595G mutation in the NLRP3 gene of this patient. This prompted us to introduce anakinra, which resulted in considerable improvement of the patient's complaints.
