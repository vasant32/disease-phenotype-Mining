Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) is a rare disorder involving a triad of arthropathy, rash, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We describe a girl with NOMID who presented with typical neonatal rash, arthropathy, fever, and failure to thrive, but has not developed evidence of ocular or CNS involvement. This case illustrates the spectrum of involvement seen in NOMID. Histopathology of the skin demonstrated neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, a unique finding, which may serve as a diagnostic clue in patients with this rare disorder.
