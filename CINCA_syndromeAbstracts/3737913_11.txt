Infantile-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (IOMID) is a newly recognized disease that is similar to systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). The clinical symptoms of IOMID include rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, chronic meningitis, uveitis, and a distinct arthropathic condition. Skeletal involvement is surprisingly constant. The long bones become short, bowed, and widened. The metaphyses flare and simulate rickets. Grotesque epiphyses appear fragmented early in the course of the disease but are gradually incorporated into the widened shafts. We observed these and other radiologic findings in the four cases described in the present study. The findings are distinctive and allow for a specific diagnosis.
