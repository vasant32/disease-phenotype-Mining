Chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease, defined by the triad of urticarial rash, neurological manifestations, and arthropathy, accompanied by recurrent fevers and systemic inflammation. Increasing neurological deficits result from aseptic meningitis. Sensorineural hearing loss and progressive loss of vision caused by keratoconjunctivitis or papilloedema may emerge. An autosomal-dominant inheritance is suspected although sporadic cases are reported frequently. Sixty per cent of CINCA patients carry mutations in the cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (CIAS1) gene. We report the favourable response of a 23-year-old CINCA patient without CIAS1 mutations to treatment with the recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist anakinra.
