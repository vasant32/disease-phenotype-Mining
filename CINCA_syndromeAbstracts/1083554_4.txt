At a consultation with a 31-year-old man, motivated by painful episodes of joint pain that had started considerably earlier, a familial disease entity was discovered that included the three clinical signs of the Muckle and Wells syndrome : urticarial eruption, intermittent pain in the limbs originating in the joints, and bilateral deafness of perception. In spite of the absnece of renal amylosis, the similarity of the characteristics of these three elements, as well as the nature of the biochemical disturbances, and the mode of transmission, led the authors to consider these observations in the contest of this syndrome. The joint manifestations being indicative, the signs of this intermittent rheumatism are described, as well as the characteristics of the other disorders.
