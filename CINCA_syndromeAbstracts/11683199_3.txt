CINCA/IOMID is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology that resembles congenital infection and systemic juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). This disorder is characterized by neonatal onset, persistent rash, ocular inflammatory lesions, and progressive articular and neurological involvement. We report two new patients with this syndrome. Both children presented periodic bouts of cutaneous rash, fever, organomegaly, articular involvement with typical radiological features, and developmental delay. One of the patients presented neonatal jaundice and elevation of liver enzymes; inflammatory infiltrates were observed in the liver biopsy. The other patient showed retinal vasculitis detected at age 18 mo on fundoscopy and fluorescent angiography. Therapy with azathioprine was associated with prolonged remission of this complication. In both cases, the disease was diagnosed after some delay. Conclusion: Early hepatitis and retinal vasculitis are rare features of CINCA/IOMID that may help differentiate this syndrome from JRA. Azathioprine may have induced the remission of vasculitis in one case.
