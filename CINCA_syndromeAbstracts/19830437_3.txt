The understanding of the genetic and immunological basis of human periodic fever syndromes, in particular cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), has led to important new insights into the pathogenesis of monogenic and complex interleukin-1beta-associated autoinflammatory diseases. Currently the focus of attention is on the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLR), which take part in the regulation of the synthesis and maturation of cytokines in the IL-1 families, NOD-signalosomes and inflammasomes.
