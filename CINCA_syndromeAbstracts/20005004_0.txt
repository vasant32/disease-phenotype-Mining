CINCA syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease in childhood characterized by multisystemic manifestations: cutaneous, articular, and neurological including sensory organs. We report the case of homozygous twins affected by CINCA syndrome. The diagnosis was evoked on the basis of multiple systemic symptoms (multiple episodes of fever of unknown origin, mental retardation, short stature, meningitis, hearing loss, bilateral papilledema) and confirmed by the presence of a CIAS1 mutation on genetic analysis. After few months of treatment by anakinra (an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) the children began to grow again and we noted regression of the biological inflammatory syndrome.
