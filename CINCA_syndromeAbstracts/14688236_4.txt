Coculture of mouse bone marrow-derived immature mast cells (BMMC) with Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) promotes morphological and functional maturation toward a connective tissue mast cell (CTMC)-like phenotype, which is accompanied by increased expression of several unique genes. Here we report the molecular identification of one of them, mast cell maturation-associated inducible gene (MMIG)-1. The MMIG-1 cDNA encodes a 117-kDa cytosolic protein that comprises an N-terminal PYRIN domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and nine C-terminal leucine-rich repeats. MMIG-1 shows >85% sequence similarity to human cryopyrin/PYPAF1, a causal gene for familial cold urticaria and Muckle-Wells syndrome. MMIG-1 was distributed in the cytosol of CTMC-like differentiated BMMC. MMIG-1 underwent alternative splicing in the leucine-rich repeats and each variant was induced differently in BMMC during coculture. Moreover, its expression was increased in the ears of mice with experimental atopic dermatitis. Thus, MMIG-1, a likely mouse PYPAF1 ortholog, may play a role in mast cell-directed inflammatory diseases.
