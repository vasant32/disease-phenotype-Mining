The term Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) describes an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by various combinations of urticaria, sensorineural deafness, amyloidosis, arthralgia and skeletal abnormalities. We describe a family with nephropathy and several symptoms of MWS, but no evidence of deafness or amyloidosis. Since nephropathy without amyloidosis has never been reported in MWS, but deafness is a feature of all reported pedigrees, we conclude that members of this family have a previously unreported inherited predisposition to urticaria, arthralgia and nephropathy which is distinct from the MWS phenotype.
