Interleukin (IL)-1 is a pivotal proinflammatory cytokine consisting of two molecular species, IL-1α and IL-1β. Anakinra (Kineret), a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, is regarded as a biological agent which blocks the inflammatory effects of IL-1. The aim of this review was to search the literatures and summarizes in vivo, in vitro and human studies on anakinra uses in dermatological disorders. The results show that anakinra is currently used clinically for the treatment of a variety of skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, photoagaing, melanoma, Schnitzler syndrome, pyoderma gangraenosum, PAPA syndrome, hidradenitis suppurativa, lamellar ichthyosis, Sweet's syndrome, panniculitis, Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, SAPHO syndrome and other disorders. Notably, anakinra is expensive to produce and administer. Injection is the route of therapy and allergic reaction is most possible.
