Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a rare condition characterized by urticaria, arthralgias, deafness and amyloid nephropathy. The arthropathy is poorly documented. We describe the arthropathy occurring in four cases of MWS and discuss the management. Each patient developed recurrent bouts of transient synovitis. One patient developed a persistent sterile pyoarthrosis.
