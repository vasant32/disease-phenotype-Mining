We present a 6 year old boy with chronic urticaria of neonatal onset associated in childhood with features of neurological and joint inflammation. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of neonatal onset multi-inflammatory disorder (NOMID). Daily subcutaneous anti-IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy resulted in a dramatic and sustained amelioration of systemic inflammation. NOMID must be considered in any child with chronic urticaria of neonatal/infantile onset, particularly if associated with joint and/or neurological inflammation.
