Muckle Wells syndrome is an autoinflammatory disease in the group of cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). We report the case of an 8 year old girl with MWS who presented with remitting fever, urticaria, remitting coxitis, osteitis, bilateral uveitis anterior, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Serum amyloid A (SAA) and progressive sensoneurinal hearing loss. After starting treatment with anakinra, clinical symptoms dissolved almost completely for about two years now. CRP and SAA levels normalized quickly and sustained and as a consequence the risk of amyloidosis may be minimized. Notable is the complete recovery from sensoneurinal hearing loss merely two months after start of treatment. This brings up questions about pathophysiology of sensoneurinal hearing loss in MWS and emphasizes the benefits of an early diagnosis, as an early start of treatment possibly reduces long-term damage.
