A 14-year-old Japanese girl had a lifelong history of skin lesions developing after generalized exposure to cold air; the lesions were often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and chills. The skin lesions were non-pruritic, maculopapular, erythematous eruptions and were neither urticarial nor angioedematous. An ice-cube test was negative. Laboratory examinations showed marked leucocytosis during an acute attack. On the basis of clinical features, histological findings and laboratory data, although these symptoms were sporadic, the most likely diagnosis was familial polymorphous cold eruption, which has also been referred to as familial cold urticaria. Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 6 were significantly elevated during an acute attack after cold exposure, suggesting that both cytokines played important parts in the development of her condition.
