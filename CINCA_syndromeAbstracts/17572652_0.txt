 OBJECTIVE: To report the efficacy and adverse events with the use of anti-TNFalpha agents in pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, observational clinical case series of patients with rheumatic diseases refractory to the conventional treatment. Infliximab and etanercept were the the drugs used. RESULTS: Thirty patients received anti-TNFalpha therapy: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (18), chronic idiopathic anterior uveitis (2), juvenile dermatomyositis (4), Blau syndrome (1), relapsing polychondritis (2), CINCA syndrome (1), and microscopic polyangiitis (1). Twenty (66,6%) patients used infliximab exclusively, 2 (6,6%) etanercept and 8 (26,6%) both drugs. The response with infliximab was good in 9 patients, partial in 12 and poor in 5. Two patients were not evaluated for the short period of treatment. The response with etanercept was good in 7, partial in 2 and poor in 1. The best benefits were observed in JIA patients with polyarticular arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis. Adverse effects occurred in 15 patients (50%). Suspension of the treatment due to adverse events occurred in 7. The most frequent infusion reactions with the infliximab were cough and nausea. Infectious complications occurred in 2 patients receiving etanercept and in 7 receiving infliximab (one death due to sepsis). No patients developed tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Infliximab and etanercept are effective in some subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other rheumatic diseases refractory to conventional therapy. Although frequent, adverse events could be controlled most of the time.
