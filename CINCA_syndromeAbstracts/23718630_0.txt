INTRODUCTION: Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by excessive Interleukin-1 (IL-1) release, resulting in recurrent fevers, sensorineural hearing loss, and amyloidosis. IL-1-inhibition with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, improves clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers. Subclinical disease activity is commonly observed. Canakinumab, a fully human IgG1 anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, can abolish excess IL-1beta. The study aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of these two anti-IL-1 therapies. METHODS: Two cohorts of patients with severe MWS and confirmed NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) mutation were treated with anakinra and/or canakinumab. Clinical and laboratory features including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and the neutrophil marker S100A12 were determined serially. Disease activity was captured by MWS disease activity scores (MWS-DAS). Remission was defined as MWS-DAS [less than or equal to] 5 plus normal CRP and SAA. Treatment efficacy and safety were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 12 anakinra- and 14 canakinumab-treated patients; the median age was 33.5 years (3.0 - 72.0); 57% were females. Both treatment regimens led to a significant reduction of clinical disease activity and inflammatory markers. At last follow-up, 75% of anakinra-treated and 93% of canakinumab-treated patients achieved remission. During follow-up, S100A12 levels mirrored recurrence of disease activity. Both treatment regimens had favorable safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1 blockade is an effective and safe treatment in MWS patients. MWS-DAS in combination with MWS inflammatory markers provides an excellent monitoring tool set. Canakinumab led to a sustained control of disease activity even after secondary failure of anakinra therapy. S100A12 may be a sensitive marker to detect subclinical disease activity.
