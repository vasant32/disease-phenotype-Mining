 OBJECTIVE: In the past 8 years, 120 cases of hematological disorders were transplanted from the HLA identical donors. METHOD: Using chemotherapy based conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg and busulfan 15-16 mg/kg, 80 cases of beta-thalassemia major and 35 cases of leukemia and five patients with aplastic anemia had received bone marrow transplantation. RESULT: The five-year-survival in thalassemic group was 72%, for leukemic group (acute and chronic) was 58%, and also for aplastic anemia 65%. Transplantation related mortality was the cause of death in 29 cases. The two major causes of death were acute graft versus host disease and poor medical condition of patients before marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: At the present time, allogenic marrow transplantation is curative mode of treatment for many hematological diseases.
