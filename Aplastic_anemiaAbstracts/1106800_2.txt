A boy with severe Aplastic Anemia (AA) and a girl with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in relapse have been grafted with marrow from HL-A identical, mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) negative siblings after appropriate immunosuppressive and antileukemic therapy. Both of them are well 7 and 2 months after transplantation respectively. Bone marrow transplantation should be considered in children with AA and ALL in relapse, if HL-A identical, MLC negative siblings are available.
