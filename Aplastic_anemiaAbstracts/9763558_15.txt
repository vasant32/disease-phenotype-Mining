Between 1970 and 1996, 333 patients with severe aplastic anemia underwent HLA-matched related marrow transplant after conditioning with cyclophosphamide (CY). Thirty-five percent of patients transplanted between 1970 and 1976 (group 1), 12% of those transplanted between 1977 and 1981 (group 2), and 9% of patients transplanted between 1982 and 1997 (group 3) had graft rejection. Graft rejection occurred later among group 3 patients (median, 180 days) than among those in groups 1 and 2 (medians, 28 and 47 days, respectively; P < .001 group 3 v 2). In group 3, 92% of rejecting patients underwent a second transplant, compared with 78% and 77% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group 1 patients received various conditioning regimens before second transplant, whereas most patients of groups 2 and 3 received CY combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after second transplant consisted of methotrexate (MTX) for all group 1 and 2 patients, whereas group 3 patients received MTX combined with cyclosporine (CSP). Over the three time periods studied, first graft rejection decreased from 35% to 9%, and the proportion of rejecting patients undergoing second transplants increased from 77% to 92%. The 10-year probability of survival after second transplants increased from 5% to 83%. Multivariate analysis showed MTX/CSP GVHD prophylaxis to be a significant factor accounting for the increase in patient survival after second transplant.
