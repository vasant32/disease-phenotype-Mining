We report a case of severe and fatal aplastic anemia during an episode of infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr (EB) virus infection. The 13-year-old female patient had shown normal hematological findings and had previously undergone repeated chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation for refractory non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma (NHL). She was probably in an immuno-suppressed condition prior to this episode of infection. The possible causal relationship of the EB virus infection in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia was documented by the clinical course, demonstration of EB virus genome in the bone marrow cells, and an elevated plasma interferon (IFN)-gamma level.
