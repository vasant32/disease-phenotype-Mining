We report a rare case of sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a 6-year-old boy that occurred after bone marrow transplantation for his aplastic anemia. The clinical manifestation and histopathologic findings were typical of scleroderma. Although various kinds of treatment have been tried for scleroderma, no established therapy exists. Furthermore, treating this disease is even more difficult in children. In the future, clarification of the pathogenesis of chronic GVHD and establishment of therapy will be necessary.
