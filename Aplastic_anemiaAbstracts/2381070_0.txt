A 61 year old woman was admitted to our hospital suffering from severe pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed marked hypoplasia with 24.8% plasma cells. There was a small amount of IgA type M protein in serum. Multiple myeloma was ruled out on the basis that 1) the amount of serum IgA-M protein was minimal and no increase was observed, 2) no indication of monoclonality of bone marrow plasma cells was shown by immunofluorescent staining of immunoglobulins, 3) neither bone lesion nor other symptoms related to multiple myeloma were observed. Therefore, a diagnosis of aplastic anemia was made, and bolus methylprednisolone therapy (1,000 mg/day x 3 days) was performed, which brought the patient to complete remission. An oral dose of 15 mg of prednisolone is administered daily now and the remission state is being maintained. Bolus methylprednisolone therapy is performed quite often for the treatment of aplastic anemia. However, there are few reports in which remission was reached with the use of glucocorticoids alone, most having used androgens or other supportive drugs in conjunction. Here, we will discuss this case of aplastic anemia which responded to repeated bolus methylprednisolone therapy, with minimal side effects, and discuss its effectiveness. In addition, aplastic anemia associated with idiopathic monoclonal gammopathy is not reported, so this case is interesting immunologically.
