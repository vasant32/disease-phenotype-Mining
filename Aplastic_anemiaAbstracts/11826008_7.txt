We describe a case of primary cutaneous mucormycosis (zygomycosis) in a patient with idiopathic aplastic anemia which responded to surgical debridement and therapy with liposomal amphotericin B. The tissue removed at surgery showed dense infiltration with fungal hyphae on histopathological examination. Primary cultures of tissue on solid media were negative, but Absidia corymbifera was isolated from unprocessed tissue placed in brain heart infusion broth.
