Eighty-six patients suffering from hematological malignancies, immunodeficiencies, and aplastic anemias received alloHSCT from unrelated donors. Donors were selected from the BMDW files and further matching was performed according to the confirmatory typing procedure with the use of PCR SSP and that based on sequencing. The time from the clinical request of the donor search to the final decision of clinicians accepting the donor was from 0.3 to 17.8 months (median 1.6). Matching was analyzed at the allele level, and 50, 27, and 9 donor-recipient pairs were 10/10 matched, mismatched in one or more alleles, respectively. In an univariate analysis we found better survival if patients were transplanted: (i) from donors matched 10/10 (P = 0.025), (ii) not from female donor to male recipient (P = 0.037), (iii) in female donation from those with â‰¤1 pregnancy than multiparous (P = 0.075). Notably, it became apparent that duration of the confirmatory typing process affected the survival (HR = 1.138, P = 0.013). In multivariate analysis only the level of matching and the duration of the matching procedure significantly affected the survival. In conclusion, the duration of the matching procedure in addition to the level of matching should be considered as an independent risk factor of survival.
