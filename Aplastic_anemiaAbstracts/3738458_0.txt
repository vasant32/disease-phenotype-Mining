Corynebacterium species can normally be found on the skin and mucous membranes but rarely cause infections. They are sensitive to most antibiotics. Two patients with severe aplastic anemia undergoing antilymphocyte globulin therapy developed septicemia with a highly antibiotic-resistant corynebacterium (JK-group) only sensitive to vancomycin. Both patients had prolonged severe neutropenia, defects of the mucocutaneous barrier and intensive antibiotic treatment for gram negative infections. In both cases surveillance cultures already revealed the causative microorganism before fever started. One patient was even colonized with corynebacterium for several months before. If this strain is detected in the blood when new fever develops during prolonged neutropenia and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, it indicates serious infection in these highly compromised patients. Both cases illustrate that regular microbial surveillance can help to reveal colonization of high risk patients with multiple antibiotic-resistant corynebacterium strains and thus allow early initiation of treatment with vancomycin, which is the only effective antibiotic.
