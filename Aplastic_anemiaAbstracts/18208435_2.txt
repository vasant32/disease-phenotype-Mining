T1D after BMT constitutes a human model of autoimmune disease transmission. This case report refers to T1D onset after allogeneic HLA-matched BMT in a six-yr-old recipient affected by aplastic anemia. The donor was his sister who had T1D. The recipient had a complication free course apart from grade 1 acute GVHD, which was resolved spontaneously. With the predictive value and significance of T1D-associated autoantibodies, we tried to consolidate the T1D transfer possibility based on our patient characteristics and a literature review.
