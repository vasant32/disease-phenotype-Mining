We report a 61-year-old man with aplastic anemia who underwent successful off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) after being admitted for angina pectoris. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Preoperative WBC was 2,200/microl, neutrophil 704/microl, Hb 8.1g/dl, and PLT 16,000/microl. We conducted OPCAB on double vessels using left internal thoracic and radial artery grafts. Thirty units of platelets were transfused intraoperatively with little perioperaive hemorrhage. Because of high grade fever, we injected 150 microg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) every 3 days postoperatively to prevent major infection. The combination of appropriate perioperative management and OPCAB yielded an effective result for a patient with severe hematological disorders causing pancytopenia.
