A 19-year-old female with aplastic anemia who developed subglottal aspergillosis is reported. She presented with fever, cough and stridor. Inspiratory dyspnea progressed rapidly and emergent tracheostomy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. In spite of intensive anti-fungal treatment combined with adoptive immunotherapy, Aspergillus infection expanded and she died of pulmonary aspergillosis. Autopsy revealed the fungal mass obstructing the trachea and disseminated pulmonary aspergillosis. Difficulties in diagnosis and management of subglottal Aspergillus infection are discussed.
