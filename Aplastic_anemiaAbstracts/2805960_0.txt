Fourteen patients with severe aplastic anemia were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). Eight were studied with co-culture of patient's lymphocytes with normal bone marrow cells. Suppression of CFU-C was prevented by pretreatment of T lymphocytes with anti-T lymphocyte McAb in four patients and concordance with clinical outcome was observed only in two patients. Conclusive in vivo therapy result for this correspondence are lacking. Seven patients received fetal liver cell suspension infusion 24-36 hours after completing ALG therapy and remission were "more complete" in three cases with good response. Response of treatment in the fourteen patients was as follows: eight had complete or partial responses and the remaining did not respond or died (42.8%).
