Sulfasalazine, a commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, can cause an allergic reaction with hepatotoxicity, lymphadenopathy, and rash. In addition, many hematologic complications have been observed with sulfasalazine, including aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and erythroid hypoplasia. However, thrombocytopenia in association with sulfasalazine hypersensitivity has not been previously reported. We report a child who developed severe thrombocytopenia and anemia during a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine.
