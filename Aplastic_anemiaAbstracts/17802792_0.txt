AIM: To study clinical and laboratory characteristics of hepatitides and evaluate efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy and transplantation of the bone marrow in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of case histories of children with HAAA was made. For all the patients standard tests for detection of aquired aplastic anemia and hepatitis were conducted. Transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells (THSC) from HLA-identical donors was made in 4 patients, 25 patients were treated with combined immunosuppressive therapy (antithymocytic globulin--ATG plus cyclosporin A -CsA), one patients received monotherapy with CsA, two--prednisolone and a short course of CsA, one child was untreated. RESULTS: Of 260 children admitted to hospital from April 1989 to July 2005 for aquired aplastic anemia, 33 (12.7%) met diagnostic criteria of HAAA. Boys to girls ratio was 267. Hepatitides were severe: median of alaninaminotransferase concentration was 1215 IU/l, aspartataminotransferase--789 IU/l, bilirubin--152.5 mcmol/l. Median of the interval from hepatitis symptoms to documentation of pancytopenia was 66 days (0-204 days). All four patients after THSC are alive for 30-72 months. Probability of complete remission after the first course of ATG+CsA is 0.72 +/- 0.09, probability of survival 0.81 +/- 0.07, median of the interval to transfusion independence--50 days. CONCLUSION: HAAA prognosis is good only in administration of up-to-date therapy. After seronegative hepatitis it is necessary to control hemogram parameters and in the presence of minimal cytopenia patients should be directed to hematological hospital.
