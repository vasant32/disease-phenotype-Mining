Human parvovirus B19, which is most commonly known to cause erythema infectiosum in children, is also known to cause infection in adults, with complications ranging from a self-limited polyarthropathy in immunocompetent patients to hydrops fetalis in pregnant women, transient aplastic crises in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias, and chronic aplastic anemia in immunocompromised hosts. We describe a previously healthy immunocompetent woman who presented with manifestations of acute parvovirus B19 infection.
