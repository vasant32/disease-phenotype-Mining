Umbilical cord blood as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells and nonmyeloablative conditioning are very exciting new developments in transplantation. We report here mixed chimerism in two adult patients with severe aplastic anaemia using nonmyeloablative conditioning and two-antigen mismatched cord blood transplantation resulting in satisfactory clinical response. Our results suggest that such transplant is possible with minimal toxicity.
