Various clinical and immunological extrahepatic manifestations were described during infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV). We reported a rare association, within the same patient, made up with a cutaneous leucytoclastic vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia. A 70 years old woman with infection by HCV diagnosed four years ago, was hospitalized due to upper members purpura and six cutaneous ulcerations. Complete blood count revealed a pancytopenia. Prothrombin time was at 65%, AST, ALT an d GT were within normal limits. Test for antibodies to HCV en serum was positive. Bone marrow aspiration showed marked hypocellularity. A skin biopsy showed leucocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels. Interferon a therapy was not indicated because aplastic anemia. Simultaneous occurrence of cutaneous vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia during HCV infection lays the question of their mechanism. Purpura and cutaneous ulcerations can be due to cryoglobulinia.
