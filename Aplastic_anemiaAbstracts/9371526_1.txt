Serum insulin, and plasma glucagon and glucose levels were measured in 56 Chinese patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and 40 normal controls. Serum insulin and plasma glucose levels in 18 newly diagnosed cases and 11 previously treated cases with prednisone were significantly higher than those in the controls. Serum insulin and plasma glucose levels in 27 cases previously treated with stanozolol were significantly higher than those in the newly diagnosed cases and the previously treated cases with prednisone. There was no significant difference in plasma glucagon levels between the patients and the controls. Serum insulin and plasma glucose levels were significantly correlated with the amount of blood transfusions and serum ferritin and cortisone concentrations in the AA patients. Our findings suggest that AA patients may have hyperinsulinemia accompanying hyperglycemia, which can be further aggravated by stanozolol and prednisone therapy and iron overload.
