The signal intensity of hematopoietic regions in the marrow of aplastic anemia were investigated on opposed phase T1-weighted images (op-T1WI) with a 0.5-Tesla MR unit. Hematopoietic regions were classified into two groups : 1) low intensity hematopoietic areas (LH) isointense to normal marrow and 2) high intensity hematopoietic regions (HH) with higher intensity than normal marrow on op-T1WI. a) The signal intensity of LH was significantly lower than that of HH on STIR. b) LH converted in to HH with improvement of laboratory data after therapy, whereas HH decreased with impairment of data. c) In addition, HH were hyperintense to cerebrospinal fluid on op-T1WI. These results indicated that the signal intensity of hematopoietic regions on op-T1WI reflected the cellularity in these regions and that aplastic anemia included hypercellular regions relative to normal marrow.
