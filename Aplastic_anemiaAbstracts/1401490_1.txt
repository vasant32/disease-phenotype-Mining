Three epithelial neoplastic lesions, perineal Bowenoid papulosis, uterine cervical carcinoma, and bladder transitional cell carcinoma, which occurred in a mildly immunosuppressed patient who had aplastic anemia were studied for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In the Bowenoid papulosis, HPV type 16 DNA was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by in situ hybridization (ISH). In contrast, in the uterine cervical carcinoma, HPV 16 was not detected, although possibly another unidentified type of HPV in the lesion was suggested by the ISH findings. In the bladder transitional cell carcinoma, neither papillomavirus genus-specific (PGS) antigen nor HPV DNA was found.
