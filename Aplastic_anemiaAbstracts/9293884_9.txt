BACKGROUND: Auxiliary liver transplantation offers an alternative method to conventional transplantation in acute liver failure. It is especially challenging for children because lifelong immunosuppression may be avoided. However, experience with this procedure is rare and there is controversy about whether to place the graft orthotopically or heterotopically. METHODS: We present the case of a 3-year-old boy with acute liver failure due to non-ABC hepatitis complicated by aplastic anemia who underwent auxiliary liver transplantation. Segments 2 and 3 of the graft were implanted heterotopically in the right lower abdomen. RESULTS: Good liver function was immediately restored. Aplastic anemia resolved 3 weeks after transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued after 14 months, and the graft was left to atrophy. Thirty-nine months after transplantation the boy is alive and well with normal liver function tests and normal blood cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: Heterotopic auxiliary liver transplantation allowed recovery of the native liver in a child with acute liver failure and aplastic anemia due to non-ABC hepatitis.
