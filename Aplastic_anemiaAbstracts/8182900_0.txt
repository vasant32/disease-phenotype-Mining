In this study, we have investigated the clinical effectiveness of fluconazole (FLCZ) given intravenously or orally to pediatric patients with systemic fungal infections. FLCZ was administered intravenously to two patients with acute leukemia (multiple hepatosplenic candidiasis and aspergillosis) and orally to two mycosis complicated with neuroblastoma and aplastic anemia, respectively. Clinical efficacies were excellent and no side effects were observed in any patients. Pharmacokinetic analysis in 6 neonates revealed that the plasma half-life is 37-41 hours after administration of single dose of intravenous infusion of 3 mg/kg of FLCZ.
