63 patients with aplastic anemia were studied by using in vitro assay for committed erythroid and granulomonocytic progenitors from the bone marrow. The T cell-mediated effects of suppression of normal hematopoiesis were observed by PBMNC of the patients when cocultured with normal bone marrow. The stimulated effects of androgen on BFU-E and CFU-E with methyl testosterone were also studied. The results showed that the PBMNC of 44.4% of the 63 patients suppressed normal hematopoiesis. 41.3% of the patients responded to methyl testosterone (MT) and 14.3% of the patients had very obvious decrease or absence of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM without evidence of immunological effects or response to androgen. According to these findings, it may be useful for clinicians to choose better therapeutic regimens for aplastic anemia. Such as BMT for the patients with hematopoietic stem cells deficiency; immuno-suppression treatment or splenectomy may be of benefit for those who suffered from immune mediated aplastic anemia (IMAA) and androstenones chosen for those sensitive to MT in vitro. There were 15 patients with IMAA treated with immuno-suppressive agents and 19 patients sensitive to MT treated with androgens. All of them had satisfactory results.
