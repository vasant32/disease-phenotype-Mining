Aplastic anaemia is a potentially fatal haematopoietic disorder whose aetiology is not yet clarified. In our preliminary study we have introduced cyclosporin in the aplastic anaemia treatment to evaluate its effect on the disease evolution. Ten aplastic anaemia patients, mean age 33.33 +/- 20.01 years, were treated with cyclosporine (9 +/- 2.35 mg/kg/d), prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/d) and androgens (1 mg/kg/d). The prednisolone was always combined with cyclosporine. The androgens were administered concomitantly with the cyclosporine or alternately. Seven patients responded to the treatment after a median remission delay of 6 weeks (2-12 weeks). They became independent of blood requirements at a median of 36 weeks (8-108 weeks); the three other patients died during the first trimester without showing any improvement. Among the seven responders, two relapsed early and transiently. The rate of actuarial survival was 70 per cent. The median duration of survival was 10.5 months. The side effects observed included one case of malignant lymphoma, six cases of liver toxicity and five cases of kidney toxicity. This toxicity was reversible after dose adjustment of the cyclosporine. In our study, the introduction of cyclosporin in the aplastic anaemia treatment resulted in improved therapeutic response. Androgens should be used to maintain the haematologic response. This therapeutic protocol associated with drug monitoring seems promising and the side effects should not limit its use because of the severity of the underlying disease.
