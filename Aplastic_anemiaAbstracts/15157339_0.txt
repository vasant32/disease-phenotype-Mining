The aim of this study was to explore application value of detecting platelet associated antibody and platelet membrane glycoprotein in the diagnosis and prognosis for immune thrombocytopenia. The platelet associated immunoglobulin (PAIg) and platelet membrane glycoprotein (CD41, CD61, GPIIb/IIIa) in 76 cases of immune thrombocytopenia and 30 healthy subjects were determined by FCM. The results showed that PAIg level in ITP patients included PAIgG (31.25 +/- 18.06)%, PAIgM (32.41 +/- 15.51)%, PAIgA (23.39 +/- 16.67)% which were remarkedly higher than in health control (10.48 +/- 5.05)%, (9.40 +/- 4.42)% and (7.23 +/- 3.61)% (P < 0.001). In patients with secondary immune thrombocytopenia (chronic aplastic anemia, SLE, Evans syndrome, liver cirrhosis hypersplenism, etc), PAIg level was higher than that in control group, while the platelet membrane glycoprotein in the blood of these patients was lower than that in control group. The level of PAIg decreased (P < 0.05) after treatment, but platelet membrane glycoprotein increased (P < 0.01). The result suggested that measurements for platelet membrane glycoprotein and platelet associated antibody by FCM were practical with high sensitivity, rapidity and simplicity used as a routine method in diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effects in immune thrombocytopenia patients.
