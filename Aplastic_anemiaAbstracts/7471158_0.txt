Mice treated with high-dose busulfan develop a 'latent' form of bone marrow failure characterized by near-normal peripheral blood counts and marrow cellularity, but marked reductions in marrow pluripotent stem cells (CFUs) and myeloid progenitor cells (CFUc). Spleen cell suspensions from control and 'latent' mice were placed in liquid culture in the presence of colony-stimulating activity. Cells were harvested at intervals up to 14 days and sub-cultured in agar to assay for CFUc. Baseline splenic CFUc did not differ significantly between control and 'latent' mice. Splenic CFUc from control mice increased 50-fold and reached a peak at day 10 in liquid culture. In contrast, splenic CFUc from 'latent' mice increased only 7-fold and reached a peak at day 3. Our results indicate that although splenic CFUc are present in normal numbers in 'latent' mice, their proliferative capacity is markedly reduced, either as the result of defective CFUc self-renewal or defective feed-in from CFUs or both.
