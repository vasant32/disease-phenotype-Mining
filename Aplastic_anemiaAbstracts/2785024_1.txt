Severe aplastic anaemia was diagnosed in a 24-year-old woman in the 16th week of her pregnancy. She was delivered by cesarean section in the 35th week of a healthy boy, treatment in the intervening period having been exclusively by supportive measures. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation, planned after delivery, had to be cancelled owing to the sudden death of the female donor. Immunosuppressive treatment with antithymocyte globulin, corticosteroids and cyclosporin A failed to improve the haematological picture and the patient died one year after the delivery of intracerebral haemorrhage.
