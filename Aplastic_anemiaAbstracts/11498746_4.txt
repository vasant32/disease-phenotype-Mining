Autoimmune diseases can be transmitted and eliminated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). There have been several cases of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) occurring after BMT, but AITD remission has been rarely reported. We present four cases in which the remission or transfer of AITD occurred after an allogeneic BMT. Two patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) showed evidence of remission of Hashimoto's thyroiditis which they had before allogeneic BMT. One patient with SAA, which developed during treatment with propylthiouracil for Graves' disease, underwent allogeneic BMT and showed evidence of Graves' disease remission following BMT. In one patient, new AITD occurred after an allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling who already had AITD. These cases support the evidence that the immune system is newly reconstituted after BMT, and severe autoimmune disease can be an indication for BMT. To fully understand the real changes in autoimmune status after BMT, long-term prospective studies are necessary.
