In the year 1992, 203 teams in 26 countries in Europe performed a total of 6065 bone marrow transplantations (BMT). Transplant source in 2666 cases (44%) was an allogeneic donor, in 2171 cases an HLA-identical sibling donor, in 170 a non-identical family donor, in 29 a twin donor and in 296 cases an unrelated volunteer donor. There were 3399 autologous transplants (56%): 2494 autologous BMT, 644 autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants and 261 combined autologous BM and peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Indications for transplant were leukemias in 2963 patients (49%; 1987 allogeneic, 976 autologous), lymphoproliferative disorders in 1890 patients (31%; 201 allogeneic, 1689 autologous), solid tumors in 739 patients (12%; 10 allogeneic, 739 autologous), aplastic anemia in 194 patients (3%; 193 allogeneic, 1 autologous), thalassemia in 128 patients (2%; allogeneic), inborn errors in 115 patients (2%; allogeneic) and miscellaneous disorders in 36 patients (32 allogeneic, 4 autologous). Compared with an EBMT survey 2 years ago, there was an increase in the number of participating institutions and in the number of transplants performed from all sources. If the 142 teams reporting in 1990 and 1992 are compared alone, there is an increase in unrelated allogeneic BMT and in autologous BMT. There was an increase in autologous transplants for myeloma and lymphoma. These data confirm a continuing trend to apply BMT as a therapeutic modality.
