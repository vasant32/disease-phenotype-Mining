OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To elucidate the role of immunodysfunction in the pathogenesis of severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: HLA-DR+ T cells were detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of 20 SAA patients and controls (9 for BM and 11 for PB). PHA-LYCM conditioned medium was prepared, and its in vitro effect on normal bone marrow BFU-E and CFU-GM was studied. RESULTS: The percentages of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes in BM and PB of newly diagnosed SAA patients were significantly higher than that of controls (P<0.001), and that of recovered SAA (rSAA) patients after ALG therapy (P<0.05). Compared with controls, the PBA-LYCMs from newly diagnosed SAA patients showed significant inhibitory effect on normal BFU-E and CFU-GM (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The activated T lymphocyte may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SAA.
