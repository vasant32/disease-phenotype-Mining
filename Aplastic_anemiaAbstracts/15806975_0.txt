 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Shenfu injection (SFI) and influence on T-lymphocyte subset, serum level of interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-2(IL-2) in patients with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) based on treating with stanozol and cyclosporin A. METHOD: 60 patients with CAA were randomly divided into two groups, 30 patients in the SFI group were treated with SFI (100 mL which contains Ginsenoside 0.8 mg x mL(-1) and aconitine 1.8 microg x mL(-1) by adding it in 500 mL of 5% glucose every day) plus stanozol and cyclosporin A and 30 patients in the control group treated with slanozol and cyclosporin A alone for 2 months. The clinical efficacy was observed. The change of T-lymphocyte subset analyzed by flow cytometry and the levels of serum IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2 measured with ELISA method were also observed before and after treatment. RESULT: After treatment, the total effective rate of the SFI group was higher than that in the control group, but it did not showing significant difference. The CD4/CD8 levels were significantly increased (1.76+/-0.49, P< 0.01) and CD8 levels were significantly lowered (22.57+/-6.30, P < 0.01) in the SFI group after treatment. Serum levels of lFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2 were lower in both groups, and the level of TNF-alpha and IL-2 in the SFI group (0.710+/-0.213) ng x L(-1) and (0.639+/-0.247) ng x L(-1) was significantly lowered than that in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: SFI might believe the hemopoietic inhibition so as to promote the recovery of hemopoietic function through improving the T-lymphocyte subset and reducing the release of hemopoietic negative regulatory factors such as IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2.
