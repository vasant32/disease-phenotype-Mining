Mycotoxins such as beauvericin (BEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), enniatin B (ENB), fumonisin B1 (FB1), T-2 toxin and zearalenone (ZEA) can co-occur in food commodities. This aim of this study was to assess the myelotoxicity of these mycotoxins in couple using in vitro human granulo-monocytic (Colony Forming Unit-Granulocyte and Macrophage, CFU-GM) hematopoietic progenitors. Clonogenic assays have been performed in the presence of the following couples of fusariotoxins: DON + BEA, DON + FB1, DON + T-2, DON + ZEA, T-2 + ZEA and BEA + ENB. Co-exposure of human CFU-GM to DON + BEA resulted in synergic myelotoxic effects. The combination of DON + T-2 presented additive or synergic myelotoxic effects. The couples DON + ZEA, T-2 + ZEA and BEA + ENB had additive myelotoxic effects, while the combination of DON + FB1 showed antagonist myelotoxic effects. These in vitro results suggested that the simultaneous presence of mycotoxins in food commodities and diet may be more myelotoxic than the presence of one mycotoxin alone. Diminution of hematopoietic progenitors could give rise to a decrease number of mature blood cells, inducing agranulocytosis and/or thrombocytopenia and in severe cases aplastic anemia.
