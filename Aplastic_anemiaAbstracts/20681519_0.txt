This work employs an epitope mapping of carbonic anhydrase (CA), isoform I (CA I), for detection of the main immunodominant epitopes. Our interest has arisen from an observed spontaneous tumor regression in patients who developed an aplastic anemia type syndrome after a high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and whose sera contained high titer of anti carbonic anhydrase (anti-CA) autoantibodies. There are many indications that the presence of these autoantibodies may provide significant survival benefit for the patients. Western blot analysis confirmed strong immunoreactivity of the patients' sera with several CA isoforms and the CA I has been selected for our study as a highly abundant and widely distributed isoform. The applied analytical approach consists of specific fragmentation of CA I protein followed by immunospecific isolation of peptides reacting with polyclonal anti-CA I autoantibodies of patients in spontaneous remission. We improved the standard epitope mapping schema by incorporating the benefits of magnetic carriers and biomagnetic separation techniques. Mass spectrometry has been applied for detection and identification of epitopes and the acquired results were verified by bioinformatic tools. The candidate epitopes of CA I (NVGHS, DGLAV, SSEQL, and SLKPI) are discussed herein as potential therapeutic targets. This work highlights the usefulness of the epitope mapping technique based on magnetic microspheres for effective and rapid determination of immunodominant epitopes of the target protein.
