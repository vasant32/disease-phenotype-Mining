From September 1982 to August 1997, 767 bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants have been performed at the Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma. Five hundred and two (502) autologous transplants (AutoTX) preceded by high-dose myeloablative therapy were performed for breast cancer (BC, 36%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL, 24%), Hodgkin's disease (HD, 10%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 8%), testicular cancer (TC, 4%), multiple myeloma (MM, 2%) and other malignancies (16%). Two hundred and sixty-five (265) allogeneic marrow transplants (AlloTX) (related, unrelated) were carried out in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, 30%), AML (23%), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL, 14%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 9%), severe aplastic anemia (SAA, 8%), and other diseases (14%). Compared between 1980s to 1990s, 100-day mortality rates have decreased from 28% to 5% for AutoTX and from 40% to 25% for AlloTX. In the AutoTX setting, major changes included the routine use of growth factors post-transplant and the switch from bone marrow to growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood as a source of stem cells over the last five years. In the AlloTX setting, improvements in recognition and control of cytomegalovirus and Candida organisms, the selective use of growth factors and screened blood products, and better selection of unrelated donors using DNA-based techniques of HLA-matching have contributed to reduce early mortality from infection and primary graft failure. The five-year survival outcomes are comparable to those reported in registry data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP).
