OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of bone marrow stem cells from aplastic anemia patients and their in vitro responses to hemopoietic growth factors(HGF). METHODS: CD34 positive bone marrow cells from 10 chronic aplastic anemia(CAA), 5 severe aplastic anemia(SAA) patients and 5 healthy subjects were detected with immunoflurescence assay, enriched by Panning way, and then cultured in vitro for CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E in the presence of recombinant HGFs. RESULTS: CD34 positive rates of the bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) of CAA, SAA and control groups were (1.05 +/- 0.51)%, (0.70 +/- 0.37)% and (1.27 +/- 0.45)%, respectively, and there was no difference among them (P > 0.05). After being enriched, CD34 positive cells in MNC of CAA, SAA and control groups increased to a similar level(P > 0.05). In the presence of G-CSF or GM-CSF, the enriched CD34 positive MNC of CAA and SAA patients formed similar CFU-GM number to those of normal controls. The numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E formed from the enriched CD34 positive MNC of CAA and SAA patients were also the same as that of normal control groups under the stimulation of erythropoietin and interleukin-3. Stem cell factor could cooperate with G-CSF, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin significantly increasing the numbers of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E of CAA, SAA and normal control's enriched CD34 positive MNC. CONCLUSION: The bone marrow CD34 positive cells from aplastic anemia patients appears to be normal in percentages and in in vitro proliferation/differentiation capacities.
