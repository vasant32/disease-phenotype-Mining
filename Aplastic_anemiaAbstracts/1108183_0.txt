Histocompatibility testing has been performed in the families of 20 patients with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia, in order to identify a compatible donor for marrow transplantation. In several cases, the interpretation of the tests has been difficult because of abnormalities in the immune reactivity of patients' lymphocytes. Humoral or cellular immunization against donor incompatible antigens seems to prevent a "take" of the graft or a subsequent hematological remission.
