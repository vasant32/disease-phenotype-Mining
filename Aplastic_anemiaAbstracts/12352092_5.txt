 PURPOSE: To report the occurrence of bilateral macular hemorrhage following the use of azathioprine for immunosuppression in a corneal transplant recipient. METHODS: The patient underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for progressive fungal keratitis in his left eye. Although the infection did not recur, the graft failed with vascularization of the cornea in three quadrants. He underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty 2 years later and was treated with azathioprine (100 mg daily) to enhance graft survival. Four months after instituting azathioprine therapy, he developed aplastic anemia and macular hemorrhage in both eyes. RESULTS: Fluorescein angiography revealed a preretinal location of the macular hemorrhage. After cessation of azathioprine therapy and treatment with blood component replacement, hematological parameters improved and the macular hemorrhage cleared with good visual recovery during the next 2 months. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the serious ocular and systemic complications that can occur following the use of systemic immunosuppressants after ophthalmic surgery.
