OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ocular findings in aplastic anemia. DESIGN: Eighteen patients with aplastic anemia were examined. RESULTS: Ocular findings included cotton wool spots (38%), nerve fiber layer or preretinal hemorrhages (67%), vitreous hemorrhages (13%), a picture resembling central retinal vein occlusion (13%) and optic disk edema (6%). Preretinal hemorrhages were the presenting sign of aplastic anemia in 2 patients (13%). CONCLUSIONS: A blood profile is needed in patients with unexplained retinal hemorrhages. Patients with aplastic anemia need to avoid ocular massage and Valsalva maneuvers to decrease ocular morbidity.
