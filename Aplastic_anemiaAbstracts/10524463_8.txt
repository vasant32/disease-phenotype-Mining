This report is the first to describe constitutional aplastic anemia in a patient with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (also called poikiloderma congenitale), a disease characterized by multiple cutaneous and extracutaneous findings. The findings suggest that although Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is a rare disease, vigilance for the development of associated hematologic abnormalities is warranted.
