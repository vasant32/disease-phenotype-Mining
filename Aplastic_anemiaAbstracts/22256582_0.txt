A 32-year-old pregnant woman diagnosed with aplastic anemia was admitted for emergent caesarean delivery of 26th week of the gestation due to PIH (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and NRFS (non-reassuring fetal status). After compensating platelets counts to 5.3x10(4) microl-1, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with O2 and sevoflurane until delivery and with modified-NLA after delivery. She was additionally monitored with Vigileo/FloTrac system (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) and TOF-WATCH SX (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo). After 8 minutes of operation her baby was born with the 5-minute Apgar score of 5 and the UA-pH of 7.387. It was only 2 hours and 12 minutes that the baby was born after she was admitted. The baby was tracheally intubated and transferred to NICU. Blood loss during operation was 835 g and two units of RCC was transfused. Circulatory values were kept acceptable and neuromuscular blocking was completely reversed by sugammadex and extubated in the operating room. Bleeding tendency and atonic bleeding were not observed. She survived perioperative period and was to be treated for aplastic anemia. Her baby was discharged neurologically free. We should be ready to respond to anesthetic requirement for urgent cases of aplastic anemia.
