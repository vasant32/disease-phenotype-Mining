Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is rarely applied for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) because of questionable durability of engraftment and increased risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD). We performed allogeneic PBSCT in 3 SAA patients from their human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings. One received bone marrow after conditioning with cyclophoshamide (Cy) plus antithymocyte globulin. He had a second transplant with peripheral blood stem cells from the original donor because of a graft failure (GF). Two other patients received PBSCT as a first option, with Cy as the only conditioning drug. The 3 patients received short-term methotrexate and cyclosporine as a postgrafting immunosupression. In the latter 2 cases, no GF has been observed, and a successful and complete hematological recovery was achieved and maintained for 28 and 25 months, respectively. In conclusion, PBSCT provides a quick and complete hematological recovery in SAA patients.
