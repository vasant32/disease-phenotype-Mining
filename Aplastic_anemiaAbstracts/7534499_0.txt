Activation-associated antigens such as CD11b, CD14 and CD64 of neutrophils have been reported. Although CD48 is an activation antigen of lymphocytes and monocytes, whether it is an activation antigen of neutrophils has not previously been examined. Herein, using FACS analysis, we examined the expression of surface CD48 on neutrophils activated in vivo by G-CSF administered for the treatment of idiopathic aplastic anemia. CD48 expression was increased 24 h after the initial G-CSF infusion and peaked within 1 week. Within a few days after discontinuation of G-CSF administration, it returned to the pretreatment level. This indicates that CD48 is an activation antigen of neutrophils.
