 OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficiency and toxicity of non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NAST) for hematological disease. METHODS: Seventeen patients, including 3 acute myeloid leukemia, 6 chronic myelogenous leukemia, 4 severe aplastic anemia, 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 multiple myeloma and 1 myelodysplastic syndromes received NAST from HLA-identical sibling donors. Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized by G-CSF 300 microg/12 hours x 5 d. (2.15 -10.01) x 10(6) CD(34)(+) cells/kg were transplanted. A non-myeloablative conditioning regimen included fludarabine 30 mg.m(-2).d(-1) x 6 d;busulfan 4 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) x 2 d or cyclophosphamide 50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) x 2 d and antilymphocytic globulin 12 approximately 15 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) x 4 d. Cyclosporin A was used to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) alone and no G-CSF was administered after NAST. RESULT: Hematopoiesis reconstitution resumed on day 8 to day 19 (average of day 13). Severe mucositis was absent. Hepatic venoocclusive disease did not occur. Infectious complications were rare. Acute and chronic GVHD each occurred in 5 patients. Idiopathic pneumonia was developed in 5 patients. In the follow-up duration of 120 to 425 days, 16 of the 17 cases had a stable mixed or complete chimerical states. Fourteen of 17 patients are alive. CONCLUSION: NAST is an effective therapy in the treatment of hematological diseases with less complications, less blood transfusion and lower cost.
