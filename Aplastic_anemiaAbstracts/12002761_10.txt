Although systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a well-defined hematologic neoplasm, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate between SM and a reactive mast cell (MC) hyperplasia. We describe a patient with aplastic anemia who was treated with recombinant stem cell factor (SCF). In response to SCF, the patient showed transient hematologic improvement and developed a marked increase in MC as well as a transient increase in serum tryptase. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination revealed a huge increase in MC in the bone marrow with focal infiltrates similar to SM. However, most of the SM-criteria were not met: First, MC showed normal cytomorphological characteristics without significant atypias (no cytoplasmic extensions, no oval nuclei, no hypogranulated cytoplasm). Furthermore, bone marrow MC were CD2- and CD25-negative and did not exhibit the C-KIT 2468 A-->T mutation (Asp-816-Val). After discontinuation of SCF the MC hyperplasia resolved confirming its reactive nature. Based on our case and similar cases mimicking mastocytosis, it seems of importance to apply recently established SM criteria in order to discriminate between reactive MC hyperplasia and true mastocytosis with certainty.
