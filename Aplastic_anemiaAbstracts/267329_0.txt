Osteogenic sarcoma developed in a 14-year-old boy 13 years after he had partially recovered from chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia. A possible relationship is considered between aplastic anemia, chloramphenicol, testosterone, prednisone, and osteogenic sarcoma. Leukemia has been reported following chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia and liver tumors have been associated with testosterone therapy. Certain chemicals have caused osteogenic sarcoma in animals. Thus, we believe there are sufficient a priori reasons to question an etiologic relationship between the cause or treatment of aplastic anemia and osteogenic sarcoma.
