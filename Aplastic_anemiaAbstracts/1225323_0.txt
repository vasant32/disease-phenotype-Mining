Clinical symptomatology, pathohystiological characteris of bone marrow and the effects of treatment achieved in 21 patients with aplastic anaemia (a.a.) have been presented in this paper. Compared to one of our previous analised serie the number of patients with a.a. of both sexes and age has doubled for the last few years. The ethiogenesis in 14 cases was of unknown origin. In tree cases chloramphenicol was a cause, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria in three other cases and one appeared in pregnancy. Pathohystiology of bone marrow has in 7 cases acellular in 11 hypocellular and in tree partial hypercellular appearance. Immunohaematological examinations yielded positive antiglobuline tests in tree cases (out of 17 examined) and positive thrombocytic antibodies in 2 patients out of 14. Australia antigen has been found positive in 3 patients (out of 18), Au antibodies in one out of nine patients, while three developed manifest serum hepatitis duing the causee of treatment. Tree patients whose final diagnosis was paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria previosly were diagnosed and treted as a.a., while two with a.a. gave positive acid and sugar tests for that syndroma. The treatment in this seria of a.a. was by corticosteroids, testosteron. There has not been any significant impruvement in prolonging the patients lives in this seria comparing the previous one in which there had been given no anabolic hormones. Most of the patients (more than 50%) did not survive more than 24 months.
