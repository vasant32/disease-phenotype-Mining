Gallium 67 scanning is an effective method of detecting inflammatory lesions, especially abscesses. A 10-year-old boy with aplastic anemia and severe leukopenia and granulocytopenia had a psoas abscess diagnosed by gallium scan. The patient died with Candida spesis 18 days after bone marrow transplantation. At autopsy, a chronic psoas abscess with Candida was found. The gallium scan offers a clinically effective and noninvasive means of evaluating suspected infection in the granulocytopenic patient.
