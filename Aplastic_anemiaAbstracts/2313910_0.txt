A rare case of aplastic anemia which was considered to be induced by allopurinol was reported. A 48-year-old female had suffered from urolithiasis and chronic renal insufficiency. She was administered allopurinol for hyperuricemia for 4 months, and subsequently developed severe pancytopenia and bone marrow suppression. After stopping of allopurinol administration, she was administered prednisolone but died of gastro-intestinal tract bleeding and sepsis on the 21th hospital day, without hematological recovery.
