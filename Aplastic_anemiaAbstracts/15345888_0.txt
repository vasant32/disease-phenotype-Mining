 BACKGROUND: Elevated neutrophil myeloperoxidase may have a role in the diagnosis of megaloblastic erythropoiesis. AIMS: To study the differentiating role of myeloperoxidase index in megaloblastic and aplastic anemia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The myeloperoxidase index (MPXI) was studied in 96 patients with megaloblastic and aplastic anemia diagnosed on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy examinations. METHODS AND MATERIALS: MPXI was measured with Technicon H1 (Bayer) automated analyzer. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistical test was used to compare the MPXI values between groups. RESULTS: The mean MPXI in megaloblastics and aplastic anemia was 18.3 and 1.8 (p< 0.001) respectively. MPXI> 20 denoted megaloblastic and MPXI <-11.6 denoted aplastic anemia. CONCLUSION: MPXI measurement may assist differentiation of megaloblastic from aplastic anemia, while MPXI> 20 rules out aplastic and MPXI <-11.6 rules out megaloblastic anemia.
