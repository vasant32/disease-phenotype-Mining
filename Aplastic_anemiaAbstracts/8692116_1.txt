 PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1986 until August 1995 230 adult patients received an allogeneic or autologous transplantation of bone marrow or hematopoietic blood stem cells. The conditioning and myeloablative treatment regimens were chosen according to the underlying disease and type of transplant. RESULTS: The observation period comprises 1 to 115 months after transplantation. After allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical family donors, the probabilities of disease-free survival were for acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission (CR) (n = 35) 77%, for acute lymphoid leukemia in 1st CR (n = 7) 72% and in 2nd CR (n = 10) 40%, in first chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 34) 50% and in severe aplastic anemia (n = 7) 100%. Following myeloablative therapy and autologous transplantation the probabilities of disease-free survival were 47% in relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 22) and 42% for relapsed high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 12). Eight of 10 patients with acute myeloid and 7 of 8 with acute lymphoid leukemia suffered a leukemic relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Three of 8 patients with relapsed testicular cancer survived relapse-free. Treatment failures were due to more advanced acute graft versus host disease after allogeneic transplantation and caused by relapse after autologous transplantation. Current protocols evaluate the allogeneic transplantation of enriched CD34+ blood stem cells. In chronic myeloid leukemia the autologous transplantation of blood stem cells after myeloablative therapy is being studied.
