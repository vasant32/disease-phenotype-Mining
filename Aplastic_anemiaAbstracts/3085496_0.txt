Transfusion of blood products may be followed by viral hepatitis and aplastic anemia despite improved techniques for prevention. In view of the need for intensive therapy of hemophilia with blood products, the authors investigated the capacity of these concentrates to influence cultures of human bone marrow cells. Factor VIII concentrates contained a heat-stable dialyzable substance(s) that drastically impaired 59Fe incorporation in normal human bone marrow. Factor IX concentrates had less and cryoprecipitate had no such inhibitory activity. These studies may offer information regarding the effects of various blood products on bone marrow function.
