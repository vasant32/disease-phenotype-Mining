Two patients with severe aplastic anemia received combination therapy consisting of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) by subcutaneous injection. During the first 8 weeks, we administered only G-CSF, but subsequently we administered EPO with G-CSF. Administration of G-CSF caused rapid increase in neutrophil counts in each case. In the first case, a 23-year-old woman, the first sign of improvement of anemia appeared in the 12th week but 50 more weeks elapsed before improvement of platelet count. In the second case, a 59-year-old woman, marked increase of reticulocytes appeared in the 32nd week, and the RBC count become normal in the 46th week. Minor improvement of platelet count was obtained in the 40th week. After 53 weeks of treatment, we stopped administration of G-CSF and EPO, and all of peripheral blood cell counts decreased. Therefore G-CSF and EPO were given to her again, and she showed the same response as first administration. It showed that she was dependent upon G-CSF and EPO. Finally she obtained normalization of all blood cell counts. In both cases, no serious side effects were observed. Combination therapy consisting of G-CSF and EPO may be beneficial for patients with aplastic anemia.
