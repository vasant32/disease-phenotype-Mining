 PURPOSE: Secure venous access with multiple lumens is necessary for the care of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The outcomes associated with simultaneous bilateral tunneled internal jugular infusion catheter placement in the HSCT recipient population were investigated in an attempt to determine whether simultaneous introduction of these catheters compounds or magnifies the risks (infection, venous thrombosis) associated with tunneled catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing HSCT and receiving bilateral tunneled infusion catheters in a single procedure were identified using a quality assurance data base. Medical records for the duration of catheterization were reviewed; 43 patients were included in the study (mean age, 42 years; range, 22-56). Diagnoses included acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 8), aplastic anemia (n = 2), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 17), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1), myelodysplasia (n = 4), myelofibrosis (n = 2), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine differences in infection rates between dual- and triple-lumen catheters. RESULTS: Forty-three pairs of catheters were placed. All met venous access needs for HSCT recipient care. Complete follow-up was achieved for 77 of 87 (89%) catheters. The overall infection rate was 0.25 per 100 catheter-days. The rate was 0.19 and 0.33 for dual- and triple-lumen catheters, respectively (P =.15). Mechanical failure did not differ between catheter types (dual: 0.14 episodes per 100 days, triple: 0.05 per 100 days, P =.2). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multilumen tunneled infusion catheter placement in a single procedure using imaging guidance is safe with acceptable outcomes and meets venous access needs for HSCT. There is a trend toward higher infection rates, with more lumens and more mechanical failure with dual-lumen catheters.
