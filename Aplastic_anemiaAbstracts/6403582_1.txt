Three children, two with aplastic anemia and one with chronic granulomatous disease of childhood, were evaluated for hepatic abscess with hepatic scintigraphy (HS), gray-scale sonography (GSS), 67Ga imaging (GA), and computed tomography (CT). Each of the children was found to harbor two abscesses. All were detected with GSS and CT. In the two children imaged with GA, all four abscesses were seen. In two patients imaged twice with HS, 50% of the lesions were missed.
