The case of a 34 years old white female patient with severe bone marrow aplasia is reported. Treated with blood product transfusions, she developed cutaneous lesions consistent with graft versus host reaction. Skin biopsy revealed "satellite-cell" necrosis. The patient condition did not improve with high dose steroid therapy, and a fatal outcome was observed.
