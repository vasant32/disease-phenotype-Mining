This article describes the periodontal management of a patient with severe aplastic anemia. A 51-year-old female patient was hospitalized with aplastic anemia and was referred for the management of her cyclosporine-induced gingival enlargement and bleeding from her gums. She also complained of pain in the palatal area and the mandibular anterior region. The patient was managed successfully with supra- and subgingival instrumentation, local drug delivery (LDD), electrosurgery, repeated oral hygiene instruction, and constant supervision. The treatment resulted in dramatic improvement in the patient's oral health and quality of life. This report highlights the importance of nonsurgical therapy followed by electrosurgery for the management of residual gingival enlargement.
