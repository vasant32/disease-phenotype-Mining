Cyclosporin A (CsA) is used to prevent rejection in transplantation and to treat autoimmune and hematologic diseases such as aplastic anemia. However, the tumor growth-promoting effect of CsA remains controversial. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia of precursor-T-cell origin after 75 months of treatment with CsA for aplastic anemia. The surface antigen phenotype of his leukemic cells was CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, CD4-, CD8-, CD10-, CD20-, CD34-, CD41-, and CD56-. Southern blot analysis revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor-Jgamma nongermline fragments in HindIII digestion.
