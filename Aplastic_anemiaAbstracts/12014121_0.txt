In this series of 65 cases of aplastic anemia, 26 cases were treated by the kidney-tonifying and mediating method, 19 cases by western drugs, and the remaining 20 cases only by tonifying the kidney as controls. The results showed that the kidney-tonifying and mediating method was significantly superior in the total effective rate to the method of western drugs and that of tonifying the kidney alone (P < 0.01), and it was also superior in the improvement of symptoms, myelogram, and peripheral blood count to the other two methods.
