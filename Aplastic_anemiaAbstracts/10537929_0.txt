The International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry reported experience from 179 transplant teams worldwide on patients treated with bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. The cohort consisted of 470 patients (283 male, 187 female), mean age 20 years, who received an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant for aplastic anemia between 1988 and 1992. The etiology of aplastic anemia was usually idiopathic, with a small number of cases caused by hepatitis or toxin exposure. Congenital aplastic anemia was not considered. Expected mortality was based on the United States 1992 Total Population Mortality Table. Additional data were obtained from the author.
