Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and reactivation is an increasing complication in immune deficient patients, particularly after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is associated with higher incidence of EBV-related disease in HSCT patients, but this risk is not documented in patients receiving ATG for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). We describe the case of a patient who developed an EBV infection, with the clinical features of an infectious mononucleosis, after immune suppression with cyclosporine and two courses of ATG for SAA.
