Hyperferritinemia in various diseases, mainly hematological, was confirmed by immunological methods. For ferritin detection, anti-human placental ferritin antiserum, anti-human hepatic ferritin antiserum, and anti-human leukemia cell ferritin antiserum were used and the result was compared with each other. Leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia are hematological diseases which showed a positive reaction in this test, among which leukemia showed the highest positivity. Cases of hepatic diseases and non-hematological malignant neoplasms also showed a positive reaction. The positivity was quite low and almost negligible in other diseases and healthy individuals. Anti-human placental ferritin antiserum seemed to be suitable for cancer diagnosis and, antihuman hepatic ferritin antiserum for hepatic diseases. The results of analysis of purified human hepatic and placental ferritins highly suggested the presence of immunological heterogeneities between them. Also, a possibility was pointed out that one of the components of the so-called leukemia-specific antigens might sometimes be the isoferritin of leukemia cells.
