In a group of 44 patients with primary and secondary aplastic anemia, four (9%) developed an acute leukemia. Cytological changes that pointed to a preleukemia were not observed during the preleukemic stage. The possibility is discussed whether a aplastic anemia and a preleukemia can be distinguished by cytological, cytochemical and cytogenetic tests, by agar-culture technique, liquid-culture and determination of reverse transcriptase.
