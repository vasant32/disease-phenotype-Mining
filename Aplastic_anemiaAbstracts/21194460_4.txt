 BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). However, graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are major causes of the early morbidity in Allo-HSCT. METHODS: To reduce graft failure and GVHD, we treated fifteen patients with SAA using high- dose of HSCT with both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs from HLA-identical siblings to treat patients with SAA. RESULTS: All patients had successful bone marrow engraftment. Only one patient had late rejection. Median time to ANC greater than 0.5 × 10(9)/L and platelet counts greater than 20 × 10(9)/L was 12 and 16.5 days, respectively. No acute GVHD was observed. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 6.67%. The total three-year probability of disease-free survival was 79.8%. CONCLUSION: HSCT with both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs is a promising approach for heavily transfused and/or allo-immunized patients with SAA.
