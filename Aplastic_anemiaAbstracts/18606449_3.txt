Patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are at increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), possibly related to cell cycle dysregulation. In a cross-sectional analysis of bone marrow from 77 IBMFS, 71 sporadic conditions (AML, MDS, acquired aplastic anemia) and 22 normal controls we found overexpression of p53 in IBMFS, AML, and MDS; of Ki-67 in IBMFS and AML; and of survivin in IBMFS compared with all other groups. The patterns of expression of cell cycle markers in IBMFS are thus distinct. Longitudinal studies will determine the diagnostic and prognostic significance of these findings.
