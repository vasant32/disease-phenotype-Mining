A framework for the classification of continuous replicator (CR) pathologies expressed by cell kinetic changes, is presented. Each CR (e.g. GI mucosa or epidermis) is characterized by an origin, a periphery and a trajectory (called tissue radius) along which cells are displaced. The state of a cell on the radius is defined by two coordinates. Its distance from tissue origin 'x' expressed in cell locations, and its cruising velocity v(x), proportional to the cell production among cells separating it from origin. S(x) = x integral of o v(t)dt, represents further the net cell production associated with cell displacement from origin up to location x. The cell is regarded as a point advancing in a rectlinear motion defined by two coordinates (x,S(x)), tracing an S(x) graph outlining the proliferation differentiation states of a CR system. The S(x) graph is treated as a geometrical figure and the comparison of different CR pathologies reduces to the formulation of congruence laws. Three CR pathological entities are outlined: 1) Hemolytic pathologies e.g. hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, celiac disease and cervical erosion. 2) Hyperplastic pathologies e.g. polycythemia, papilloma and adenomatous polyp and 3) Hypoplastic pathologies e.g. aplastic anemia, skin and endometrial atrophy. Each pathology is marked by a typical S(x) graph.
