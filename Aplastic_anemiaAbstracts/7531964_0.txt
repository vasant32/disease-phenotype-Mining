The basic characteristics of granulo-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are reviewed. The structure of the proteins and genes have been clarified. The clinical use of these hematopoietic growth factors are also discussed. Diseases for which these growth factors will be effective are follows, the granulocytepenic state after anti-cancer chemotherapy, aplastic anemia, bone marrow transplantation and so on. As these growth factors increase the granulocyte function, these proteins will be effective on the immunodifective state.
