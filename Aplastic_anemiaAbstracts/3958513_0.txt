We performed hemopoietic colony culture assays in 15 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) in order to test the effect of hydrocortisone (HC) on late erythroid colony (CFU-e) formation of the patients' marrow and to correlate the in vitro culture results with the clinical response to corticosteroid therapy. HC enhanced CFU-e growth in four patients. All four patients failed to respond to corticosteroid, but three improved with with androgens. The addition of HC did not increase CFU-e colony formation in 11 patients. However, two of them responded to corticosteroid therapy. Among the nine patients showing no HC effect in vitro, two subsequently improved with androgens and one each with anti-thymocyte globulin and anti-lymphocyte globulin. The results suggest that the in vitro corticosteroid effect may not necessarily correlate with responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy.
