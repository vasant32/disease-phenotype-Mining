Seventy-one patients with severe infections associated with hematologic disorders including leukemia, lymphoma and aplastic anemia were treated with ceftizoxime (CZX) in daily doses of 4-6 g for an average of 20.1 days. Infections associated with hematologic disorders consisted of sepsis and pneumonia, and most of the causative organisms appeared to be Gram-negative bacteria. Of the 64 patients who completed the trial, excellent response was observed in 16 and moderate response in 26. The rate of clinical effectiveness was 65.6%. Side effects observed during the treatment included skin rash in only 1 patient, and hepatic disorders in 6 patients. However, the relationship between CZX and these abnormal findings was not established. These results indicate that CZX is a therapeutically effective and safe antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections associated with hematologic disorders.
