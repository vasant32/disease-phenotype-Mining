PURPOSE: We have evaluated irradiation doses received at location of secondary solid tumors occurring after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in five of 147 patients grafted for severe aplastic anaemia. RESULTS: All 5 tumors occurred within the radiation field penumbra. The estimated received dose varied from 6 Gy for one inner field secondary tumor, to 2.5 Gy for the remaining secondary tumors. CONCLUSION: Tumors may arise in the zone where the delivered radiation dose drops dramatically. Irradiation, with associated cofactors, may promote the development of epidermoid carcinoma in irradiated patients for BMT.
