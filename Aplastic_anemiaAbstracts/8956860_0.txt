We describe a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia with a novel isochromosome 18, i(18)(p10), preceded by aplastic anemia for six months. The patient is a cotton grower chronically exposed to pesticides. The significance of this chromosomal abnormality is unknown. The possible relationship to the preceding history of aplastic anemia and occupational pesticide exposure is speculated on. The possible mechanism of the association of acute leukemia and aplastic anemia is discussed.
