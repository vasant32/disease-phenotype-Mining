Therefore, in the tentative diagnosis "severe aplastic anaemia" an immediate transfer into a haematologic centre for the purpose of aseptic care, further diagnostics and therapy is indicated. On the basis of a short review of the level of the modern possibilities of therapy further recommendations relevant to practice are derived.
