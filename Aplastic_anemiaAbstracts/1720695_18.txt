We used X-chromosome methylation patterns to study clonality in aplastic anemia (AA) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). AA is usually not considered to be a clonal stem cell disorder, although this has not been directly investigated. PNH is generally assumed to be a clonal disorder, although there is contradictory evidence. Methylation analysis was performed on DNA from separated granulocytes and mononuclear cells, using the M27 beta and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) probes. Six of seven AA patients showed a polyclonal pattern of X inactivation. In contrast, five of five PNH patients showed a monoclonal pattern. These results imply that at least 80% of the cell population derives from a single stem cell. Because this high proportion of PNH cells might be considered surprising, three patients were studied for membrane expression of decay accelerating factor (DAF). In support of the DNA data, more than 95% of the granulocytes were DAF--ve in all three cases. We conclude that AA is predominantly a polyclonal disorder, whereas PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder. Our data support a model in which a single PNH stem cell has a growth advantage over other remaining stem cells and eventually dominates hematopoiesis.
