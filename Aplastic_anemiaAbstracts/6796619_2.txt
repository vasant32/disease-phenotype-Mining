Gastrointestinal Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GI GVHD) may occur following bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of acute leukemia or aplastic anemia. The resulting GI damage leads to symptoms including altered intestinal mobility, malabsorption, and protein losing enteropathy. A five-phase nutritinal regimen has been developed to supply adequate nutrient support, promote intestinal healing, reduce GI symptoms, and satisfy individual dietary preferences. The patient and family are integrally involved in the dietary planning and care. Dietary compliance is promoted through the use of nutrition education materials which explain GI GVHD and provide nutritional guidelines and their rationale.
