A 64 year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue. She noticed polyarthralgia 8 months prior to the admission and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was made. Administration of salazosulfapyridine (1.0 g/day) was started 6 months before the admission. Complete remission of rheumatoid arthritis was obtained in 2 months and blood cell counts showed normal values at that time. The results of laboratory tests included hemoglobin; 8.6 g/dl, white blood cell count; 1,900/mm3 with a differential of 19% neutrophils, 77% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes; platelets were 21,000/mm3. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. There were reduced numbers of myelocytes, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes indicating aplastic anemia. Salazosulfapyridine was discontinued. Prednisolone, anabolic steroid and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were administrated. In spite of these therapy, recovery of peripheral blood cell counts have not been observed and supporting therapy including red cell and platelets transfusion have been continued. To our knowledge, this is the first case report which describes occurrence of aplastic anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated by salazosulfapyridine.
