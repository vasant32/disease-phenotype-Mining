We describe a patient who had lipothymoma with red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and lichen planus. Parathymic syndromes described in association with lipothymomas also include myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, lymphangioma, aplastic anemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease. The behavior of lipothymoma is generally benign, although local recurrence was noted in 1 patient who had an incomplete resection. Lipothymoma should be considered in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors and parathymic syndromes, and also in patients with cardiomegaly, phrenic nerve palsy, and a widened mediastinum.
