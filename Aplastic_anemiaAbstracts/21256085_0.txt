We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment with fully matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants for children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in the first prospective trial in China. Six SAA children received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation combined with chemotherapy. Five patients had successful engraftment while the sixth child regained normal peripheral blood counts consistent with spontaneous autologous hematopoiesis. Mean duration of follow-up was 2.75 years, and survival was 83%(5/6). The results indicated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a good option for the treatment of children with severe aplastic anemia.
