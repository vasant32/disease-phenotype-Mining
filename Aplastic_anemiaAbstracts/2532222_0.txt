A case of lichenoid drug eruption due to nandrolone furylpropionate (Demelon) is reported. A 71-year-old man with aplastic anemia developed widespread erythema and reticulation with violaceous papules and pigmentation after receiving intramuscular injections of Demelon weekly for 2 months. The eruption gradually resolved after drug withdrawal, leaving reticular pigmentation. A biopsy specimen of the skin lesion showed lichenoid-type reactions including hydropic or colloid degeneration of the basal cells, sometimes with satellite necrosis, and a band-like subepidermal lymphocytic infiltrate. Most of the mononuclear cells stained strongly for helper/inducer T lymphocytes (Leu 3a).
