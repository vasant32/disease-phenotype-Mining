OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmaceutical effect of Spatholobus Suberectus Composita (SEC) on bone marrow hematopoiesis and microenvironment of aplastic anemia. METHODS: One hundred and six cases of aplastic anemia patients were treated by SEC and the pathological change of bone marrow were observed before and after treatment for 24 months, and compared with 17 cases of normal volunteers as control. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 77.4%. The degree of marrow hyperplasia (15.7 +/- 10.2 vol% vs 39.2 +/- 13.9 vol%), the percentage of the granulocytes (31.4 +/- 12.4% vs 39.9 +/- 10.4%), the erythroblastes (19.8 +/- 15.9% vs 36.7 +/- 13.5%), megakaryocytes (1.4 +/- 2.3 cell/section vs 24.0 +/- 24.6 cells/section), and the microvessel number (40.0 +/- 23.4 ves/100 mm2 vs 201.0 +/- 141.0 ves/100 mm2) ascended significantly (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SEC could not only irritate the hematopoiesis, but also exert reconstructive action to marrow microenvironment.
