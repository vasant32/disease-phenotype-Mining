Deferasirox is a once-daily oral iron chelator with established dose-dependent efficacy in both adult and pediatric patients with transfusional iron overload. The clinical development program has demonstrated the efficacy of deferasirox for up to 4.5 years of treatment in patients with various underlying anemias, including beta-thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, and other rare anemias. In addition to reducing key indicators of total body iron levels (serum ferritin, liver iron concentration, and toxic labile plasma iron), deferasirox has also demonstrated the ability to remove cardiac iron and prevent future cardiac iron accumulation. Emerging long-term data confirm the tolerability profile of deferasirox, and data on patient compliance render deferasirox a suitable therapeutic option for patients with chronic conditions requiring ongoing iron chelation therapy. Data continue to accumulate in a wide range of patient groups, including those with non-transfusion-dependent anemias such as hereditary hemochromatosis.
