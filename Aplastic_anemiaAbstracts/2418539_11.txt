The effects of benzene and its metabolites, hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone (PBQ) on RNA synthesis in mouse spleen lymphocytes in vitro were studied. Benzene and the quinones were shown to inhibit RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations which had no significant effect on lymphocyte viability. Furthermore, 5 microM PBQ, the putative toxic metabolite of benzene, was shown to inhibit the formation of the T-cell growth factor IL-2. These results suggest that inhibition of RNA synthesis in lymphocytes by benzene may prevent the production of factors required for hemopoiesis and thus contribute to the aplastic anemia caused by benzene.
