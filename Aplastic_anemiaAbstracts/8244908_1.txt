Because GM-CSF possesses burst-promoting activity (BPA) and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity (Meg-CSF) as well as stimulating activity on granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and erythropoietin (Epo) has thrombopoietin-like activity, the combination therapy of GM-CSF and Epo seems to be more effective for stimulating erythropoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis in patients with pancytopenia. For this reason, the combination therapy of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) and rhEpo was performed in two patients with refractory anemia (RA) and aplastic anemia (AA). Epo-unresponsive anemia was remarkably improved by adding rhGM-CSF to Epo and the effect lasted for 1 1/2 months in a patient with RA, but severe anemia occurred again immediately after the discontinuation of Epo. The neutralizing antibodies against GM-CSF were not demonstrated at the phase when anemia re-progressed in this patient. In a patient with AA, anemia and thrombocytopenia, which were refractory to previous administration of rhGM-CSF, responded to the combined administration of GM-CSF and Epo. Although the effects were maintained for 3 1/2 months, the anemia and thrombocytopenia became worse again after the administration of rhGM-CSF was changed from daily to every other day. These findings suggest the usefulness of combination therapy of GM-CSF and Epo for patients with pancytopenia.
