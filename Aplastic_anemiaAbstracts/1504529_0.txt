Aplastic anemia can be classified distinctively three types as progenitor depletive; immunosuppressive and androgenic sensitive. Using bone marrow culture in vitro which had been accomplished in our laboratory, 53 patients with aplastic anemia were also classified according to TCM term in three groups as Yin deficiency, Yang deficiency and both Yin and Yang deficiency, and the correlation was observed between TCM classification and lab character of these patients. The results showed that the number of CFU-GM, CFU-E and BFU-E in Yang deficiency group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05). It also showed that the sensitivity of progenitor cells to androgenic hormones of Yang deficiency group was preferential to all (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.05). The percentage of immunosuppressive type of aplastic anemia in Yin deficiency group was much higher than those in the other two groups (P less than 0.005). These observations suggested that TCM classification for aplastic anemia in this paper has objective material foundation.
