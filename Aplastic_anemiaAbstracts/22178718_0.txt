Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are generally caused by uncontrolled B-cell proliferation induced by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the setting of impaired EBV-specific T-cell immunity, particularly when there is pharmacological immunosuppression including antithymocyte globulin. We herein present an unusual case of EBV associated with LPD (EBV-LPD) in which LPD occurred 3 weeks after the use of rabbit antithymocyte globulin administered for severe hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia; the patient died of fulminant leukemic lymphoma 5 days after the onset. We also review the pertinent literature on EBV-LPD after immunosuppressive therapy and document the efficacy of EBV viral load monitoring and the need for preemptive therapy.
