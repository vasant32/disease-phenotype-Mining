Serum erythropoietin (EP) concentration was measured by the recombinant EP-based radioimmunoassay and was examined to standardize the hemoglobin (Hb) related level of 144 normal control and 56 patients with iron deficiency anemia and hemolytic anemia excluding paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The standardization was achieved by logarithmic regression of the EP titier on Hb either by the two-phase linear form or by the third degree sigmoid form at a 95% confidence limit for each regression. The third degree regression was found to be preferable from the view point of both statistics and the negative feedback mechanism. The average and scattering of the deviation from the standard level thus determined of the disease groups indicated that the EP level is: (1) 12 fold higher than the standard level in 42 aplastic anemias (the most in excess and a few in standard). (2) three fold higher than that in 27 myelodysplastic syndromes (relatively higher dispersed state). (3) 29% of the standard level in 33 anemias associated with chronic renal failure (deficient state). (4) 105% of the extrapolated standard level in 22 polycythemia veras (standard state). The standardization of Hb-related Ep titer may provide new pathophysiological approaches in a variety of hematopoietic disorders.
