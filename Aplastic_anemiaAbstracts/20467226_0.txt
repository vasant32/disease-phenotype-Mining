A 51-year-old woman developed very severe aplastic anemia complicated by chronic renal failure. She underwent ATG therapy, resulting in a transient effect. Thereafter, renal insufficiency progressed, followed by the induction of CAPD therapy. Although rabbit ATG (rATG) was administered as the next immunotherapy for aplastic anemia, pancytopenia persisted and she experienced repeated episodes of severe infection including MRSA and fungal infections. She was transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells from her HLA-haploidentical son after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen that included cyclophosphamide (three days of 30 mg/kg), fludarabine (two days of 20 mg/m(2)) and rATG (three days of 2.5 mg/kg). FK506 (0.03 mg/kg/24H) was administered for the prophylaxis of GVHD. Prompt trilineage engraftment occurred, resulting in the improvement of infections. Three months after grafting, she succumbed to cerebrovascular disease, although there was no apparent GVHD and she had remained well with stable hematopoiesis.
