Survival and quality of life are reported in 23 pretransfused patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The projected survival is 76% with 18 of 23 patients being alive 332 to 1677 days post graft (median: 842). 5 patients died between day 4 and 416. 12 of 17 patients at risk developed chronic graft versus host disease (GVH-D). 4 of these patients have a diminished quality of life due GVH-D related disabling manifestations. Autologous haemopoietic recovery was excluded in all patients by the demonstration of haemopoietic chimerism. We recommand age-adapted rejection prophylaxis; such strategy may help to diminish disabling graft versus host disease in otherwise haematologically reconstituted survivors.
