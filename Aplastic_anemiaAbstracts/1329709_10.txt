Highly virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was isolated from field cases, and the pathogenicity of the isolates was examined in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Chickens inoculated with the isolates developed severe clinical disease with a high mortality rate. Histopathologically, infectious bursal disease was characterized by bursal and thymic necrosis, aplastic anemia, acute hepatitis with fatty change, and systemic inflammatory response. In addition to functional abnormalities in the liver, a hypoxic state was induced by aplastic anemia and severe inflammation in the pulmonary air capillary walls. These pathological changes appeared to be closely related to the cause of death.
