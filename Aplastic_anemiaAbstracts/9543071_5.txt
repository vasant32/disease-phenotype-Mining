We describe a patient with severe Shulman's syndrome (ShS) (eosinophilic fasciitis). This auto-immune disease involved not only the skin and muscles, but the bone marrow as well - thereby fulfilling the criteria of severe aplastic anemia. As the disease was steroid-resistant, the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Remission of ShS was achieved. Eight months later chronic GVHD developed and relapse of ShS (probably induced by GVHD) occurred. He was successfully treated with corticosteroids and the disappearance of GVHD was followed by cessation of the symptoms of ShS. At present (34 months following BMT) he is doing well and displays no signs of ShS or GVHD. This case suggests that an aggressive immunoablative preparative regimen with subsequent allogeneic BMT can result in long-lasting clinical remission of a severe auto-immune disease.
