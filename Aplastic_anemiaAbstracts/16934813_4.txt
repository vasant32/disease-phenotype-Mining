OBJECTIVE: To examine maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia treated with supportive care. METHODS: From January 1995 to December 2004, 14 women newly diagnosed as having pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia were recruited for the study. RESULTS: Diagnosis was made during the second or third trimester for 11 (78%) of the 14 patients, and 3 of the 8 severe cases of aplastic anemia were diagnosed at initial presentation. All patients had conservative management with transfusions but no specific immunologic or hormonal therapy during pregnancy. Of the 12 women eligible for follow-up, 1 achieved complete remission and 8 achieved partial remission after delivery. The pregnancies progressed uneventfully in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes with transfusion support alone for pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia.
