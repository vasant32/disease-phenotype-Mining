Various polycyclic aromatic compounds induce certain monooxygenase activities, including aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase (EC 1.14.14.2), and cytochrome P1-450 in the liver and many nonhepatic tissues of the mouse. This induction process is controlled by the Ah locus. Genetic differences that have been shown in the past to be associated with the Ah locus include an increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis, mutagenicity in vitro, and drug toxicity--manifested as hepatic necrosis, aplastic anemia, or shortened survival time. Pregnant mice received a single injection of 3-methylcholanthrene or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene between day 5 and day 13 of gestation, and the uterine contents were examined on day 18. Striking increases were observed in the incidence of MC-1 and DMBA-induced resorptions and congenital malformations in the aromatic hydrocarbon "responsive" C57BL/6N inbred strain, and of DMBA-induced resorptions in the "responsive" C3H/HeN and BALB/cAnN strains--when compared with the similarly treated genetically "nonresponsive" AKR/N strain. These data suggest but do not prove that an association exists between the Ah locus and developmental toxicity, i.e., teratogenesis. Although numerous teratogenic differences among inbred mouse strains have previously reported, this study is unique in that the genetic differences in teratogenicity observed were predicted in advance on the basis of known differences among these strains in polycyclic hydrocarbon metabolism regulated by the Ah locus.
