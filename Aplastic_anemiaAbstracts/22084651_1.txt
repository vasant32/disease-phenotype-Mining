Infections are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in allogenic stem cell transplant recipients. Survival of the patient depends on the accurate diagnosis of the infectious agents and prompt and effective management of the infection alongwith maintenance of adequate immunosuppression post transplantation. We here reported a case of aplastic anemia who developed left upper lobe consolidation post allogenic stem cell transplantation and was found to have combined infection with tuberculosis and mucormycosis. This is the first case of combined infection with tuberculosis and mucormycosis reported in such a host, with a favourable outcome.
