A 20-year-old woman with aplastic anemia underwent bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling after total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and cyclophosphamide (CY). The post-transplant course was uneventful. CYA was discontinued on day 221. Three weeks later, the patient developed cutaneous GVHD precisely localized to the field of TLI. No other organs were involved. Immunohistochemical staining of the affected skin was strongly positive for ICAM-1, PECAM-1 and ELAM-1; normal skin was only weakly positive for ICAM-1. CYA was restarted, and the skin lesions disappeared. TLI may contribute to an unusual presentation of cutaneous GVHD associated with specific expression of adhesion molecules.
