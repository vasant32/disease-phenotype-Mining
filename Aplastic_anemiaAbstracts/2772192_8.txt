Thirty patients with various hematologic disorders and 15 healthy control subjects underwent quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the lumbar spine with spin-echo techniques. Images of patients with infiltrative bone marrow disorders showed significantly more prolonged T1 times than those of control subjects (P less than .001). It was not possible to distinguish different diffuse infiltrative bone marrow disorders on the basis of T1 values. Aplastic anemia could be distinguished from normality because of significantly shortened T1 (P less than .001). A significant correlation was seen between T1 and bone marrow cellularity (r = .74, P less than .001). T2 was of no value in the characterization of bone marrow disorders. Quantitative MR imaging dose not improve the diagnostic potential of bone marrow imaging in the detection of diffuse marrow infiltrates.
