By in situ hybridization with a c-fos probe, we have shown that human bone marrow megakaryocytes cultured in the presence of 20% aplastic anemia plasma constitutively express c-fos mRNA. At day 0, megakaryocytes are mostly immature and only 3% of them are labeled. The number of labeled cells reached 23% after 12 days of culture. Interleukin 3 (IL-3) and IL-6 added together at day 10 further increased this number to 31% 2 days later. Mature labeled megakaryocytes were more numerous and more strongly labeled than immature ones. These results suggest that c-fos could play a role in megakaryocytic terminal differentiation, either in the polyploidization or in the thrombopoietic function unique to these cells.
