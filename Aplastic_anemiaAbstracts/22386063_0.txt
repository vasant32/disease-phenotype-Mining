We described a 7-year-old girl with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage. She initially presented with high fever and pancytopenia, leading to a diagnosis of most severe type aplastic anemia. We treated her with cyclosporine, methylprednisolone and anti-thymocyte globulin. Thereafter she recurrently complained of a very severe headache called as thunderclap, and finally exhibited loss of consciousness. Brain imaging revealed massive parenchymal hemorrhage between the left occipital and parietal lobes on computed tomography, and diffuse cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiography. The cerebral vasoconstriction resolved within two months, and thus we diagnosed her as having reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage. This syndrome has been frequently reported in adult females, but rarely in children. However, even in children, a so called thunderclap headache may become a clue for the diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, especially in cases taking immunosuppressive agents. Immediate magnetic resonance angiography is essential to diagnose this syndrome, and a prompt application of calcium channel inhibitors should be considered to resolve constriction of the vessels and to prevent subsequent brain damage.
