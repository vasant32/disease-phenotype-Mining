This study was aimed to detect the ratio of CD34+ cells in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) and the expression rate of G(M)-CSFR on CD34+ cells in bone marrow of the patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The ratio of CD34+ cells in BMMNCs and the expression rate of G(M)-CSFR on cells of 27 AA patients, 45 MDS patients and 20 controls were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed that the ratio of CD34+ cells in BMMNCs of AA patients reduced and was significantly different from controls (p<0.05), the ratio of CD34+ cells in MDS patients elevated and was significantly different from controls (p<0.05). Compared with controls and MDS-RA patients, the ratio of CD34+ cells in MDS-RAEB patients significantly elevated (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between MDS-RA patients and controls (p>0.05). The ratio of CD34+ cells in MDS-RA patients was significantly higher than that in AA patients (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in expression rate of G-CSFR on CD34+ cells between AA patients and controls, MDS patients and controls, AA patients and MDS patients, MDS-RA patients and MDS-RAEB patients (p>0.05). The expression rate of GM-CSFR in MDS patients was significantly higher than that in AA patients and controls (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between AA patients and controls, MDS-RA patients and MDS-RAEB patients (p>0.05). In AA patients, the ratio of CD34+ cells in BMMNCs was less than 0.1% accounts for 6/8 SAA patients, compared with 2/19 in CAA (p<0.05). There was no correlation between the expression rate of either G-CSFR or GM-CSFR and neutrophil count at diagnosis (r=0.058 and r=0.044). In MDS patients, there was no correlation between bone marrow CD34+ cells ratio and peripheral neutrophil count at diagnosis (r=-0.335). And there was no correlation between the expression of either G-CSFR or GM-CSFR and neutrophil count on diagnosis (r=0.064 and r=0.051). It is concluded the detection of CD34+ cells and their surface expression rate of G(M)-CSFR in AA and MDS is useful in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of these two diseases.
