 OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effects of Busui Shengxue Granule (BSSXG) on chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) patients and its effects on bone marrow derived stroma cells (BMDSCs) correlated cytokines. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with CAA were randomly assigned to two groups according to the random digit table. Patients in the test group (61 cases) were treated with BSSXG, while those in the control group (63 cases) were treated with Zaizao Shengxue Tablet (ZST). The therapeutic course was 6 months for all. Besides, 10 healthy subjects were recruited as the normal control group. Changes of the symptom integral, therapeutic efficacy judgment, and changes of peripheral hemogram of patients were observed. The mRNA expression of b-fibroblast growth factors (bFGF) and b-fibroblast growth factors receptor (bFGFR) were detected by reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: The total effective rate of the test group was 75.0% (45/61), higher than that of the control group (58.7%, 37/63). Its symptom integral and peripheral hemogram were obviously improved, better than those of the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The mRNA expressions of bFGF and bFGFR of the test group were obviously lower than those of the normal control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). They were somewhat improved after treatment in the two groups, with better results obtained in the test group. CONCLUSIONS: BSSXG showed better clinical effects. It could improve the symptom integral and peripheral hemogram of CAA patients, improve the clinical efficacy, and regulate the expression levels of bFGF and bFGFR. It improved the hematopoietic microenvironment and promoted the hematopoiesis of the bone marrow through regulating the proliferation and oriental differentiation of stroma cells, and promoting the bone marrow angiogenesis.
