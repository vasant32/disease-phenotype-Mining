The clinical and microbiological features of 7 cases of bacteremia due to Capnocytophaga (Capnocytophaga ochracea group) are reported. They were diagnosed during 1991-93 at three hospital clinics. Five patients were < 10 years old and all had hematological disorders, 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1 each had aplastic anemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. All were profoundly granulocytopenic with an absolute granulocyte count < 0.13 x 10(9)/l, and all but 1 had oral lesions as a possible portal of entry. A favourable response to antibiotic therapy was recorded in all patients but one who, being profoundly granulocytopenic, rapidly succumbed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia. None of the isolates were beta-lactamase producers. In addition to penicillin the isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin, but resistant to aminoglycosides.
