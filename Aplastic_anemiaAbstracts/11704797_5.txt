A 21-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) from an HLA-matched and ABO-matched sibling donor after conditioning with cyclophosphamide, rabbit ATG (Lymphoglobuline; Aventis-Pharma), and total lymphoid irradiation. She had a long history of cyclosporin A (CsA) therapy before conditioning. She complained of severe headache and convulsions on day 0, and findings on magnetic resonance images suggested CsA-induced encephalopathy. CsA was immediately stopped, and tacrolimus for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was started on day 2. Hematological engraftment was observed on day 14 without serious GVHD. Prompt diagnosis, replacement of immunosuppressive agents, and careful monitoring of serum drug concentrations are thought to have contributed to the patient's good clinical course, since CsA-induced encephalopathy tends to be recurrent but to improve completely without any sequelae.
