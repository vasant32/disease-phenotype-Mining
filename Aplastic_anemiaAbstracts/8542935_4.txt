The newly described monoclonal antibody By114 has been used with flow cytometry to investigate the status of the 90-kD glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored component of CD66 (CD66c) on neutrophils from nine patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), seven with aplastic anemia/PNH, and 63 with aplastic anemia (AA) and a negative Ham's test. We have found that By114 is a sensitive indicator for recognizing patients with PNH and has helped delineate a group of nine patients with aplastic anemia and a negative Ham's test who have evidence of a larger PNH clone than indicated by other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). By114 is a valuable marker for detecting the emergence of a PNH clone before the Ham's test becomes positive and is a more sensitive detector of deficient GPI-anchored proteins than other mAbs.
