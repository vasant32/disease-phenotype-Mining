Anemia is common with connective tissue disorders, but pancytopenia is rare. We report a 22-year-old female who presented with menorrhagia, seizures, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, pericardial effusion, positive ANA, and evidence of vasculitis on CT head scan and was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). After 7 months of remission, she was readmitted with menorrhagia and pancytopenia. Investigations revealed aplastic anemia. She survived on transfusion support for 6 weeks, during which period she received methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulses, and phenytoin was omitted but to no avail. Cyclosporine (300 mg/day) was started and the aplastic anemia responded. After 4 months of therapy, the cyclosporine was gradually tapered over the next 2 months. The patient has been on 10 mg/day of prednisolone for the last 6 months. Aplastic anemia is rare in SLE and the response to immunosuppressants is variable, but here is a success story.
