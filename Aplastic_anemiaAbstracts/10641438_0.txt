We report on a female patient with acquired aplastic anemia whose bone marrow cells showed DNA rearrangement of the immunoglobulin-JH region that disappeared after 1 month with recovery of hematopoiesis through treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and immunosuppressive drugs. The patient is now 2 years and 6 months from onset, and her hematopoiesis is almost within normal limits without medication. This finding provides new data supporting clonal hematopoiesis in acquired aplastic anemia but does not imply that the disease is resistant to immunosuppressive therapy.
