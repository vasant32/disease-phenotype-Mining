Twenty patients with aplastic anemia underwent long-term administration (10 weeks) of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in doses from 50 to 800 micrograms/m2 per day by intravenous infusion or 50 to 100 micrograms/m2 per day by subcutaneous injection and re-combinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in doses ranging from 2000 to 8000 IU/m2 per day by intravenous injection three times a week for at least 4 weeks. The goal was to evaluate whether therapy ameliorated pancytopenia in these patients as well as to determine its safety. All assessable patients showed a substantial increase in absolute neutrophil count, with a recovery of myeloid components (granulocyte series) in the bone marrow, after 2 to 10 weeks of treatment. An increase > 1.5 g/dL in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was observed in 2 patients (10%). A decrease > 50% in red cell transfusion requirement was observed in 2 patients (10%). Seven patients showed recovery of neutropenia, anemia, and platelet count. In addition, there was no serious infection before or during therapy, and side effects were mild. Of the 20 patients, 3 showed a dramatic improvement in severe anemia after 10 weeks of treatment accompanying a recovery of erythroid components in the bone marrow. They no longer require red cell transfusions and have had normal Hb concentrations and normal ferrokinetics. These results indicate that long-term administration of rhG-CSF and rhEPO may benefit some patients with aplastic anemia. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which rhGCSF and rhEPO stimulate hematopoiesis and improve hematologic abnormalities in these patients.
