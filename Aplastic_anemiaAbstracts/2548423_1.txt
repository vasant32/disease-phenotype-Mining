The effects of canine parvovirus (CPV) infection in dogs with hemolytic anemia was compared with the clinical effects of human parvovirus-induced aplastic anemia in human beings with chronic regenerative anemias. Phenylhydrazine was used to induce a transient, severe, hemolytic anemia in dogs to evaluate the effects of CPV infection on rapidly dividing bone marrow precursors. Erythrocyte colony-forming unit bone marrow cultures and cytologic examination of bone marrow were used to determine the effects of CPV infection on erythroid bone marrow precursors. The induced hemolytic anemia regenerated rapidly and although the bone marrow was infected, it was determined that CPV infection did not induce a detectable decrease in erythroid progenitors in dogs with severe hemolytic anemia.
