Secondary malignancies after marrow transplantation have been observed in 20 patients: 19 patients underwent marrow transplantation for the treatment of a hemopoietic malignancy and one for aplastic anemia. All but three were given total body irradiation at doses of 8.0-15.75 Gy as part of the conditioning regimen. Secondary malignancies were composed of three groups: (a) Six patients had recurrence of leukemia (three acute lymphoblastic, two acute myeloblastic, and one chronic myelocytic) in cells of donor origin 62-1074 days after grafting. (b) Eight patients developed lymphoproliferative disorders (four of immunoblastic sarcoma type, one lymphoblastic, one follicular center cell, and one Hodgkin's lymphoma and one acute lymphoblastic leukemia) 54-730 days after grafting. In four of seven patients with appropriate studies these tumors were of donor-cell origin and in three of four tested the cells contained Epstein-Barr virus genome or expressed viral antigens. (c) Six patients developed solid tumors (two glioblastoma multiforme, two adenocarcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one sarcoma) 347-1875 days after grafting. All but two patients (one with glioblastoma and one with squamous cell carcinoma) have died. These data suggest that patients undergoing marrow transplantation for a hemopoietic malignancy may be at risk of developing secondary malignancies. The etiology appears to be multifactorial, including irradiation, immunosuppression, Epstein-Barr virus infections, and other factors.
