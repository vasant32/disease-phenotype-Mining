Hematological disorders like Aplastic anemia are quite frequent in Pakistan. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, have been implicated in the development of Aplastic anemia in various population-based studies, The aim of this study was to determine the role of the HLA Class I and Class II alleles in genetic susceptibility to Aplastic anemia in Pakistani patients. HLA A*, B* and DRB1* alleles were analyzed, in 61 Pakistani patients (Females n = 22, Males n = 39) and the control group consisted of 200 ethnically matched individuals (Females n = 89, Males n = 111). The allele frequency of DRB1*15 was found significantly higher in patients 0.36 (p = 0.001 with odds ratio = 1.97), as compared to the controls 0.212. Although DRB1*03 percent frequency was significantly higher in controls 0.175 (p = 0.023) with odds ratio = 0.514, as compared to patients 0.106.Therefore DRB1*15 emerged as a susceptible allele and DRB1*03 as a protective allele in Pakistani Aplastic anemia patients and control samples. No significant difference was found in allele frequencies of other HLA class I and HLA class II alleles for both patients and controls. Three haplotypes A*02 B*40 DRB1*15 (p = 0.021), A*31 B*51 DRB1*13 (p = 0.12) and A*33 B*58 DRB1*15 (p = 0.000) showed significant variations in the two groups.
