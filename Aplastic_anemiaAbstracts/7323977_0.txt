Coefficient of variation (C.V.) of red cell volume is inversely proportional to red cell mass in hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias. Even a subject with markedly reduced red cell survival and abnormal hemoglobin had a normal C.V. associated with normal hemoglobin level. In contrast are patients with nutritional deficiency, who have increased C.V. whether or not there is anemia, and patients with hypoplastic anemia, who have normal to near-normal C.V. independent of anemia.
