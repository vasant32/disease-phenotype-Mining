 INTRODUCTION: 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) has been widely used as an explosive. TNT can induce some well-recognized toxic impacts comprising toxic hepatitis, aplastic anemia and cataract. The aim of study was evaluation of TNT exposed workers for systemic complication. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we carried out Liver Function Test (LFT), complete blood count (CBC) and slit lamp biomicroscopy to compare the prevalence and severity of these 3 complications between 47 male TNT exposed workers (with at least one year continuous experience of TNT exposure) and 43 unexposed male hospital worker who hadn't had any previous contacts with TNT. We also performed Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) to assess the probable obstructive/restrictive abnormalities, caused by TNT. RESULTS: Mean alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of TNT exposed group was significantly higher than the unexposed group (p = 0.023) Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratios of both groups were in the range of restrictive pattern (82.03% and 81.42% for the exposed and unexposed group, respectively) with no meaningful difference. We didn't find out any specific TNT induced cataract and general cortical cataract (CC) and nuclear sclerotic cataract (NSC) prevalence was not significantly different. DISCUSSION: we haven't found TNT as a chemical, causing toxic hepatitis or aplastic anemia; neither did we find it as a compound, responsible for a meaningful increase in cataract prevalence. However, due to the increased ALP serum levels and FEV1/FVC ratios among TNT workers, safety precautions are advised.
