An 83-year-old man developed nonfatal aplastic anemia after taking methazolamide for three months. We made a diagnosis of methazolamide-induced aplastic anemia, discontinued all medication, gave the patient platelet and red blood cell transfusions, and treated him with oxymetholone. Approximately four months after initiation of treatment, the patient felt well, and he is currently receiving packed red blood cell transfusions every three weeks.
