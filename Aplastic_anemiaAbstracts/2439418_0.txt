In a survey different methods of culture are represented for the purpose of identifying and quantifying haemopoietic stem cells (CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, CFU-E/BFU-E) in human bone-marrow or peripheral blood respectively. On the basis of findings from international medical literature their validity is explained in the diagnostics and prognosis of some haematological diseases, such as acute and chronic myeloic leukemia, aplastic anemia, preleukemia. Special attention is given to their significance within bone-marrow transplantation. Their importance in evaluating transplantations after their preceding in-vitro manipulation as to the separation of rest tumour and T-cells is particularly referred to.
