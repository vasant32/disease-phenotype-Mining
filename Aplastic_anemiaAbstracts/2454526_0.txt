After an accidental or intentional ingestion of lindane, clinical manifestations of poisoning may include rapid onset of nausea and vomiting, coma, seizures, respiratory failure, and death. While rhabdomyolysis, secondary renal failure, and aplastic anemia have also been reported, coagulopathies have not been observed following poisoning with this pesticide. In this case report we describe a 43-year-old female who intentionally ingested 8 oz of a 20% lindane solution. Her serum lindane concentration reached 1.3 mcg/ml and her clinical manifestations included seizures, coma, rhabdomyolysis, secondary renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The coagulopathy presented early in her clinical course and resolved when serum lindane levels fell. The patient died 11 days after the ingestion.
