From January 1991 to March 2007, 61 children and adolescent with acquired severe aplastic anemia received BMT in our institutions. We retrospectively compared the outcome of 30 cases of matched-sibling donor BMT (MSD-BMT) and 31 cases of unrelated donor BMT (URD-BMT). We observed one graft failure among MSD-BMT recipients and three graft failures among URD-BMT recipients, respectively. No patients in the MSD-BMT group developed grades II-IV acute GVHD compared with 11 of 30 patients (37%) in the URD-BMT group (P<0.001). One of 30 MSD-BMT recipients (3%) developed chronic GVHD compared with 8 of 30 URD-BMT recipients (27%) (P=0.013). The incidence of EBV and CMV reactivation was 11 of 20 URD-BMT recipients and 23 of 30, respectively. One patient in the URD-BMT group died of a motor accident 5.5 years after BMT. Ten-year OS was 100% in MSD-BMT recipients and 93.8% (95% CI, 81.9-100%) in URD-BMT recipients, respectively (P=0.252). Ten-year failure-free survival was 96.7% (95% CI, 90.2-100%) in the MSD-BMT group and 84.7% (95% CI, 70.2-99.2%) in the URD-BMT group, respectively (P=0.161).
