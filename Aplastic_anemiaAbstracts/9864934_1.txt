Circulating thrombopoietin and interleukin-6 concentrations were investigated in two different settings of thrombocytopenia. Twenty patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP), 12 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and 15 healthy subjects were studied. Thrombopoietin was significantly increased in AA and deficient in ATP. Interleukin-6 was significantly increased in ATP, compared to both other groups.
