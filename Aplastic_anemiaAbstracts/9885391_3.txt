Acute onset of transient myopia may be induced by several drugs, different mechanisms having been described. We report the occurrence of such an event after intravenous administration of equine antilymphocyte globulins in a patient treated for aplastic anemia. Clinical ocular examination revealed no other abnormality, and ultrasonography disclosed no swelling of the ciliary body. The drug-induced myopia resolved completely after instillation of topical cyclopentolate, suggesting that its mechanism was the occurrence of a ciliary spasm. Acute myopia is a rare event and, to the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case described as being induced by antilymphocyte globulins.
