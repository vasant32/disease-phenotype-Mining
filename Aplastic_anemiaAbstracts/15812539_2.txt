Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease with a major autoimmune pathogenetic component. CTLA4 is a T-lymphocyte surface molecule involved in the maintenance of immune tolerance. Some polymorphisms associated with a reduced expression of CTLA4, and thus presumably with increased tendency to autoimmunity, have been associated with various autoimmune diseases. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of the low expression polymorphisms -318C > T and 49A > G of CTLA4 in a population of 67 patients with acquired AA and in 100 normal controls. There was no difference in the distribution of the tested polymorphism between patients and controls and, within the patient group, between those who responded to immunosuppression vs those who did not respond. This study indicates that the polymorphisms -318C > T and 49A > G of CTLA4 do not affect the risk of developing AA and do not influence the response to immunosuppression.
