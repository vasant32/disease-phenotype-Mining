We describe veno-occlusive disease of the liver associated with humoral and cellular immune defects in two siblings. Another child, with aplastic anemia, died before the age of 1 year. No consanguinity was found in the family. Both infants had lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia; the surviving infant has defective in vitro immunoglobulin production after stimulation of lymphocytes with pokeweed mitogen, increased proportions of OKT8 positive cells, defective proliferative responses to phytomitogens, and decreased help for immunoglobulin production. A therapeutic trial with cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, has not changed the immunologic status of the surviving child.
