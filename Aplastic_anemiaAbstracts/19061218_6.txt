About 10-15% of patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) have resistant/recurrent disease not eligible for standard treatment like hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and/or combined immunosuppression. We report a 17-year-old male with an 11 years history of AAA who, after two courses of immunosuppression, was red cell transfusion-dependent, severely thrombocytopenic, refractory to platelet transfusion, had iron overload and post-transfusion HCV infection. This patient achieved transfusion independence from platelets and normalized Hb after treatment with the anti-TNF agent Etanercept. Over a 12 months follow-up he experienced only transient increase of liver transaminases.
