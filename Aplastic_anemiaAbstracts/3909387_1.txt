5 patients underwent bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia (2) and acute leukemia (ALL) in first remission (3). Graft versus host disease prophylaxis was performed by depleting T lymphocytes in the donor bone marrow with the rat monoclonal Campath-1 and autologous complement. In addition, patients received cyclosporin A. Engraftment occurred normally in all 5 patients but 1 patient (SAA) had a late graft failure. Two patients suffered mild degrees of GvHD. All patients are currently in complete remission, one having undergone a second transplantation.
