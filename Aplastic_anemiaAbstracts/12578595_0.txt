The purpose of this study was to designed to analyze and explore the diagnosis and treatment on a patient with beta-thalassemia major accompanied with intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade IV after allo-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). The conditioning regimen was consisted of busulfan (18 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg), thiotepa (6 mg/kg) and horse anti-thymocyte globulin (110 mg/kg). The nucleated cells (10.6 x 10(9)/kg) and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells (11.7 x 10(6)/kg) were infused. At +14 days PBSCT, ANC and WBC achieved 0.66 x 10(9)/L and 1.4 x 10(9)/L respectively. The engraftment was successful but the patient depended on transfusion. The range of blood WBC was from 1.4 x 10(9)/L to 2.4 x 10(9)/L. The myelogram showed aplastic anemia. Hematopoiesis was restored continually after the second transfusion of the donor's cells. At +11 days the patient was suffered from cutaneous aGVHD grade II. Diarrhea occurred at +33 day when cutaneous aGVHD had been improved, and exaggerated obviously after the second transfusion at +39 days. The serious diarrhea continued for 2 months and intestinal aGVHD grade IV was finally diagnosed. Our conclusion was that intestinal aGVHD possibly occurred even when cutaneous aGVHD was improved. For a patient with refractory diarrhea after allo-PBSCT, intestinal aGVHD was considered first when the engraftment evidence was definited but peripheral blood cells and bone marrow were abnormal.
