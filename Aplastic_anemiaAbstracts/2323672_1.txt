Forty-three patients with hematopoietic disease were treated with intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from 28 HLA-identical and 10 one to two antigen haploidentical sibling donors and autologous BMT (5 cases). Of these cases, there were 21 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 5 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), 2 with Hodgkin's disease (HD), 8 with severe-form aplastic anemia (SAA) and 1 with thalassemia. Complications of BMT were evaluated including acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), interstitial pneumonia (IP), veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD), abnormalities of liver function (LF), and alteration of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers. In thirty-three patients who were followed up for more than 3 months, we found that the incidence of moderate to severe acute GVHD (9.1%) and IP (two cases, 4.7%) were low. No VOD occurred in our series. During the follow-up period, 27 out of 35 patients (77%) had high alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, even up to 1000 U/liter; however, only one patient succumbed to a hepatitis-related complication. Previous hepatic damage from HBV infection before BMT does not appear to increase the risk of posttransplant morbidity and mortality.
