A patient with aplastic anemia, who had been unresponsive to androgens, antithymocyte globulin, high-dose methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine, responded to treatment with 3-beta-etiocholanolone, nandrolone decanoate, and prednisolone acetate. Six months following initiation of therapy, she became red cell and platelet transfusion independent with neutrophils persistently over 1,000/microliters. A sustained partial remission has persisted for over 2 years. This observation suggests that a combined hematostimulatory approach may be of benefit, even in patients with long-standing refractory aplasia.
