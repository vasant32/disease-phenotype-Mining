One hundred eighty-seven women between 13 and 49 years of age had ovarian function evaluated from 1 to 15 years (median, 4) after marrow transplant for aplastic anemia or leukemia. Among 43 women transplanted for aplastic anemia following 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY), all 27 less than 26 years of age, but only five of 16 greater than 26 years of age recovered normal ovarian function. Nine of the 43 have had 12 pregnancies, resulting in eight live births, and two elective and two spontaneous abortions. All eight children are normal. Nine of 144 women transplanted for leukemia following 120 mg/kg CY and 9.20 to 15.75 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) recovered ovarian function. Two of these nine have had three pregnancies, resulting in two spontaneous and one elective abortion. The probability of having ovarian failure was 0.35 by 7 years for patients receiving CY alone and was 1.00 at 1 year for patients receiving CY plus TBI (P less than .0001). By 7 years after transplant the probabilities of having normal ovarian function were 0.92 after CY alone and 0.24 after CY plus TBI (P less than .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that TBI was the only factor significantly influencing ovarian failure and that both TBI and greater patient age at transplant were significantly associated with a decreased probability of recovering normal ovarian function. These data demonstrate that after high-dose CY, recovery of ovarian function occurs in younger women and in a minority of older women, but after CY and TBI, recovery occurs in only a few younger women and none of the older women.
