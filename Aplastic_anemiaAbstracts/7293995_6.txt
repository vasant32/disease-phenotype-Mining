Seventeen patients aged 7 to 33 months, including a pair of identical twin girls, came to the Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, between January 1975 and December 1979 with transient normocytic anemia and reticulocytopenia. In 16 of the patients, bone marrow aspirates were obtained; 15 showed erythroblastopenia and one showed erythroid hyperplasia indicative of recovery. Except for a cluster of six cases occurring from July to October 1979, no seasonal variation was observed. Unlike patients with congenital hypoplastic anemia, all 17 patients were of normal stature. Other distinguishing features of transient erythroblastopenia of childhood included onset after early infancy, normocytosis, and rapid, spontaneous recovery.
