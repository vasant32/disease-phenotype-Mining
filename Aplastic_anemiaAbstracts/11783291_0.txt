OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of composite blood-activating decoction (CBAD) on expression of adherent molecule CD49 d and cyclin D2 in bone marrow hematopoietic cells in experimental immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA) mice. METHODS: After the model of AA was established, the animals were fed with 0.2 ml of 100% CBAD, twice a day for 12 days. Te CD49 d and cyclin D2 expression level of bone marrow hematopoietic cells in model mice were measured by flow cytometor analysis system at the 13th day of experiment. RESULTS: CD49 d expression level in CBAD group was significantly higher than that in the AA group (P < 0.05), and was similar to that in the normal group (P > 0.05). The expression of cyclin D2 in CBAD group was significantly higher than that in the AA group (P < 0.01), but the cell count of G0 + G1 phase was significantly lower in the CBAD group, as compared with the AA group, P < 0.01. CONCLUSION: CBAD can increase the expression of adherent molecule CD49 d and cyclin D2 in bone marrow hematopoietic cells, and promote the growth of hematopoietic cells.
