Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is typically associated with the inability of T lymphocytes to proliferate and produce lymphokines in response to Candida antigen. A 7-year-old girl with CMC developed severe aplastic anemia and, after conditioning with cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, underwent bone marrow transplantation from her HLA-identical sister. Engraftment was prompt and complete. The patient is surviving more than 3 years after transplantation with normal donor-derived hemopoiesis and immune function. Manifestations of CMC have resolved completely and she has not received antifungal therapy for more than 2 years.
