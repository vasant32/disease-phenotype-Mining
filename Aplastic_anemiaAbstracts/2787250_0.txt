Urinary extracts from patients with aplastic anemia are known to promote murine megakaryocytopoiesis. In this report, we show a simple method for the partial purification of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor from human urine. A four-step purification procedure, which included ethanol precipitation, CM Affi-Gel Blue chromatography, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography and high-resolution hydroxyapatite chromatography, resulted in an about 430- to 630-fold increase of specific activity. The final fractions were still contaminated with erythropoietin, but the contaminated content of erythropoietin was not enough to stimulate mouse megakaryocytopoiesis in our culture system. We also demonstrate that human urinary extracts stimulated human megakaryocyte colony formation.
