To determine how alterations of megakaryocyte proliferation will affect platelet production, we measured mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet volume heterogeneity, platelet count, and mean megakaryocyte ploidy in 42 patients. In normal subjects, mean platelet volume and megakaryocyte ploidy were related inversely but nonlinearly to platelet count, whereas mean platelet volume and platelet volume heterogeneity were related directly. In patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (low platelet count, MPV above normal, and increased megakaryocyte ploidy), and in those with reactive thrombocytosis (high platelet count, low MPV and megakaryocyte ploidy), the relation of MPV to megakaryocyte ploidy, platelet volume heterogeneity, and platelet count resembled or extended the relations found in normal subjects. By contrast, in patients with aplastic anemia or megaloblastic anemia, or in patients who were undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, heterogeneity was increased abnormally at any MPV, and both MPV and megakaryocyte ploidy were substantially lower, at any platelet volume, than in normals or the above other groups. The most common ploidy class was 8N in all patients, and the mean megakaryocyte ploidy correlated directly and linearly with mean platelet volume. The data show that bone marrow with megakaryocytes of higher ploidy produces platelets that are both larger and more heterogeneous.
