 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combination of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with cyclosporine (CsA) and methotrexate (MTX) on prophylaxes of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in HLA-matched allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with acute leukemia (n = 21) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 17) and severe aplastic anemia (n = 1) were treated with allo-PBSCT from HLA matched siblings (n = 36) or unrelated donors (n = 3). Twenty-six patients were in CsA + MTX group. CsA was given at a dosage of 2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) by continuous intravenous injection for 24 h, since on day(-1) and injection of CsA was changed to oral administration of CsA around day 18. CsA was tapered by 10% per week after day + 90. MTX was given at the dosage of 15 mg at day + 1, and 10 mg at day + 3, + 6 and + 11, respectively. Thirteen patients were included in MMF + CsA + MTX group with the same dosage of CsA and MTX as above but omitted at day + 11. MMF of 2 g/day was added orally from day + 1 to day + 28 post transplantation. RESULTS: All patients in both groups were successfully engrafted. The days of recovery of neutrophils and platelets were not significantly different between two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of acute GVHD in MMF + CsA + MTX group (7.6%) was significantly lower than that in CsA/MTX group (46.2%, P < 0.05). Incidence of grade II approximately IV GVHD in MMF group was 0 while that in control group was 23.0%. The incidence of severe mucositis was lower in MMF group (15.4%) than in the control group (30.8%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The regimen of MMF + CsA + MTX for prevention of acute GVHD in allo-PBSCT is more efficient than that of CsA + MTX, without adversely affecting the engraftment and relapse rate.
