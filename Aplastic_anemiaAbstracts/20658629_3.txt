Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by reticular skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, mucosal leukoplakia, short telomeres, and a predisposition to bone marrow failure and malignancy. Patients carrying mutations in TERT show a wide clinical spectrum of abnormalities, including classical DC, isolated bone marrow failure and lung fibrosis. Here, we report the clinical description and biological analysis of a patient with compound heterozygosity for two new missense mutations in TERT (V96L and V119L). Both mutations segregate with a short telomere phenotype, though only V96L segregates with clinical signs of DC.
