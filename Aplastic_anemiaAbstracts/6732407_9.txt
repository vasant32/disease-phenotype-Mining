Hematologic complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) usually involve peripheral destruction of blood elements. We report a case of SLE-associated aplastic anemia in which an IgG complement-dependent antibody, obtained from the patient's disease-phase serum but not remission-phase serum, suppressed growth of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells from bone marrow of normal donors in vitro. Therapy with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression resulted in lasting remission.
