This is a study of myelofibrosis concerning 2.786 bone marrow biopsies in malignant hemopathies, and cancers supposed to be metastatic. In a first group myelofibrosis is a permanent symptom and necessary for the diagnosis: agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, Waldenstr√∂m's disease, hairy-cell leukemia, marrow extension of Hodgkin's disease and metastatic cancers. In a second group of hemopathies, myelofibrosis varies in frequency. Myeloid leukemia: 33% - Polycythemia: 40% - Thrombocythemia: 27% - Lymphoid leukemia: 17% - Acute leukemia: 20% - Kahler's disease: 30% - Aplastic anemia: 5% - Reticulin myelofibrosis is said possibly regressive. Collagen myelofibrosis is permanent.
