This study was undertaken in order to estimate the incidence of leukemia among Koreans. Medical records were studied of patients with diagnoses of either ICD-9 038 (septicemia), or 204-208 (leukemias), or 284 (aplastic anemia), or 289 (other diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs) in the claims sent in by medical care institutions throughout the country to the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation (KMIC) during the period from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1987. These records were abstracted in order to identify and confirm new cases of leukemia among the beneficiaries of KMIC, which covers about 10% of the whole Korean population. Using these data from the KMIC, the incidence rates of leukemia among Koreans were estimated as of July 1st, 1986 to June 30, 1987. The crude incidence rate of all types of leukemia among Koreans is estimated to be 3.45 (95% CI; 0.77-9.55) and 2.29 (95% CI; 0.28-7.81) per 100,000 in males and females, respectively. The cumulative rate for the age span 0-64 is 0.25% in males and 0.18% in females, and for the age span 0-74, 0.35% in males and 0.23% in females. The adjusted rates for the standard world population are 3.90 and 2.48 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively. The relative frequencies by type are 51.5% for AML, 21.6% for ALL, 20.2% for CML, and only 1.5% for CLL. The incidence patterns of various types of leukemia, of which this is the first report in Korea, are analyzed and presented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
