Parvovirus B19 infection in the transplant patient is rarely reported, although cases have occurred in patients with bone marrow, liver, and renal transplants and in children undergoing heart transplantation. We present the first reported case of an orthotopic heart transplant recipient with aplastic crisis caused by parvovirus B19. The infection was diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy, confirmed by serologic studies and polymerase chain reaction, and successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.
