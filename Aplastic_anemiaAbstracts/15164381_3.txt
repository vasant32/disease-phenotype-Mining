Fanconi's anemia (FA) is rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, congenital anomalies, and cancer susceptibility. FA patients have deficiencies in DNA repair pathways that cause cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation and cross-link agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane (DEB). If these patients survive until early adulthood, they are at high risk for developing solid tumors, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, esophagus, and vulva. Treatment of these solid tumors with radiotherapy is complicated by the increased risk of normal tissue toxicity. Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy is a technique that uses CT images to more accurately target tumors and maximize the dose to the tumor volume while limiting the dose to normal tissue. This report describes application of 3D conformal radiotherapy techniques to the treatment of vulvar cancer in a patient with FA in an attempt to limit the normal tissue volume exposed to radiation.
