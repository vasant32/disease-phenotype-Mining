Severe aplastic anemia is a well-recognized complication of fulminant non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis requiring orthotopic liver transplantation. The first line of therapy for cure in the treatment of aplastic anemia is a histocompatible bone marrow transplant. Immunosuppressive therapy is also effective if a histocompatible donor is not available. We describe two children who developed severe aplastic anemia following orthotopic liver transplant who achieved bone marrow recovery with a single course of anti-thymocyte globulin, solumedrol, and adjustments to their immunosuppressive therapy for prevention of liver allograft rejection.
