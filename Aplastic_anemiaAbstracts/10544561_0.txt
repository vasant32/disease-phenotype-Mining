Analytical parameters of instrumental methods of the element analysis of biomedical objects are compared and the place occupied by x-ray fluorescent analysis (RFA) among them is demonstrated. The methods for preparing the specimens of liquid media of the organism and the RFA are simple, rapid, involve no disintegration of the sample, and allow measurements of elements at sigma 1 = 0.02 at concentrations of 12 micrograms/ml. The method is preferable and promising for some basic elements (P, S, Cl, K, Ca), which are difficult to measure by other methods. The levels of S, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu were measured in erythrocytic mass and blood serum of normal subjects, patients with asthma and aplastic anemia, and recipients of allogenic kidneys.
