Liver iron and copper concentrations were estimated in 395 patients undergoing hepatological examination. Relations to clinical, morphological and laboratory data were evaluated. Liver iron concentrations were not significantly different in chronic hepatitis of viral, toxic or immunological origin. Liver iron levels exceeding 100 mg/100 g dry liver tissue (normal range up to 300 mg/100 g) were only found in idiopathic hemochromatosis (n = 8), in a patient with prophyria cutanea tarda and in a multiple transfused patient who suffered from aplastic anemia. Liver copper content was significantly increased in primary biliary cirrhosis compared to chronic hepatitis of other origin. Apart from untreated Wilson's disease (n = 3) copper levels higher than 25 mg/100 g dry liver tissue (normal range up to 6 mg/100 g) were measured in chronic active hepatitis B (n = 2), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 9) and in chronic hepatitis of uncertain origin (n = 3). Therefore excess accumulation of copper in the liver was typical of Wilson's disease but less diagnostic than severely elevated liver iron stores of idiopathic hemochromatosis.
