Soft tissue infections were seen in 25 patients with underlying malignancy and immunosuppressive disease. The primary disease included leukemia, lupus, aplastic anemia, lymphoma, carcinoma and myeloma. Infectious sites included the perianal area, gluteal, chest wall, extremity and the vulva. Eighty per cent of the infectious episodes occurred in patients who were granulocytopenic. Initial presentation was of local tenderness and redness. Fluctuation and discoloration were present in nine patients who were also hypotensive. Local drainage in five patients resulted in the death of two (20%). Overall, the mortality was 3/25 (12%). Wide debridement and drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy resulted in the death of 1/20 (5%) patients. Hypotension, discoloration and fluctuation were found to be late signs in these patients. Soft tissue infections in the compromised host present subtly and progress to death if treatment is delayed. Temperature elevation and localized tenderness and erythema are indications for broad spectrum antibiotics and extensive intraoperative drainage and debridement.
