Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a standard therapeutic modality for a few autoimmune diseases, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura. However, in other hematologic autoimmune conditions its role is still controversial. Methods: Seven patients with either autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Evans' syndrome, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or acquired factor VIII inhibitors were treated with a single course of high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg. Results: A good response was observed in all seven patients, except the one with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and there were no adverse effects related to IVIg use. The literature reports on IVIg therapy in these conditions and the mechanisms of action of IVIg in autoimmune diseases are discussed. Conclusions: IVIg might be a useful agent in the treatment of several hematologic disorders other than immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Future aims of clinical research in this respect would be to identify the patient subgroups that might benefit more from IVIg in these conditions.
