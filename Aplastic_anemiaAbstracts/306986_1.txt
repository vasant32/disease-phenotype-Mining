A case of ectodermal dysplasia and aplastic anemia is presented in which a cell-mediated immunodeficiency led to a fatal Pneumocystis carinii infection. Elevated levels of IgG, IgA and IgD were present with normal specific antibody titres. A deficient cell-mediated immunity was documented by low T cell numbers, poor in vitro mitogenic responses, negative skin tests and by the histologic finding at autopsy of thymic dysplasia.
