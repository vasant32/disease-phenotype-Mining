A multiplicative model is described relating HLA typing information to disease incidence. A likelihood-based method for estimating parameters in this model is proposed for use with data sets in which HLA haplotype information is available on a series of cases and their parents. This approach is extended to incorporate information from a matched control series for the purpose of estimating HLA and environmental risk factor effects simultaneously. The method is applied to data from aplastic anemia patients treated by bone marrow transplantation and the results are compared to unmatched case-control analyses using the same case series and several different control series.
