All etiologies of acute viral hepatitis are associated with a transient suppression of hemopoiesis and, rarely, with the development of aplastic anemia. Both hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses directly inhibit the growth and differentiation of human bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro. We now report a similar effect of a non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis agent on human bone marrow progenitor cells. Three chimpanzees were inoculated with a putative NANB agent. Coded sera were blindly evaluated for their ability to affect human bone marrow colony formation in vitro. Sera obtained during the acute phase of NANB hepatitis inhibited the in vitro growth of human erythroid (CFU-E, BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells, compared with sera obtained before inoculation. Sera obtained after remission of both the biochemical and histological hepatitis and sera obtained from a chimpanzee who underwent biochemical but not histological remission did not inhibit the stem cell assays as much as the acute phase sera. These results suggest an approach to identifying the viremic phase of NANB hepatitis. Inhibition of human bone marrow proliferation appears to be a common property of all known hepatitis viruses.
