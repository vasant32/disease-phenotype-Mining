The diagnosis of transfusion-associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was made in 2 patients who developed delayed opportunistic infections and severe cytopenias--56 months for the former (patient 1) and 22 months for the latter, (patient 2) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for aplastic anemia. In the third case, grafting for acute leukemia (patient 3) (HIV) infection was probably responsible for the failure of hematological and immunological reconstitution 8 months after allogeneic BMT. Each patient received 6 lymphocyte transfusions from the marrow donor for 3 weeks, combined with a 3-month course of low-dose recombinant alpha interferon. This treatment was followed by recombinant gamma interferon for 3 months. We showed that these 3 patients could resume a normal life for 9 months, at least, and that hematological restoration was observed. Our treatment succeeded in correcting the defect of proliferative response to Candida and the impairment of gamma interferon generation for 4 months in one patient and for more than 12 months in the other two recipients. Nevertheless T4 lymphocyte levels increased only slightly and HIV can still be isolated from the patients' blood. At the time of writing, patients 1 and 3 remain in good health with a partial immunological restoration while patient 2 has died of neurological impairment 2 years after the AIDS diagnosis. Although we cannot generalize this successful therapeutic approach to all patients with AIDS, the results may provide an interesting model of the potential effect of lymphocyte transfusions and the role of interferon therapy.
