We report a fatal case of septicemia due to a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a 9 year old girl with aplastic anemia. The isolate was also resistant to ampicillin, teicoplanin, gentamicin (high level), and streptomycin (high level). We believe that this is the first case of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) reported from a clinical specimen in Brazil.
