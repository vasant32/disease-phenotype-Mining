AIM: To evaluate frequency and clinical features of CMV infection in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) after autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, protective and therapeutic methods, efficiency of CMV hyperimmune immunoglobulin cytotest (Biotest Pharma). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 22 patients (group 1) with HM and severe aplastic anemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, 58 patients (group 2) with HM after autologous stem cell transplantation. The patients were examined for CMV infection by serologic methods and PCR. RESULTS: The probabilities of CMV infection were greater in group 1 than group 2--10/22(45%) versus 12/58 (21%), p < 0.05. Clinical signs of CMV disease were pneumonitis (27%), hepatitis (32%), gastroenteritis (9%), haemorrhagic cystitis (55%), slow engraftment (59%), prolonged thrombocytopenia (68%), encephalitis (5%). Six (60%) patients with CMV infection after allogeneic and 1(8%) patient with CMV infections after autologous stem cell transplantation were dead. The cytotest after allogeneic transplantation of the bone marrow reduced the risk of CMV infection from 62 to 36%. CONCLUSION: CMV infection influences prognosis both in allogeneic and autologous transplantation of hemopoietic stem cells. Cytotest lowers the risk of CMV development after transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow.
