The content of 12 trace elements in the hair of 20 aplastic anemia patients was determined and compared with that of normal subjects as control. The results showed that patients with deficiency of yin had a significant decrease in lithium, calcium, strontium, and chromium, those with deficiency of yang had a distinct decrease in zinc magnesium barium, strontium, calcium, and lithium, and those with deficiency of both yin and yang had a general decrease in all the 12 trace elements. Changes in trace element content in hair may serve as a guide to opening up new vistas in the treatment of aplastic anemia on the basis of an overall analysis of symptoms and signs.
