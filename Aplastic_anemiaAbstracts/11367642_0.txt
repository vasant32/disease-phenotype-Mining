OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of ligustrazine on CD34 antigen expression of bone marrow cells in immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA) mice. METHODS: The model of immune aplastic anemia mice was induced by means of 6.0 Gy60Co gamma-ray irradiation and lymphocyte infusion through tail vein. The mice were divided into 3 groups: the normal group, the AA control group and the ligustrazine group. Mice of the ligustrazine group were fed by 4 mg of ligustrazine injection twice a day by gastrogavage. On the 10th day, CD34 antigen expression intensity of bone marrow cell membrane was measured by flow cytometer analysis system. RESULTS: CD34 antigen expression intensity of ligustrazine group was 77.6 +/- 6.5, with no statistic difference from that in the normal group (80.0 +/- 2.6), while that of the control group was much higher (68.6 +/- 4.5, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ligustrazine could promote proliferation of stem and progenitor cell of AA mice through influencing on bone marrow micro-environment so as to increase the CD34 antigen expression of bone marrow cells.
