Th activation of red cells is characterized by agglutination with the peanut lectin from Arachis hypogaea and is diminished by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. The first cases of Th activation were associated with bacterial infections. More recently, a high incidence of Th activation in congenital hypoplastic anemia has been reported, along with the finding that 13.5 percent of cord bloods are Th activated. The incidence of Th reactivity in newborn infants was confirmed by studying 200 paired samples of maternal and cord blood. Twenty-two (11%) of the cord samples and 13 (6.5%) of the maternal samples were Th activated. In 6 paired samples (6/22), both the mother and child had Th activation, a finding that demonstrates a high degree of concordance. Additionally, 3 (6%) of 50 pregnant women were Th positive. These findings indicate that Th activation is another of the red cell antigen alterations related to pregnancy.
