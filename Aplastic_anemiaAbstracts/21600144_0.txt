 OBJECTIVE: To survey the incidence of acquired adult aplastic anemia (AA) in Shanghai, China. Meanwhile, we compared it with the previous data from China in 1986 and other countries in order to explore the trends. METHODS: Newly diagnosed AA patients were registered in 6 districts (Jingan, Xuhui, Huangpu, Changning, Putuo, Yangpu) in Shanghai from 2004 to 2006. Then we calculated the crude and age-adjusted incidence of AA according to the population data from Shanghai Statistic Yearbook. RESULTS: There were 38 adult patients with acquired AA. The average crude incidence of AA was 0.33/100 000 from 2004 to 2006. The incidences per 100 000 persons per year were 0.40, 0.14 and 0.64 in 18 - 34, 35 - 59 and â‰¥ 60 years, respectively. The rate of severe AA was 0.17/100 000. CONCLUSION: The incidence of severe AA has no marked change, but the total rate is a little decreased compared with the data from China in 1986.
