Congestive cardiomyopathy and final stage of a liver cirrhosis due to massive overload of iron are often the cause of death in polytransfused patients with aplastic anaemia. With increasing frequency of transfusion the problem of overload of iron becomes more actual. The toxicity of abundant iron is based on various mechanisms of action, which are compiled with the help of literature. Our experiences hitherto made with the intravenous long-term infusion of desferrioxamine are reported. This regimen of therapy is not to be practiced in the long run.
