Human parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infections are usually asymptomatic or benign and self-limiting. In immunocompromised patients and patients with chronic hemolytic anemia, it can lead to transient red cell aplasia. Few reports in the literature have implicated HPV B19 as the possible cause of acute hepatitis and severe aplastic anemia in immunocompetent patients. Here, the authors report a previously healthy 6-year-old girl with acute hepatitis and severe aplastic anemia associated with HPV B19 infection diagnosed by serology (ELISA). Other common causes of these manifestations were ruled out. The clinical manifestations subsequently improved significantly with the use of immunosuppressive therapy confirming an autoimmune mechanism.
