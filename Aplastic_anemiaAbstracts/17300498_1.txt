We have employed the 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) containing conditioning regimen to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in pediatric patients irrespective of donor type since March 1986. The outcome of BMT for 17 SAA patients is favorable. Eight patients received BMT from human leukocyte antigen matched-related donors (MRD) and nine received BMT from alternative donors. The conditioning regimen consisted of 3-Gy TBI and cyclophosphamide of 200 mg/kg in the BMT from MRD. In the case of BMT from alternative donor, antithymocyte globulin 10 mg/kg was added to the regimen. Fifteen of 17 patients (88%) engrafted on median of day 18 (range, 11-26) and all 13 evaluable patients showed complete donor chimerism by median 30 (range, 13-47) days after BMT. Fourteen patients have survived with a median follow-up of 67 (range, 2-228) months and the probability of survival was 81.9% (95% CI, 63.3-100%). No late complications including second malignancies caused by TBI have been observed and all three female patients have regular menstruation. In conclusion, TBI of 3 Gy appears to be an appropriate dose regarding to ensure engraftment and avoid the risk of late adverse event for SAA patients.
