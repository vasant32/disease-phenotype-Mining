The level of erythropoietin (Ep) was measured in sera and urine from aplastic anemia patients. Increased levels of Ep were demonstrated in sera from all 25 patients studied. An elevated level of Ep was found in the urine of 17 of 23 patients in whom the urine was tested. No correlation between blood hemoglobin and Ep level was observed. A higher serum Ep level was noted in patients with aplastic anemia than in patients with sideropenic anemia of the same severity. To explain the discrepancy diminished Ep consumption in bone marrow of aplastic anemia patients is discussed.
