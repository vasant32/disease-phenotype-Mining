Comparative data on he postmortem morphological examination of the knee joint in children treated and not treated with ciprofloxacin while alive are presented. Nine children were ill with mucoviscidosis and 8 children were ill with aplastic anemia. The patients were ill with mucoviscidosis and 8 children were ill with aplastic anemia. The patients were treated with ciprofloxacin in a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg body weight at the average for 148 days. The condition of the articular cartilage, growth area, spongy bone and synovial membrane of the knee joint was examined visually, histologically and morphologically. It was revealed that ciprofloxacin had no chondrotoxic effect. The structure affected in some cases by the ciprofloxacin treatment was the synovial membrane which developed subacute synovitis not clinically manifested (latent) in life. The phenomenon is explained.
