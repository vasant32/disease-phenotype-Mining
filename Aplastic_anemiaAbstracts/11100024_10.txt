The use of ablative intravenous cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg per day for 4 days) without stem cell rescue has been described in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases such as paraneoplastic pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and aplastic anemia. We describe a 33-year-old patient with pemphigus vulgaris recalcitrant to multiple therapies. The patient presented with numerous oral ulcerations, erosions, and hyperpigmented crusted plaques on his face, trunk, and arms. Findings of a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence were consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. The circulating pemphigus vulgaris autoantibodies were present at a titer of 1:640. The patient received immunoablative therapy (50 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide for a total of 4 days) and tolerated the regimen well. Complications such as thrombocytopenia and Pseudomonas septicemia were quickly treated. Four months after the 4-day therapy, his oral and skin lesions completely healed, and his pemphigus titers have decreased to zero. He is no longer receiving prednisone and no new lesions have developed. This provides further evidence that this regimen is relatively safe and provides a potential "cure" for refractory autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris.
