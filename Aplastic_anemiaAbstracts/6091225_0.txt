CMV infection is one of the major infection after bone marrow transplantation. CMV viremia was systematically studied in 66 patients with aplastic anemia or leukemia undergoing BMT. 57% patients had CMV viremia with a frequency peak between 7 and 9 weeks after transplant. Clinical symptoms found during viremia were pancytopenia, fever, cytolytic hepatitis. Interstitial pneumonitis was found only in 4 cases. In 3 cases, viremia was not associated with clinical symptoms. Survival was identical to the group of patients without viremia. Viremia was positively associated with the presence of high anti-CMV antibody titer in donor or recipient before transplant, or to a lymphocyte proliferative response against CMV antigens in donor or recipient before BMT. Granulocyte transfusions increased the frequency of CMV viremia. CMV infection was significantly associated with acute and chronic graft versus host disease. The relation showed between these parameters and viremia provides a basis for an accurate diagnosis of CMV infection and a better background for the study of prophylactic or curative treatment of CMV infection.
