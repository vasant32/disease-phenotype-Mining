OBJECTIVE: To explore the effective method in treating infantile chronic aplastic anemia (ICAA) by using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). METHODS: Seventy-eight cases of ICAA were observed, 48 of them were treated with Tiaoxue Yisui recipe (treated group), 30 cases were treated with SSL regimen (control group). RESULTS: The remission rate and total effective rate in treated group were 52.08% and 81.25% respectively, they were higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). After one year treatment the ratio of hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells in treated group was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The number of megakaryocyte in treated group was more than those in control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Tiaoxue Yisui recipe could improve the quality of the patient's life. The therapeutical mechanism of the Tiaoxue Yisui recipe might promote the proliferation of hemopoietic stem cells and regulate the immune function.
