Patients with reduced ability to metabolize environmental carcinogens or toxins may be at risk of developing aplastic anemia. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) has been implicated in detoxifying mutagenic electrophilic compounds. This study asked whether the homozygous gene deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 affect the likelihood of developing aplastic anemia. The incidence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions was significantly higher for aplastic anemia patients (odds ratio [OR]: 3.1, P =.01 and OR: 3.1, P =.004, respectively) than for healthy controls. Among the aplastic anemia patients, 17.5% (10:57) had chromosomal abnormalities at the time of diagnosis, and all aplastic anemia patients with chromosomal abnormalities showed GSTT1 gene deletions (P =.048). Individuals with GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions may have greater susceptibility to aplastic anemia. It is possible that genetic instability or chromosomal damage due to abnormal detoxification of environmental toxins might have worked as an important pathophysiologic mechanism of aplastic anemia for patients with GSTT1 gene deletions.
