A severely alloimmunized boy with aplastic anemia received an HLA-identical BMT from his brother. Despite intensive immunosuppression and large marrow dose, peripheral signs of engraftment occurred only late under G-CSF treatment. With leukocyte counts of < 0.5 x 10(9)/l, chimerism could be proven not only by oligonucleotide fingerprinting but also within 48 h by analysis of polymorphism in the TCR gene family. This rapid and sensitive method to detect engraftment before it became quantitatively evident was important for the clinical management of the patient, obviating the need to search for an alternative marrow donor.
