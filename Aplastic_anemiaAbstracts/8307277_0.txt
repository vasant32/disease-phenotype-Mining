Histologic specimens of the bone marrow were obtained from healthy subjects and aplastic anemia (AA) ones. Comparison of the histomorphometry was indicative of an increase in spongy bone tissue and in the number of osteoid cells in AA. This indirectly suggested enhanced proliferative activity of osteogenic precursors and osteosynthesis in AA. Interrelationship is probable between osteogenesis and hemopoiesis.
