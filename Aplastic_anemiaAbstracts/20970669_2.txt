The pathologies of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are primarily caused by somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene in hematopoietic stem cells resulting in glycosyl phosphatidylinositol deficiency and accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in plasma membranes. The mechanism of pathologic clone domination over normal hematopoietic clones in PNH patients is not yet understood. Forty-four PNH patients, including 9 with aplastic anemia traits (AA/PNH), 31 without full aplasia in bone marrow (de novo PNH, or dn/PNH), and 4 with unclassified PNH, and 200 ethnically matched controls were tested for the HLA A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 alleles and haplotype associations. The top block association analysis showed the primary association of PNH with 3 haplotype fragments: the class I fragment A*2501-Cw*1203-B*1801 (risk ratio [RR], 6.64; P=.00012), and 2 class II fragments: DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (RR, 7.09; P=.0000015) and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0301 (RR, 6.76, P=.0093). The stratified analysis revealed that the A*2501-Cw*1203-B*1801 haplotype associated preferentially with AA/PNH, and its component HLA molecule showed immunodominant antiapoptotic peptides derived from PI-activated phospholipase D; whereas the DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype was associated strongly with dn/PNH and presented immunodominant class II-derived autopeptides. We concluded that certain HLA haplotypes were associated with PNH much more strongly than their allelic components. At least 3 HLA haplotype blocks (A*2501-Cw*1203-B*1801, DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602, and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0301) were primarily associated with PNH. Our results supported the hypothesis of the roles in AA/PNH of antiapoptotic and in dn/PNH of autoimmune mechanisms.
