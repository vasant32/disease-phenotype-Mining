We report the cases of two severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients who were successfully treated with syngeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) using immunosuppression without high-dose chemotherapy or irradiation for conditioning. A 21-year-old woman with SAA of 6 years duration had been transfused heavily before transplantation and had developed refractory thrombocytopenia, chronic hepatitis and secondary hematochromatosis. Syngeneic PBSCT with immunosuppression using ATG, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporin-A was eventually performed without high-dose chemotherapy in September 1997. The second syngeneic PBSCT with the same immunosuppression was successfully performed in a 35-year-old male patient who had had SAA for 3 months in November 1998. Haemopoietic engraftment was rapid and sustained. There was no infection or mucositis during the syngeneic PBSCT. The patients are currently 9 to 22 months post-PBSCT without rejection. Our experience suggests that syngeneic PBSCT with brief immunosuppression is an effective alternative to pretransplant high-dose chemotherapy conditioning for SAA patients having syngeneic transplantation.
