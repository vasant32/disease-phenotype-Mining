The measurement of erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) with a hematofluorometer is known to be a simple and cost-effective method to screen iron deficiency and lead poisoning. We measured ZPP on blood samples from 201 children suffering from various diseases, which revealed that ZPP has better sensitivity and specificity for identifying iron deficiency than serum ferritin and percent transferrin saturation. ZPP levels in various anemias were also measured. ZPP rose markedly (> 200 mumol/mol heme) in untreated iron deficiency anemia and returned to normal in 3-4 months since the initiation of iron therapy. Moderate elevation of ZPP was observed in acute leukemia (at onset and during induction therapy), MDS, aplastic anemia and some other anemic conditions. These findings suggest that erythrocyte ferrochelatase may be unexpectedly affected in anemias even except lead poisoning.
