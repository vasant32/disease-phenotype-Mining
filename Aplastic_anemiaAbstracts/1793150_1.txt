Growth of the patients with hematological malignancies, aplastic anemia, Fanconi's anemia, and Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome who had been treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was studied. Fourteen out of 21 patients showed suppression of linear growth after BMT. Recovery of the growth velocity after 1-2 years tended to occur if BMT was performed at younger age. Six of eight patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (CGVHD) had impaired growth after BMT, whereas eight of 13 (61%) without CGVHD did. Provocative tests for growth hormone (GH) performed 5-72 months after BMT revealed three boys who showed poor response to more than two different stimuli. Two of these three boys had prolonged suppression of growth. Neither the age at BMT, difference in disease, nor presence of posttransplant growth retardation gave significant difference in the response of GH to provocative tests. It was concluded that approximately two-thirds of marrow-grafted children experienced transient decrease in growth velocity after BMT.
