 BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has been associated with aplastic anemia, but a causal relationship has been questioned. CASE: A case of aplastic anemia was diagnosed during pregnancy and initially mimicked immune-mediated thrombocytopenic purpura. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with aplastic anemia are at high risk. The severity of the disease and choice of the patient have to be considered before treatment.
