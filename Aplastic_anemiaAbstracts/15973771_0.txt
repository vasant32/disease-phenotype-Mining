 OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic potential of Fas inhibition in different diseases, a Fas-targeting siRNA (small interfering)-expressing plasmid was constructed. METHODS: The U6 promoter cassette and siFas (small interfering RNA that inhibit Fas expression) template sequence were obtained by PCR method. They were cloned into modified pcDNA3.1. The resultant plasmid pU6-siFas was transfected into P815 cells with lipofectin2000 and selected under G-418-containing culture medium. Fas inhibition in stably transfected cells was detected by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The plasmid pU6-siFas efficiently reduced the expression of Fas and conferred G-418 resistance in P815 cells. CONCLUSION: The successful construction of the siRNA expressing plasmid will facilitate the application of RNA interference technique and lay the foundation for further study of Fas inhibition in the treatment of different diseases such as aplastic anemia and acute liver failure.
