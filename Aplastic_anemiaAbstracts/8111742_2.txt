Thirty-one patients (19 males and 12 females; mean age 23.9 years, range 4-41 years) were treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) after intensive chemoradiotherapy. Their diagnoses were as follows: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 13, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in seven, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in six, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in two, aplastic anemia (AA) in two, and Fanconi anemia (FA) in one. Allogeneic BMT was performed in 28 cases (17 donors were of like sex, 11 were of unlike sex), one patient received syngenic transplant, and one received transplant of cells obtained from an unrelated donor through a computerized international registry in London. Autologous BMT was performed in three patients. BM cells were analyzed cytogenetically at diagnosis, before and serially after BMT (three to nine times). Follow-up ranged from 2 to 55.5 months. Cytogenetic examination was a very useful method for monitoring posttransplantation course in patients with CML or in those who received BM cells of unlike sex. Results of concomitant cytogenetic examinations are reported in detail.
