 PURPOSE: Previous studies have evaluated practice variation in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) among transplant centers and countries. There are no studies investigating individual physician practice variation in HCT. METHODS: An international Internet-based survey of transplant physicians collected data on medical decisions made by adult and pediatric HCT physicians. Multivariable analyses identified practitioner and transplant center characteristics predictive of medical decision making. RESULTS: Analysis of 526 assessable respondents showed a wide variation in management approaches to specific clinical scenarios. Pediatric and adult transplant physicians differed significantly in their management strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and choice of graft source for patients with aplastic anemia. Among adult transplant physicians, there was little agreement on the patient factors favoring reduced intensity conditioning or myeloablative conditioning. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the heterogeneity of worldwide transplant practices. Local preferences or biases likely result in similar patients being offered different transplant and treatment procedures. The degree of practice variation also highlights the need for clinical trials to clarify areas of controversy. Where clinical trials are not feasible, data from observational studies may be the best available evidence to guide practice.
