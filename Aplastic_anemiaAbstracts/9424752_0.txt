Cell cycle stage distribution of bone marrow cells was studied at flow cytometry in 137 hematological patients. They had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, lymphosarcoma with leukemization, blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia (31, 34, 18, 12, 17, 8, 9, 8 cases, respectively). It was found that in leukemia, and to a lesser degree in anemia, stability of the cell cycle was impaired. In leukemia onset, recurrence and remission, the proportion S/(G2+M) appeared increased evidencing defective DNA synthesis by myelokaryocytes and ineffective hemopoiesis. Similar changes were seen in pernicious and aplastic anemia.
