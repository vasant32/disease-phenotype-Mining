We used preparative regimens consisting of cyclophosphamide and total lymphoid irradiation in 4 children with severe aplastic anemia undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. All 4 children engrafted successfully in spite of the number of donors exposed in the previous blood components transfusion. Three of 4 transplanted children have survived for 390 days, 540 days, and 1,235 days respectively. One child died of graft-versus-host disease related sepsis. The actual survival rate was 75% at one year. Further efforts must be aimed at the elimination of graft-versus-host disease and the control of fatal infections.
