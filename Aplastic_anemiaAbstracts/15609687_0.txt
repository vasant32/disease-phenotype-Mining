A 31-year-old woman was given a diagnosis of aplastic anemia (AA) in 2000 and was treated with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (horse serum), cyclosporine and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In 2002, she came to our hospital. The laboratory data revealed severe cytopenia according to the criteria by Camitta. A cytogenetic study revealed a normal female karyotype. We demonstrated CD55-negative and CD59-negative clones in her erythrocytes and granulocytes. HLA-DR 1501 was negative. After corticosteroid pulse therapy, the del(13q) (7/21 cells) was noted in her marrow cells. She was re-treated with ATG (rabbit serum), cyclosporine and G-CSF without particular cytogenetic changes after the therapy. Deletion of the 13q anomaly is rarely detected in patients with AA and its clinical significance in this disease is not well known. In the literature, AA patients with the del(13q) responded well to immunosuppressive therapy, irrespective of the timing of the appearance of the del(13q) anomaly. Further investigation will be needed to clarify the significance of del(13q) in AA.
