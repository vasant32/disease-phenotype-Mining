Two patients treated by unrelated bone marrow transplantation were reported. Case 1 was an eight-year-old boy with Morquio's disease received bone marrow graft from an HLA one-locus mismatched, MLC non reactive unrelated donor. The patient was prepared with conventional dose of cyclophosphamide, and thoracoabdominal irradiation. For the prophylaxis of GVHD, three drug regimen consisted of methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine A (CsA), and prednisolone (PSL) was administered. Engraftment was prompt, and grade I of acute GVHD developed, which resolved with increased dose of PSL. Case 2 was a ten-month-old boy with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia received bone marrow graft from an HLA fully matched, MLC non reactive unrelated donor. Preconditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation, VP-16, and cytosine arabinoside. MTX, CsA, and methylprednisolone were administered to prevent GVHD, but grade II of acute GVHD developed, which resolved with prolonged course of PSL. Both cases are alive and well, without chronic GVHD. In conclusion, unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation may be a useful to treat hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, and some inherited diseases.
