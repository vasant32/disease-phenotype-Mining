Fetal-like erythropoiesis frequently accompanies marrow stress conditions such as Diamond-Blackfan syndrome and aplastic anemia. In contrast, patients with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood have erythrocytes which lack fetal characteristics at the time of diagnosis. This report describes nine children with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood in whom transient, fetal-like erythropoiesis was observed during the period of recovery. These patients initially presented with anemia, reticulocytopenia, erythrocytes of normal size for age, low levels of fetal hemoglobin, and i-antigen. During the recovery period, however, erythrocytes manifested one or more fetal characteristics. These included an increased fetal hemoglobin (in three of five patients), the presence of i-antigen (in four of six patients), and macrocytosis (in seven of nine patients). These fetal characteristics persisted more than 2 wk after the reticulocyte count returned to normal. Within one year from diagnosis, red blood cells contained no fetal characteristics.
