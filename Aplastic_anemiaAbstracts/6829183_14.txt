Filtration through Imugard filters of random platelet concentrates or platelets obtained by plateletpheresis allow the preparation of leukocyte-free platelets for transfusion. The procedure is simple and determines only a small platelet loss (less than 10%). Filtered platelets seem to function normally in vivo. The use of leukocyte-free red cell and platelet transfusions for the support of patients suffering from leukemia or aplastic anemia could prevent major complications, such as refractoriness to platelet transfusion and to bone marrow transplantation.
