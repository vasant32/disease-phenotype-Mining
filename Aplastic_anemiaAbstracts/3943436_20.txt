Neutropenic enterocolitis, also known as typhlitis or ileocecal syndrome, is a recognized complication of the treatment of hematologic malignancies and usually is fatal. The pathologic findings consist of bowel-wall ulcerations and necrosis with bacterial or fungal invasion. These findings are usually limited to the ileum, cecum, ascending colon, and appendix. The syndrome occurs in a select patient population who generally have 1) a hematologic malignancy, 2) neutropenia, 3) thrombocytopenia, 4) a recent course of chemotherapy, and 5) a recent course of antibiotics. This syndrome also can arise spontaneously in patients with aplastic anemia or cyclic neutropenia. The clinical presentation consists of a high fever and right-sided abdominal pain with evidence of peritoneal irritation. Recommended therapy is right hemicolectomy.
