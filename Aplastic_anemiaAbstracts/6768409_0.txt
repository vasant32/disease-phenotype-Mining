Atypically light red cells were detected at the plasma--phycoll solution (with a specific gravity of 1.077) boundary in 24 out of 26 patients with paroxysmal nocturmal hemoglobinuria (PNH) by means of centrifugation of the patients' blood in 600 g density gradient for 30 minutes. Atypically light red cells have a decreased amount of Rh-antigen and the positive Coombs direct test after addition of anticomplement serum. As a result of splenectomy patients with autoimmune hemolytic and hypoplastic anemia showed the appearance of atypically light cells in the upper layer the first day after the operation. It is suggested that the presence of atypically light red cells is connected with the deficient immune system in patients with PNH, specifically with insufficiency of the spleen function to eliminate the defective red cells.
