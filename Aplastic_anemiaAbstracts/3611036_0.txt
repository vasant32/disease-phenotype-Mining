A case of carbamazepine-induced leukopenia with subsequent successful carbamazepine management is presented. Despite WBC suppression to a level of 2000/cu mm on an initial trial of carbamazepine, a challenge with a much lower dose and gradual titration permitted a full treatment course with therapeutic blood levels. Although many physicians are wary of the leukopenia associated with carbamazepine, it is a distinct entity from the rare agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia that have been associated with the drug. With careful clinical management, carbamazepine can be successfully used in patients with neurologic disorders despite significant WBC suppression.
