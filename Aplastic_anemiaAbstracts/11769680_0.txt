OBJECTIVE: To report a patients with acute aplastic anemia(AAA) successfully treated with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(allo-PBSCT). METHODS: A 30 years old patient with AA received allo-PBSCT from a HLA-compatible sibling donor. PBSCs mobilization regimen was G-GSF 250 micrograms/d x 6. The conditioning regimen included (CTX 50 mg.kg-1.d-1) x 4 and (ATG 10 kg-1.d-01) x 2. 8.97 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg, 9.20 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, 11.20 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg were transplanted. RESULTS: Hematopoietic reconstitution obtained on day 18 after allo-PBSCT. Monitoring of engraftment with three microsatellite markers showed mixed chimerism on day 18 and complete chimerism after day 25. No acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurred. In the follow-up duration of 240 days, the blood and bone marrow pictures were normal and the living status was good. CONCLUSION: Allo-PBSCT was an effective therapy in the treatment of acute aplastic anemia.
