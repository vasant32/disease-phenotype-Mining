Cytotoxic T-cell lines were generated following in vitro culture of lymphocytes from a patient suffering from aplastic anemia together with those of his HLA-identical brother, a repeated transfusion donor. The segregation pattern within the family of the determinant(s) detected by these cytotoxic cells strongly suggested that a minor alloantigen(s) was being detected. Testing of the effectors on a panel of unrelated individuals indicated that it was best seen in association with HLA-B7, which was common to both the patient and his sibling donor.
