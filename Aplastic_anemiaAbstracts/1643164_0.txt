We report a case of reversible bone marrow aplasia related to the use of naproxen. A 71-year-old women developed severe pancytopenia after she had been treated with naproxen for more than 8 weeks. Bone marrow examination showed marked hypocellularity compatible with aplastic anemia. Full recovery of the pancytopenia and bone marrow was observed when naproxen was discontinued. Absence of exposure to other drugs and lack of underlying disorders known to cause bone marrow aplasia makes this case unique.
