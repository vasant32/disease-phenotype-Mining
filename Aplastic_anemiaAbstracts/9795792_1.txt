The first reported case of Clostridium septicum myonecrosis in an adult with aplastic anemia is described. The patient presented with sepsis, a parapharyngeal abscess that necessitated emergent intubation, and severe intravascular hemolysis attributed to clostridial alpha-toxin production. Despite prompt recognition and treatment, the patient died of his infection. C. septicum myonecrosis should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with sepsis, especially when accompanied by evidence of multiple sites of tissue infection.
