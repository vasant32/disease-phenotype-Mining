A case of thymic carcinoma documented after a 6-year history of aplastic anemia is reported. The anemia responded initially to steroids and antithymocyte globulin. The carcinoma may have arisen in a previous undetected thymoma; alternatively, an underlying abnormality, presumably immunologic, played a role in the development of the anemia and the thymic carcinoma.
