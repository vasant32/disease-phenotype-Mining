Thirty-six patients with different types of bone marrow failure have been studied by double scintigraphy, with 99mTc-colloids and 111In.-transferrin. The observed results are compared to those obtained by bone marrow biopsy and ferro-kinetic studies. Despite our imperfect knowledge of the physiology of indium, and the non-selectivity of this tracer for the erythropoietic line, the good correlation observed in most cases between scintigraphy with 111In. and ferro-kinetics and bone marrow histology is an argument which favours the clinical use of this tracer. A striking difference between the results of scintigraphy with Tc-colloids and scintigraphy with 111In. was noticed in chronic erythroblastopenias, and in most of the aplastic anemias, primitive or due to partial leukemic involvement of the bone marrow. It is suggested that this double study may have an interest for the prognosis in these cases. In patients with lymphoma, treated by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, In. and Tc scintigraphies show an extension of active bone marrow to normally inactive zones. It indicates a severe defect of the normally active zones, and appears to be a contra-indication for any supplementary chemotherapy. In myeloid metaplasias, this study may be useful for the choice of treatment, by giving precise indications on the degree of splenic erythropoiesis and of bone marrow cellular depletion.
