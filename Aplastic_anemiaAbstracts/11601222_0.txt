OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of ligustrazine on the expression of adherent molecule of bone marrow cells in immune-mediated aplastic anemia(AA) mice. METHODS: Each immune-mediated AA mouse was intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg ligustrazine twice a day. On the 14th day, expressions of CD49d and CD49c in bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) were detected by flow cytometry, and VCAM-1 on stromal cells by immunohistochemistry SABC. RESULTS: Expressions of CD49d, CD49e and VCAM-1 were significantly lower in AA group than in normal group(t = 11.96, 17.18 and 7.09 respectively, P < 0.001), and were much higher in ligustrazine treated group than in non-treated group(t = 9.05, 14.61 and 6.91 respctively, P < 0.001). Expressions of CD49d and VCAM-1 were in the normal range in ligustrazine group. CONCLUSIONS: Ligustrazine can increase the expression of adherent molecule of bone marrow cells in immune-mediated AA mice, thus promote the growth of hematopoietic cells.
