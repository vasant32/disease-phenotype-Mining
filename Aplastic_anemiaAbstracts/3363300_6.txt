During the 20-year period 1967-1986, 5,500 children (aged 2 months-14 years) with viral hepatitis were hospitalized in a Thessaloniki pediatric department. In 4 children (0.07%) hepatitis was complicated with aplastic anemia. All 4 patients died. The mean duration of survival after the onset of aplastic anemia was 20.9 +/- 24.8 weeks. The results of the serologic tests, performed in the last 2 patients, suggest that aplastic anemia was associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis agents.
