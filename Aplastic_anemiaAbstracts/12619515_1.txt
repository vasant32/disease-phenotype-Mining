Results of prospective comparative investigation of monofluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin) arthropathy are presented. The trial was performed at 144 children with mucoviscidosis (aged 0.5-16) and at 37 children with aplastic anemia (aged 1.75-15). Two groups differ by necessary antibacterials regimes and hence by different abilities for arthropathy development: patients with mucoviscidosis were treated with fluoroquinolones followed by repeated short courses in combination with other antibacterials; patients with aplastic anemia--were treated permanently for a long time with low doses as monotherapy for autoinfection prophylaxis. Analysis was performed on the base of catamnesis, year growth rate, postmortal morphological investigation of the right knee joint. It was shown that quinolone arthropathy development didn't depend on treatment duration, as it developed during the first three weeks of the fluoroquinolone use, but depended on the drug, patient age and nosology. Arthropathy has favourable prognosis and was fully resolved at the period from 7 days to 3 month according to the arthropathy form (arthrologic, arthritic). Quinolones arthropathy at the children has specific features, the main one is absence of cartilage damage confirmed by morphological analysis.
