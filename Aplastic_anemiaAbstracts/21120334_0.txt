Dipyrone is an antipyretic and analgesic medicine very used by the Brazilian population. The administration is considered safe even in pregnant women, nurseling and children, but is forbidden in some countries, as supposedly causes agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. In 2001, National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) approved the commercialization of this medicine in Brazil. However, it does not matter the safeness in the use of a medicine advances, if it does not have quality. Based on this quality, this work was elaborated, that analyzes seven samples of commercialized different marks of dipyrone oral solution in pharmaceutical establishment in the Cascavel city, Paran√°, Brazil. The results demonstrate that the quality control of similar drugs must be improved as were the ones that presented quality deviations.
