Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been used in recent years for the treatment of immunodeficiency diseases, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. However, there are a number of serious problems and limitations associated with autologous or allogeneic BMT. One of these is an increase in opportunistic infections, of which cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most important. Cytomegalovirus has been associated with more frequent deaths than any other single agent, with no reproducibly successful or therapy currently available. Recently usage of interleukin-2 or immunomodulation has been suggested as a powerful modality to combat infectious disease. In this study we showed that bone marrow activated in interleukin-2 for 2 days has the ability to lyse spleen cells infected for 3 days with murine CMV (acute infection model) or salivary gland cells infected for 7 days (chronic infection model), while nonactivated bone marrow or natural killer (NK) cells showed no such lysis. The majority of activated cells involved in lysis were antiasialo GM1-, Thy-1+/-, indicating a population of cells other than the natural killer-cell population involved.
