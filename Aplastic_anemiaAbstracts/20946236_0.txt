Concomitant infections are frequent and usually the causes of death in patients with severe AA. HSCT can restore hematopoiesis in AA, but it is usually life threatening when patients simultaneously have an IFI. Mixed IFIs have been reported on rare occasions. The exact diagnosis of IFIs is difficult because of low fungus culture rate, difficultly obtaining tissue specimens in severely immunocompromised patients or those with bleeding tendencies. Otherwise, treatment with anti-fungal drugs alone for DMIFI was always lethal in previous reports. Surgical resection is crucial for invasive zygomycosis, but severe pancytopenia and bleeding tendency make therapy difficult. Herein, we report that with a combination of aggressive anti-fungal drugs, HSCT, and surgery, we successfully treated a 10-yr-old boy with severe AA and pulmonary zygomycosis before HSCT and disseminated mixed invasive zygomycosis and aspergillosis after HSCT.
