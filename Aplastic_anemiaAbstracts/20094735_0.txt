The patient, a 62-year-old male suffering from aplastic anemia for 6 years, was admitted in order to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. Results of laboratory tests at the time of admission revealed pancytopenia: white blood cell count, 1.94 x 10(3)/microl (neutrophil count, 1.23 x 10(3)/microl); red blood cell count, 2.09 x 10(6)/microl; Hb 7.5 g/dl; and platelet count, 3.7 x 10(4)/microl. The patient received supportive therapy prior to surgery, including blood transfusion of red blood cells, platelets and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). On the day of surgery, the white blood cell count increased to 3.93 x 10(3)/microl (neutrophil count, 2.75 x 10(3)/microl). Surgery ended with no intraoperative complications, but neutropenia progressed and persisted postoperatively: the neutrophil count decreased to 180/microl at its lowest and stayed at about 400-600/microl. This suggests the possibility that repeated preoperative administration of G-CSF may lead to the depletion of granulocyte precursor cells and thus cause harm. Although the patient fortunately achieved a favorable outcome without severe infection, this case is a stark reminder of the difficulties involved in perioperative supportive therapy for patients with chronic pancytopenia.
