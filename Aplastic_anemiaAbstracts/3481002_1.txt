Aseptic bone necrosis is a well known complication after corticosteroid treatment in adults and several hundred cases have been reported. Alterations in fat metabolism with vascular occlusion due to fat embolization, as well as microtraumata and osteoporosis are discussed as etiologic factors. In contrast, aseptic bone necrosis in relation to corticosteroid treatment is rare in children and adolescents. We therefore report 3 patients, aged from 10 to 18 years, suffering from severe aplastic anemia, meningeal relapse after acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia respectively, who developed aseptic bone necrosis 6, 11, and 20 months following the onset of corticoid therapy. The patients survive from 28+ to 50+ months after diagnosis of their initial hematologic disease, as it can be expected today for increasing numbers of patients. We therefore believe, that aseptic bone necrosis may represent a serious therapy related complication and suggest that, diagnostic examination in patients with suspicious complaints of the hip, shoulder or knee should also exclude the possibility of a bone necrosis after leucemic relapse has been ruled out. Since radiological changes only develop several weeks to months after the onset of the clinical symptoms and because of the disabling consequences for patients, misdiagnosed at the beginning, a 99 technetium bone scan should be done as early as possible. Corticosteroids, despite their serious side effects are still being considered as a important part of hematologic therapy and are not being omitted in the near future, so that the earliest possible diagnosis of bone necrosis will remain of great importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
