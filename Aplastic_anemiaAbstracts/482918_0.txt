The frequency of common HLA-A and -B antigens was determined in 30 couples with a child suffering from acute leukemia (AL), 34 couples with a child suffering from aplastic anemia (AA) and 58 random couples with healthy children. Increased frequency of couples sharing at least two common antigens was observed in parents of both AL and AA children.
