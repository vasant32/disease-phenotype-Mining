Erythrocyte basic ferritin (EF) concentration was determined in 64 normal subjects, 123 patients with anemia and 12 patients with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. There was a significant difference between males and females. Other iron indices, including plasma iron (PI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) and plasma ferritin (PF) were also determined in all the subjects and bone marrow iron stain was determined in the 135 patients. The lowest EF concentration was seen in patients with iron deficiency anemia, being significantly lower than that in normal subjects. EF concentration in patients with iron deficiency erythropoiesis was also lower than that in normal subjects and at the same time significantly different from that in patients with iron deficiency anemia. EF concentration increased prior to PF concentration in patients with iron deficiency anemia who had been treated for a period of 1-8 weeks. EF concentration in patients with anemia of chronic diseases had a significant difference as compared with that in normal subjects and in patients with iron deficiency anemia, but EF concentration in those patients who were accompanied by iron deficiency was similar to that in patients with simple iron deficiency anemia. EF concentration in some iron overloaded patients (aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, MDS etc.) was significantly higher than that in normal subjects. It was demonstrated that there was a good correlation between EF concentration and bone marrow sideroblastic iron in the rank correlation analysis of the iron indices in 135 patients (rs 0.893, P less than 0.01). PF concentration had the best correlation with marrow iron (rs 0.948, P less than 0.01).
