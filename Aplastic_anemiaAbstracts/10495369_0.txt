Aplastic anemia, defined by the presence of pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow in the absence of any abnormal blood cells, is a serious complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. While hematological side effects from antipsychotic medications are rare, recent experience with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, has raised the awareness of clinicians to the serious and potentially fatal hematological changes that can occur with antipsychotic medications. A case of perphenazine-induced aplastic anemia in a 23-year-old schizophrenic man is reported.
