Human recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is widely used in hematology and oncology for the treatment of neutropenia, for the restoration of neutrophil production after bone marrow transplantation, for myelodysplastic syndromes, and aplastic anemia. The E. coli  expression system is commonly used for fast recombinant production of rhG-CSF at a large scale. We have applied a novel autoinduction method for the batch expression of rhG-CSF to study whether this new system would increase cell mass and target-protein yield compared to conventional E. coli  cell culture and induction with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). We could demonstrate 3-fold higher culture densities and a 5-fold higher protein yield compared to IPTG induction without the need to monitor cell growth in a shortened 24 h expression procedure. rhG-CSF expressed  in autoinduction media was successfully extracted from E. coli inclusion bodies and refolded by dialysis. After size exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification, rhG-CSF showed similar conformation, biological activity and aggregation profile compared to the commercially available biosimilar  TEVAgrastim(®) (TEVA Pharma AG). Expression by autoinduction is suggested as a cost- and time-effective method for rhG-CSF production.
