A 16-year-old female patient who had been given a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia underwent 2 courses of a combined regimen of corticosteroid pulse therapy and androgen therapy. This proved ineffective. Antilymphocyte globulin therapy was also ineffective. The patient was then given lithium carbonate at a dose of 600 mg/day in combination with an androgen derivative. This had a dramatic effect on her peripheral blood smear. Within 3 weeks after the first course of this treatment, she no longer required red blood cell transfusions. Also, once the lithium carbonate dose was increased to 1,200 mg/day, the patient no longer needed exogenous platelet transfusions. Approximately 6 months after the start of combination therapy, a peripheral blood smear showed entirely normal results. However, 2 months after lithium carbonate was discontinued probably as a result of drug-induced liver dysfunction, both leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia reappeared. Therefore, lithium carbonate was readministered at a dose of 400 mg/day, and later at a dose of 800 mg/day. Again, the patient showed improvements in 3 blood components without any adverse effects. We concluded that lithium therapy was remarkably useful for this patient with intractable and severe aplastic anemia.
