We analyzed 105 cases of aplastic anemia diagnosed between 1958 and 1985 to clarify the variables that are related to prognosis. The most significant variable at diagnosis was reticulocyte count, followed in order by percent bone marrow lymphocyte, red cell turnover rate, T-score severity grade, iron utilization and aplastic anemia study group (AASG) severity grade. Reticulocyte count was the single significant variable in multivariate analysis. Three months after diagnosis, the most significant variable was still the reticulocyte count, followed by AASG severity grade. Changes of variables during the 3 months were not correlated to prognosis. Our result reconfirmed that reticulocyte count was the most important variable related to prognosis.
