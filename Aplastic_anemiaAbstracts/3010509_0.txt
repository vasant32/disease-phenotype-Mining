Ten children between the ages of five and fifteen years old with leukemia (two with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in first remission, four with acute lymphocytic leukemia in first or second remission, one with acute lymphocytic leukemia in relapse, and one with chronic myelocytic leukemia in chronic phase), malignant lymphoma (one) or severe aplastic anemia (one) were given transplants from HLA-matched or mismatched family members between March, 1982 and April, 1984. Two patients died of leukemia relapses on days 107 and 257 following transplantation. One patient died of cardiac failure on day 157. One patient who received HLA-mismatched marrow from his father died of pulmonary edema and acute graft versus host disease on day 32. Six are alive 268-843 days post transplantation. None of the ten patients developed interstitial pneumonia due to cytomegalovirus which is one of the major causes of death reported in other published studies.
