Severe aplastic anemia should be treated with bone marrow transplantation if possible. Various clinical and experimental data support the view that the major pathogenetic defect in SAA is a dysregulated cellular immune response which in turn has a negative effect upon hematopoiesis. Therefore a large percentage of patients react favorably to treatment with immunosuppressive agents as antithymocyte globulin and high-dose methylprednisolone. Data concerning the efficiency of Cyclosporine A treatment are limited until now. We present in this report our own experience with Cyclosporine A treatment in three children with severe aplastic anemia who lack a bone marrow donor. Included is also a review of the present therapeutic possibilities.
