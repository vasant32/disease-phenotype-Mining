A nationwide cooperative incidence survey of leukemia was carried out by the Institute of Hematology, CAMS, from 1986 to 1988. The cooperative survey network covered 46 investigating areas, involving 22 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. More than 60 million person-years were supervised and 1670 new cases identified. The annual incidence rate of leukemia was 2.76/10(5) and the 95% confidence interval of population rate ranged from 2.63/10(5) to 2.89/10(5). The incidence rates in oil fields and polluted areas were significantly higher than those in other areas. The incidence rate of ANLL was 1.62/10(5); ALL, 0.69/10(5); CML, 0.36/10(5); CLL, 0.05/10(5); and special types, 0.03/10(5). The incidence rate and constituent ratio of CLL were significantly lower than those in Europe and America. A peak of ALL incidence rate before age 10 was seen; this rate then declined with increasing age until 30. However, the incidence rates of other leukemia rose with age reaching peaks at old age (50-70). The leukemia rate in males was significantly higher than that in females, both in youth (10-29), caused by ALL, and at old age (greater than or equal to 60), mainly caused by ANLL. The incidence rates of ANLL subtypes (including M2b) are also reported.
