Apart from autoimmune reactions, antibodies to IL-2 receptors were identified in blood sera of linear mice during leukemogenesis. It is indicated that in the course of leukemia establishment, there can be demonstrated antibodies capable of blocking IL-2 receptors on the membrane of activated T lymphocytes and inhibiting IL-2-dependent proliferation of T cells. The blood sera of patients suffering from chronic lymphoid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphocytomas, pure red-cell aplasia, and aplastic anemia showed antibodies against IL-2 receptors. Out of the total number of 52 patients, 23 demonstrated those antibodies. The data obtained should be taken into account in the patients' management using IL-2.
