We compared the effects of CAP and its nitroso derivative on DNA synthesis, CFU-C growth, and cell viability in human bone marrow and on mouse CFU-S viability in vitro. As previously reported from this laboratory, CAP inhibited DNA synthesis only when used in high concentrations (greater than 3 x 10(-4)M), and the inhibition was largely reversible. It also caused a reversible concentration-dependent inhibition of CFU-C growth but did not affect marrow cell viability. In sharp contrast, nitroso-CAP inhibited DNA synthesis in much lower concentrations and caused irreversible inhibition of CFU-C growth and cell death at 5 x 10(-5)M as well as irreversible mouse CFU-S damage. In a rapidly growing human lymphoid cell line, nitroso-CAP caused accumulation of cells in the G2M phase and increasing cell death within the arrested population. We have postulated from these and other observations that CAP-induced aplastic anemia occurs in the predisposed host who provides the milieu for the transformation of the p-NO2 group of the drug to toxic intermediates.
