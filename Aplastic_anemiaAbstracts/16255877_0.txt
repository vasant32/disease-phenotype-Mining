 OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic regimen for treating severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in its early stage. METHODS: Two groups of SAA patients were enrolled in the present study. One was a treatment group including 21 patients being treated with anti-CD(4), CD(8) monoclonal antibodies as well as cyclosporine A. Another was a control group including 20 patients being treated with anti-lymphocyte globulin and cyclosporine A. RESULTS: The response rates in the two groups were more or less some, being 76.2% for the treatment group and 65.0% for the control group (P > 0.05), but the blood routine examination results showed quicker recovery in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05) and the incidences of side effects related to therapy such as fever were less in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of anti-CD(4), CD(8) monoclonal antibodies and cyclosporine A is safe and efficient in treating SAA.
