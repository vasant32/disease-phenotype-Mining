A 51-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using blood stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling. Adenovirus type 11 hemorrhagic cystitis developed and progressed to nephritis and hemophagocytic syndrome. Oral ribavirin was effective not only for the hemorrhagic cystitis and nephritis but also for the hemophagocytic syndrome. Since therapeutic strategies for adenovirus infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have not been established, we present our case and discuss the therapeutic approach.
