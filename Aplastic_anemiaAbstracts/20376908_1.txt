The clinical spectrum of infections caused by non-typhoid Salmonella spp. includes gastroenteritis, enteric fever, bacteremia, and extraintestinal localized complications, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Here we report a patient with severe aplastic anemia developing left iliopsoas abscess caused by non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS), which was successfully treated by prolonged antibiotic treatment and repeated debridement. Our data indicate that aplastic anemia is a risk factor for infection caused by NTS.
