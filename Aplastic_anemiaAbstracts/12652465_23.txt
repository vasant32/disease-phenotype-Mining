A group of 21 consecutive patients aged 4-20 (median 13) years was prospectively allografted using a reduced intensity preparative regimen. The group included both malignant (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia) and nonmalignant (aplastic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, thalassemia major and adrenoleukodystrophy) conditions. Follow-up times ranged between 16 and 1038 days. Four of 21 patients (9.5%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease, and 2 of them died, whereas limited chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 2 of 15 cases. The 100-day mortality was 19%. Median overall survival was above 1038 days, whereas the 34-month survival was 55%. These data show that reduced intensity stem cell transplantation in children permits rapid engraftment from siblings with little toxicity.
