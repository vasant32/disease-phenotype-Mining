We treated a patient in whom acute non-A, non-B hepatitis was complicated by a serum sickness-like syndrome (rash, arthralgias). Serum from this patient demonstrated a fall in C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement levels during the syndrome, in association with circulating IgM immune complexes. Fatal aplastic anemia developed later in the patient. This case illustrates that non-A, non-B hepatitis may be complicated by immune complex features that have previously been emphasized to occur with acute hepatitis B. Additional evidence supporting the occurrence of this clinical picture in non-B forms off viral hepatitis is presented.
