BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia complicating normal pregnancy is a rare event, associated with increased risks for both mother and fetus. CASE: A 30-year-old woman in her fifth pregnancy experienced the complications of aplastic anemia and preeclampsia. The patient had a history of four unsuccessful previous pregnancies also complicated by aplastic anemia, but she was free of the disease in the intervals between the pregnancies. During this last pregnancy she presented at 31 weeks' gestation with symptoms and signs of severe aplastic anemia and preeclampsia. A cesarean section was performed, and a normal infant was born. Supportive therapy, growth factors, prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered, and the patient's general condition improved two weeks after delivery. CONCLUSION: Aplastic anemia may occur during consecutive pregnancies. The gestational age at the onset of the disease and the severity of the symptoms determine the outcome of the pregnancy.
