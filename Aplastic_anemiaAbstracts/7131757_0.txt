Amikacin was studied for clinical effect in 7 patients with acute leukemia, 1 patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia-blastic crisis, 1 patient with malignant lymphoma and 1 patient with aplastic anemia, who were suffered from severe infection such as sepsis, pneumonia or subcutaneous abscess. Most of these patients had bleeding tendency, so amikacin was administered by intravenous drip infusion in a dose of 200 mg--400 mg for 1 hour. Total doses of amikacin were between 3.2 g and 12.6 g. These doses of amikacin gave good response to 3 patients with sepsis, 1 patient with subcutaneous abscess and 1 patient with pneumonia. We didn't observe any side effect most likely associated with amikacin. Therefore, intravenous drip administration of amikacin might be useful drug for management of severe infections in patients of hematological disorder, and seemed to be as safe as intramuscular administration.
