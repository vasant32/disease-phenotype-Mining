Extracts prepared from the urine of normal persons or patients with aplastic anemia or leukemia contain a substance, possibly flavine or a flavine compound, which under suitable conditions of test enhances the growth of larvae of the mosquito, AÃ«des aegypti. This substance is lacking, or is present in much smaller amount, in extracts from the urine of pernicious anemia patients showing symptoms of the disease. Extracts from the urine of the same patients after adequate treatment contain as much of the substance as normal urine extracts.
