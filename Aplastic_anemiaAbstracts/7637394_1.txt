A 15-month-old boy with severe aplastic anemia developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), in which the preparative regimen included 50 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide and anti-lymphocyte globulin for 4 consecutive days. The diagnosis was made based on clinical symptoms and data including, hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, ascites, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia which was refractory to transfusions of platelet concentrate. We gave 2, 3, 5 and 5 mg/day/body of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) followed by heparin and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) effectively and without significant side effect on days 9, 10, 13 and 14, respectively. Clinical and biochemical improvement was steady and dramatic. We suggest that tPA following continuous heparin and PGE1 infusion may be useful in the treatment of VOD even in infantile cases.
