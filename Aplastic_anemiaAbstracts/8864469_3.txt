Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been previously reported as a successful mode of treatment for hepatitis B and associated severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis is one of the causes of SAA. The etiology of SAA caused by non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis is unknown. There is evidence that the immune response and, specifically, T cells and monocytes have a major role in both HCV- and HBV-induced liver damage. The liver damage caused by non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis may be associated with similar mechanisms. We describe an 8-year-old girl who developed SAA post-non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis infection. She was treated by in vivo CAMPATH-1G antibodies followed by T cell depleted HLA-matched BMT and cyclosporin A, resulting in gradual improvement and almost normalization of liver function. We suggest that treatment with CAMPATH-1G followed by T cell-depleted BMT and cyclosporin A could be a novel mode of therapy for viral non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis-induced liver damage and associated SAA.
