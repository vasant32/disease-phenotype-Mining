A 37-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation following cyclophosphamide (CY) and total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). On day +30, a CT scan was carried out because of a mild elevation in liver enzymes, and it revealed a low density area with a sharp border in the left lobe corresponding to the irradiated area. MRI showed a hypersignal intensity on both T1 and T2-weighted images and suggested that hepatic damage was mainly severe fatty change. These abnormalities resolved with no treatment. CY with TLI for adult patients with severe aplastic anemia may induce hepatic injury.
