In BALB/c mice immunodeficiency was induced by the transfer of lymphocytes immune to alloantigen. This model is one of experimental models of AIDS. The work was aimed at the study of disturbances in the immuno--and erythropoiesis in immunodeficient mice. The state of erythropoiesis was evaluated by the level of level of hemoglobin, hematocrit and the content of reticulocytes in peripheral blood, by the number of erythroid bursitis-forming units and the percentage of erythrokaryocytes in the marrow, as well as by the number of colony-forming units in the spleen by days 5 and 8. The study revealed that in BALB/c mice hypoplastic anemia, accompanied by the decreased phagocytic activity of macrophages and the reduced production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, developed on months 5-6 of the disease. Macrophagal dysfunction was supposed to be one of the causes of hypoplastic anemia in immunodeficient mice.
