A 65-year-old female with severe aplastic anemia induced by gold salt, whose hematopoietic recovery was initiated by rhGM-CSF therapy, was reported. The patient has been given a total of 500 mg of gold-sodium thiomalate for treatment of her rheumatoid arthritis. Two months after the final administration of it, she was admitted to our hospital with complaints of palpitation and shortness of breath. The hemogulobin was 5.9 g/dl, the platelet count was 0.5 x 10(4)/microliter, and the leukocyte count was 800/microliters with 19% neutrophils. Her bone marrow showed aplasia, and both of Ham and sugar-water tests were positive. Three times of bolus-methylprednisolone treatment, with or without methenolone acetate, resulted in no definite improvement of peripheral pancytopenia and marrow aplasia. Subsequent subcutaneous rhGM-CSF, 300 micrograms daily for 28 days with oral prednisolone 5 mg and methenolone acetate 40 mg daily, initiated hematopoietic recovery of all three cell lineages in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. The same doses of prednisolone and methenolone acetate were continued after rhGM-CSF administration, and three months later peripheral cytopenia and positive Ham and sugar-water tests disappeared completely.
