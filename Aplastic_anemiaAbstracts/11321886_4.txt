Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) are rare nonpredictable side effects of several drugs. To our knowledge there are no reports on the coexistence of these two disorders. This study presents a 23 year-old man with TEN diagnosed 6 days after treatment with aminophenazone, paracetamol and phenoxymethylpenicillin. The resolution of the skin disorder was observed after few days of treatment with G-CSF and cyclosporin A. In contrast, SAA only partially responded to treatment with these agents.
