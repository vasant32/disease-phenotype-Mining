The purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory effect of thymosin α1 (Tα1) on expression of TOLL-like receptor 9 (TLR9)/indoleamine2, 3-dioxygenase (ido) mRNA in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from children with aplastic anemia (AA). Culture system of bone marrow MSC from AA children and normal children in vitro was established, and the effects of Tα1 on expressions of tlr9 mRNA and ido mRNA of MSC from AA children and normal children were determined by RT-PCR. The results showed that the bone marrow MSC from normal children did not express tlr9 and ido mRNA. Bone marrow MSC from children with AA obviously expressed tlr9 mRNA , but did not express ido mRNA; AA children's MSC treated with Tα1 for 18 hours markedly down-regulated tlr9 mRNA expression, but up-regulated ido mRNA expression in the concentration- and time-dependent ways. It is concluded that Tα1 can up-regulate the expression of ido mRNA in bone marrow MSC from children with AA.
