The authors evaluated results of treatment of 106 children with acquired aplastic anemia. The patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the severity of their disease. Thirty-nine patients were classified as very severe, 30 as severe and 37 as non-severe according to the modified Camitta criteria. Among them, 47 children were treated with oxymetholone and prednisolone. In this group 32 died. Antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) was given to 48 patients and 20 received cyclosporin A (CsA). The results obtained by these two methods are nearly the same and 5 year survival was 61% and 59% respectively. Bone marrow was transplanted in only one child, who is still in complete remission. Statistical analysis showed a steady increase in incidence of aplastic anemia in the years 1987-1989, which might coincide with the Czarnobyl explosion. However, further research is required to prove this point.
