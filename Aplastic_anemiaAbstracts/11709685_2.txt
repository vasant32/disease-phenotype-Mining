OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the prevalence and risks of oral complications in aplastic anemia (AA). STUDY DESIGN: Approximately 79 patients with AA (age, 37 +/- 17 years) and 66 control patients with schizophrenia (age, 33 +/- 12 years) were examined. Records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and radiographic information. Prior medical therapy, laboratory values, disease duration, and medical treatment response were noted for patients with AA. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for oral manifestations in cases and in control subjects. Univariate analysis identified important variables for logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients with AA presented more frequently with oral petechiae (OR = 49; 95% CI, 2.9-825), gingival hyperplasia (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), spontaneous gingival bleeding (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), and herpetic lesions (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5). Prior cyclosporine use was associated with gingival hyperplasia (P =.0001). No other predictors for oral manifestations or treatment outcomes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Oral soft tissue changes and infections were more common in patients with AA. Prior cyclosporine use was predictive of the presence of gingival hyperplasia.
