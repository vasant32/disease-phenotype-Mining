The anemia of patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) was evaluated. Anemia was seen in 32 (91%) of the 35 FAP patients, more often with progression of the disease. The incidence of macrocytic hypochromic anemia was the most common type (40%). In 14 autopsied and 2 biopsied cases, no amyloid deposition was detected in the bone marrow. Thirteen (81%) of the 16 FAP patients showed hypoplastic bone marrow. Bone marrow aspiration of 2 patients revealed a decreased ratio of erythrocytic/myelocytic cells. The plasma levels of vitamin B12 and folate were within normal ranges. Neither oral nor intravenous administration of iron had any effect on the anemia of FAP patients. Intravenous erythropoietin elevated blood hemoglobin levels and blood pressure in 2 patients. Orthostatic hypotension, one of the most common symptoms of FAP, was unexpectedly improved. Secondary hypoplastic anemia is common in FAP, but treatment of anemia in this disease using erythropoietin is promising.
