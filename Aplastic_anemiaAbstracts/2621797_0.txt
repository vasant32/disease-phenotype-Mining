A 7-year-old boy was admitted to our department complaining pale face and subcutaneous bleeding in August, 1987. Peripheral blood analysis showed pancytopenia of WBC 2,600/microliter, RBC 148 x 10(4)/microliter and platelets 5,000/microliter. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypocellularity. Granulocytes 104/microliter, reticulocytes 4,290/microliter and platelets 5,000/microliter were compatible with the diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia based on the criteria of the Ministry of Public Welfare in Japan. Prednisolone (PDN) was initially indicated and bolus methylprednisolone, metenolone and ALG therapy followed with no hematological improvement. Fifteen months after admission, in addition to 0.5-1 mg/kg/day of metenolone, Cyclosporin A (CyA) was started at a dose of 12 mg/kg/day for a week and 6 mg/kg/day thereafter. After a week from administration of CyA, 1 mg/kg/day of PDN was given because his bleeding tendency became worse. But this combination was complicated with liver damage and hyperglycemia to discontinue both drugs. These adverse effects were subsided within 7 days by cessation of the drugs. CyA was started again at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day without any response for 4 weeks. Then PDN was added together at a reduced dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg/day. Hematological response was obtained promptly. Granulocytes reached 1,500/microliter, hemoglobin 10.2 g/dl and platelets 26,000/microliter after 3 months of therapy. Afterward the patient became transfusion independent. The most effective method of CyA administration for aplastic anemia is still controversial. Alternative use of CyA, considering combination of steroids or anabolic steroids, in patients who failed to respond to conventional immunosuppressive treatments should be further investigated.
