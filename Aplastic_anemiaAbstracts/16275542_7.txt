 BACKGROUND: Invasive aspergillosis is a challenge to the internist, and difficulties diagnosing the disease remain an everlasting problem. METHODS: We reviewed the data of 65 patients with hematological malignancies and aplastic anemia who were tested for the galactomannan (GM) antigen of Aspergillus between March and November 2003. RESULTS: GM antigen levels were false-positive in at least two consecutive samples in 5 out of 23 patients who did not have evidence of invasive aspergillosis (false positivity rate of 21.7%) but who received concomitant piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) compared to 0 of 28 patients who did not. DISCUSSION: The use of P/T in febrile, neutropenic patients decreases the specificity of GM antigen testing, which may lead to incorrect and unnecessary attempts at diagnosis and therapy.
