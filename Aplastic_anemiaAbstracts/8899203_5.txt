CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia in the absence of HIV infection is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown cause. Here we report a patient with idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia, presenting with an opportunistic Rhodococcus equi infection. When aplastic anemia developed subsequently, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed. Complete restoration of immune function was observed. We conclude that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation presents a potentially curative therapy for CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia.
