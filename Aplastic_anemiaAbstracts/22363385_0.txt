Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements. The incidences of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in patients with congenital coagulation disorders and chronic thrombocytopenia are very low. In this paper, a case of late stent thrombosis within a drug-eluting stent occurring after platelet transfusion in a patient with aplastic anemia is presented. The authors' observations emphasize the risks of platelet transfusion and the authors' support withholding such a treatment unless vitally indicated, in patients with coronary artery stent implantation and even in those on dual antiplatelet therapy.
