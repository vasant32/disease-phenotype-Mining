We tested an in vitro system simulating bleeding time reported by Kratzer et al. Primary hemostasis was studied perfusing an artificial vessel with citrated blood under a constant pressure of 40 mmHg, measuring the blood volume perfused (bleeding volume) and the time until blood flow stopped (bleeding time). The artificial vessel consists of a glass capillary simulating arteriole and a filter covered with collagen type I to provide a surface for the adhesion of platelets. The bleeding volume (mean +/- SD microliters) was 317.7 +/- 93.8 in controls (n = 19), 487.3 +/- 242.1 in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 9), 666.8 +/- 224.1 in aplastic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 4), greater than 820 in von Willebrand's disease (n = 3), 231.0 +/- 74.5 in hemophilia A (n = 3), 499.0 +/- 269.4 in liver cirrhosis (n = 6), and 457.7 +/- 229.0 in myeloproliferative disorders (n = 11). When citrated blood was applied to this system after incubation with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to von Willebrand factor or platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), bleeding volume was significantly increased while no effects were observed after incubation with MoAb to GPIIb/IIIa, factor VIII: CAg and factor XIIIa. These data suggest that in vitro model of primary hemostasis could be used for not only diagnosing bleeding disorders although 'time' is not reliable, but also investigating the mechanisms of hemostasis.
