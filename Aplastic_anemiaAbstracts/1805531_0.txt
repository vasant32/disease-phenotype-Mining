From May 1989 to March 1991 60 bone marrow transplants were performed--41 allogeneic and 19 autologous--in patients with malignant and nonmalignant hemopathies and solid tumors. The transplant related mortality was 19.4% and 10.5% for allografts and autografts, respectively. The projected relapse free survival at 22 months in patients with malignant hemopathies who underwent allotransplantation in early phase was 81% and, in patients in advanced phase 21.4% (p less than 0.001). In patients with aplastic anemia the actuarial survival at 22 months is 60%. In autografted patients, only one failed to have full engraftment and is dependent on platelet support at day 79. Follow-up in all autografts is less than one year. These preliminary results of our bone marrow transplant program show low morbidity and mortality related to transplantation and suggest significant therapeutic effect.
