OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between thrombopoietin (Tpo) levels and reticulated platelet (RP), blood platelet count (BPC), maturity of megakaryocytes in patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (CITP), and the prediction evaluation according to Tpo levels. METHODS: Serum level of Tpo was measured by a sandwich-ELISA procedure, RP by flow cytometry after stained with thizole orange (TO), and maturity of megakaryocytes by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). RESULTS: The serum level of Tpo was (204.05 +/- 65.70) ng/L in 23 normal controls and (345.46 +/- 222.23) ng/L in 33 patients with CITP, being no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with controls, serum Tpo levels in 22 aplastic anemia(AA) patients [(1427.62 +/- 468.84) ng/L] and 10 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients [(596.09 +/- 462.95) ng/L] were increased significantly (P < 0.05). The RPC was significantly lower in AA and AML patients (P < 0.05). The RP% was increased significantly in CITP and AML patients (P < 0.05). The Tpo level was higher in CITP patients with no response to glucocorticoid therapy than in those with response (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Serum level of Tpo was not increased in patients with CITP. The RP%, RPC and Tpo levels could reflect thrombocytopoiesis and differentiate the causes of thrombocytopenia. The serum level of Tpo could be useful in prediction of the response to therapy in CITP patients.
