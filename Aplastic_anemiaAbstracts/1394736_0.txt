Based on the incidence survey of leukemia and aplastic anemia (AA) from 1986 to 1988, Case control studies (1257 new leukemia cases and 339 new AA cases) were carried out according to the type of leukemia and AA in order to better understand the epidemiologic characteristics of the diseases. Controls were matched randomly (age, sex and ethnic group) from the same population. The data were analyzed with the conditional Logistic multi-regression model and calculated on an IBM-PC/XT. The risk factors of M2a were found to be X-rays, antipyretics, benzene, pesticides and bimolane; that of M3 was chloramphenicol; that of M5 was X-rays; and that of other ANLLs was phenylbutazone. The risk factors of ALL were chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone and family members with cancer; those of CML were X-rays and hepatitis; those of CLL were chloramphenicol and benzene; those of AAA were antipyretics and hepatitis; and that of CAA ws X-rays.
