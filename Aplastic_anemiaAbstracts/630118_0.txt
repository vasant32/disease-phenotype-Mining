A 43/4-yr-old black girl with acquired aplastic anemia had an increase in total hemoglobin (Hb) from 4.5 to 16.8 g/dl and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) from 0.8 g/dl (18.8%) to 9.6 g/dl (60.2%) following combined androgen-adrenal steroid therapy. Discontinuation of the drugs was followed by a decline in both HbF and total Hb. Reinstitution of the combined steroids prompted a second rise in total and fetal hemoglobin. During these responses the subject's erythrocytes exhibited an increased i antigen score and a low level of red cell carbonic anhydrase. The glycine:alanine ratio at position 136 of the gamma chains of HbF was of the fetal type (proportion of chains with glycine residues, 0.74). Hemoglobin A2 was low (0.4%). The synthesis of alpha and non-alpha chains was balanced. These results indicate that the stimulation of red cell proliferation in this subject, in response to androgen therapy, resulted in the production of cells with several characteristics of "fetal" erythrocytes.
