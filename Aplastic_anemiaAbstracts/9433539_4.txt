Ticlopidine is an oral antiplatelet agent frequently utilized in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease and is rarely associated with severe bone marrow suppression, typically aplastic anemia. Reports in the literature of isolated agranulocytosis are few, although they may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A case is reported of an elderly woman who developed febrile agranulocytosis several weeks after commencing ticlopidine but who had a favorable outcome after cessation of that drug and treatment with filgastrim.
