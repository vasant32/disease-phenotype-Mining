Fanconi's anemia (FA) is a paradigm for congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia and predisposition to malignancies. Identification of the disease at birth is based on characteristic physical malformations, as hematologic manifestations at birth are extremely rare. We report a case of FA in a newborn who presented with anophthalmia, unilateral radial ray defect, hemivertebrae and thrombocytopenia.
