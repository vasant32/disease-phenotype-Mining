Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans were observed in three patients treated with androgen-anabolic steroids for aplastic anemia. These patients formed a unique subset of patients with aplastic anemia in that they all had Fanconi's anemia, all demonstrated glucose intolerance following institution of androgen therapy, all had received androgen for at least 42 months prior to death, and all had coexistent benign liver cell tumors. Androgen-induced glucose intolerance may play a major role in the pathogenesis of both the pancreatic and hepatic abnormalities.
