We examined ophthalmologically a patient with drug-induced aplastic anemia. The patient had good visual acuity and full visual fields, but small round hemorrhages and small red dots were seen ophthalmoscopically in both fundi. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescence from the early to late phases, indicating microaneurysms. We believe that retinal microaneurysms are not rare in association with anemia.
