It has been well known that Qigong keeping one in a self-controlling condition is a traditional method for promoting human health, prolong life and treating several kinds of diseases refractory to other remedies. As aplastic anemia (AA) is one of the disease poor responded to conventional therapy. Qigong was applied to a number of AA patients. Five principle methods of Qigong were practiced as fellows: (1) Regulating respiration consciously to tonify Qi; (2) ameliorating the digestive function on tiptoe; (3) holding one's head for tranquilizing; (4) massaging the loins to nourish the essence; (5) at one's ease to regulate the circulation of Qi and blood. Besides according to the various conditions of different patients, some other Qigong methods such as for anti-inflammation and analgesia, diuretic, massage to viscerals etc. were also applied for symptomatic treatment. In authors' previous work by ABC immune enzymic assay, the authors have shown in most AA patients, their suppressor T cell (Ts) were significantly increased, the helper T cell (Th) dropped resulting in a decreased ratio of Th/Ts. The changes of T-cells subsets were investigated in 10 cases treated by Qigong. For the patients in Qigong therapy, their Th and the ratio of Th/Ts were greatly elevated than those without Qigong treatment (P less than 0.02). In addition, Ts went down but not significantly in Qigong treating patients. Because the change of T cell subsets play an important role in the pathogenesis of AA, the reversion of the change by treating with Qigong may be a promising way for recovery of the AA patients.
