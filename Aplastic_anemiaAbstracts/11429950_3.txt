Hepatic adenomatosis is a rarely encountered liver disease. It is an entity distinct from hepatocellular adenoma and is characterized by the presence of more than 10 hepatic adenomas. We present the multiplanar and multiphasic dynamic magnetic resonance findings of hepatic adenomatosis in a 15-year-old adolescent who developed transfusional hemosiderosis and had received anabolic steroids for the treatment of aplastic anemia.
