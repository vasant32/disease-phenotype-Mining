The serum thyroid hormones were measured in 50 patients with aplastic anemia (AA). Serum T3 and T4 levels were significantly lower, especially in the elderly and in those in chronic AA, while they were normal in acute AA. There was no obvious difference with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It was suggested that the result may be caused by euthyroid sick syndrome, a protective adaptation that helps in classifying and evaluating the prognosis of the disease.
