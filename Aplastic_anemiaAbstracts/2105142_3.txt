A case of aplastic anemia associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis was initially successfully treated by bone marrow transplantation. The patient subsequently developed fulminant hepatic failure. Fulminant hepatic failure is rare in bone marrow transplantation and only occurs in association with aplastic anemia associated with viral hepatitis. This case helps to highlight the relationships between the immune system, hepatitis, and bone marrow failure.
