Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive inherited syndrome characterized by congenital abnormalities, aplastic anemia, and a high likelihood of developing cancer. We describe a child who presented with 2 synchronous solid tumors (Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma), later found to have FA, who developed severe toxicity and died after a first cycle of chemotherapy. Our experience emphasizes that a predisposing genetic condition should be sought in cases of multiple tumors and that managing FA patients with cancer can be particularly difficult.
