A patient who had received multiple transfusions for the treatment of aplastic anemia was studied. There were antibodies against allogeneic granulocytes and lymphocytes in her serum. Granulocyte antibodies were detected by their effect on phagocytosis-associated hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) activity, while lymphocyte antibodies were detected by their cytotoxicity. Granulocyte antibodies were in the IgG and IgM fractions. Prior absorption of this patient's serum with granulocytes or lymphocytes from a single donor eliminated its inhibitory effect on phagocytosis-associated HMS activity of that donor's granulocytes. Studies of many unrelated donors and the patient's seven siblings revealed that her serum inhibited the granulocytes from all of these individuals with the sole exception of the granulocytes harvested from her one HL-A identical sister. The evidence suggests that this patient's antibodies are directed against HL-A antigens or some cell surface antigens coded for by loci closely linked to the HL-A genes.
