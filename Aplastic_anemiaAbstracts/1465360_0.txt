The diagnosis of systemic haematological disorders is often confirmed by bone marrow biopsy which is usually performed "blind". False-negative results may be obtained because this method is restricted to a small part of the blood-forming organ. Bone marrow scintigraphy has the potential of detecting the distribution of active haematopoietic bone marrow and to localize infiltrative lesions. This case report of a patient with pancytopenia demonstrates that the diagnosis of aplastic anaemia can be confirmed by bone marrow scintigraphy in combination with probe-guided bone marrow biopsy.
