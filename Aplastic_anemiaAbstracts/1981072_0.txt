We reported five cases of listeriosis (sepsis and meningitis) in the elderly in our hospital during the last 4 years, where no cases of listeriosis had been found. These 5 cases had diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, chronic respiratory failure, gastric ulcer and aplastic anemia respectively as their underlying diseases. At the onset of listeriosis, 3 cases received corticosteroid and 3 cases received H2-blocker. 2 patients were cured and 3 patients died. Three autopsy cases had meningitis or meningoencephalitis and 2 cases of these autopsy cases had granulomatous changes in these spleens. In serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), 4 cases were 4b and 1 cases was 1b. All 5 strains were resistant to 3rd generation cephems. Wide uses of 3rd generation cephems and H2-blocker may be one of the reasons for the recent increase of listeriosis. Ingestion of contaminated food is the pathogenetic mechanism for initiating L. monocytogenes infections. And following the change of eating habits and the increase of imported foods, food-born listeriosis may increase. We suppose the increase of L. monocytogenes infections and must give attention to L. monocytogenes infections.
