A male patient with severe aplastic anemia was admitted for bone marrow transplantation. While waiting for a donor, high doses of methylprednisolone, anabolic steroid and granulocyte colony stimulating factor were given without response. Deferoxamine was administered for prophylaxis of hemochromatosis because of high level of ferritin. Acute right lower abdominal pain and pyrexia developed. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and appendectomy was performed. The histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed necrotizing hemorrhagic appendicitis with numerous hyphae of Mucorales. Though anti-fungal agent (amphotericin B) administration was continued, he subsequently developed ileo-cecal abscess and eventually died due to myoglobinuric nephropathy caused by extensive necrosis of the iliopsoas muscle. Autopsy revealed dissemination of hyphae of Mucorales in lungs, kidneys, large vessels and muscle of the bilateral lower limbs. Systemic vascular invasion and embolization of fungal hyphae were also observed. However, culture of exudate sampled from ileocecum yielded no Mucorales. It was emphasized that antemortem diagnosis and effective anti-fungal treatments are essential for the management of intestinal mucormycosis. The relation ship between mucormyocosis and deferoxamine was also discussed.
