Two cases are reported of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with preleukemic states and 13 other cases in the literature are reviewed. Hypoplastic anemias, which transiently resolved spontaneously or with steroid therapy, were seen most commonly. Acquired hypoplastic anemias, even when associated with spontaneous resolution, may at times represent a preleukemic state.
