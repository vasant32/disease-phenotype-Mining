A unique form of subacute panencephalitis developed in a child with aplastic anemia 8 months after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). It was characterized by parenchymal infiltration of CD3 lymphocytes, a marked increase in the number of microglia strongly expressing HLA-DR antigens in both the gray and white matter, and diffuse degeneration of the cerebral white matter. The onset of neurological symptoms coincided with the development of chronic systemic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Cellular infiltrates in the CNS lesions were exclusively CD3 lymphocytes intermingled with a small number of monocytes labeled with CD68. There was a preponderance of cells of the CD45RB phenotype. The pathological changes in visceral organs were consistent with those of chronic GVHD. In addition, scrutiny of immunohistochemistry disclosed sparse infiltration of CD3 lymphocytes and diffuse gliosis in the cerebral white matter of another child with chronic GVHD who died 9 months after allogeneic BMT. These cases are suggestive of a potential risk of CNS involvement in GVHD.
