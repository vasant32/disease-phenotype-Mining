The natural hypoxic hypoxia enhances the synthesis processes and decrease the concentration balance in cytokine rets in patients with depression of hematopoiesis. It is established that the patients with aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, in contrast with patients with acute leucosis, chronic myelolecosis and erythroid myeloma, have quite high values of IL-2, which can be involved in the organization of full-fledgee response to antigen stimuli. The application of hypoxic hypoxia as an additional method in treatment of aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura has no side effects and contraindications.
