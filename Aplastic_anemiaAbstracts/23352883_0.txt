Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare inherited bone marrow failure characterized by excessively short telomeres in highly proliferative tissues. These abnormalities are due to disturbance of the telomere maintenance machinery. The clinical presentation is characterized by skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and mucosal leukoplakia. All these mucocutaneous features are rare in childhood: they usually appear between 5 and 10 years of age. In young children, the initial presentation can associate bone marrow failure and neurological or ocular problems: Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, respectively. Clinical progression of the disease can lead to aplastic anemia (86% of all patients) and to pulmonary or hepatic complications. These patients also have an increased risk of cancer. Diagnosis is often suspected on bone marrow failure with no clinical or biological abnormalities compatible with Fanconi anemia diagnosis. The telomere length study can be helpful for diagnosis in case of aplastic anemia in children before studying gene mutations. Until now, 6 genes (DKC1, TERT, TERC, NOLA2, NOLA3, TINF2) have been identified in dyskeratosis congenita. Transmission of the disease can be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked. In half of the cases, the genetic abnormality is unknown. Treatment of DC has to be adapted to each patient, from symptomatic or androgenic treatment to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
