Invasive mycotic infections are becoming more commonplace in immune-compromised hosts. Aspergillus species is the most commonly encountered fungal genus in our environment causing paranasal sinus fungal infection. Aspergillus paranasal sinus infections in the healthy host are readily treated and controlled. In the immune-compromised host this common organism can rapidly become fatal even if recognized and treated appropriately. We present a case history of a patient who died from her disease despite radical surgery and antifungicidal therapy. Recent methods for early diagnosis will be reviewed. Only one other case has been reported in the literature of a patient developing fulminant aspergillosis sinusitis while receiving amphotericin B.
