Although younger age is associated with favorable prognosis in adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for aplastic anemia (AA), other pretransplantation factors may be more important than age. We retrospectively analyzed the impact of older age on transplantation outcomes and survival in a total of 225 adult patients with AA who underwent allo-HSCT: 57 patients >40 years old (older patient group [OPG]) and 168 patients ≤40 years old (younger patient group [YPG]). Age at allo-HSCT ≤40 years, time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT ≤6 months, and matched related donor (MRD) were favorable prognostic factors in all study patients. Risk analysis of survival in the OPG showed that age >50 years was the only poor prognostic factor. Survival did not differ significantly between the YPG and patients <50 years old in the OPG. In conclusion, patients between the ages of 41 and 50 years with severe AA and MRDs should undergo allo-HSCT as early as possible to optimize survival.
