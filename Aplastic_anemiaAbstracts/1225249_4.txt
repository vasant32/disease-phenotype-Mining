A Fanconi's disease was discovered in a 9 1/2 year old girl. She received androgens daily and died with a severe aplastic attack after 4 years of evolution. Hepatic involvement of treatment with androgens was regularly checked. Autopsy however, showed a multinodular adenoma of the liver without any malignant manifestation. Relationships between aplastic anemia, long-term treatment with androgens and tumour of the liver are discussed. The difficulty of in vivo diagnosis is emphasized.
