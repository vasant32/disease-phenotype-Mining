The authors retrospectively analyzed the records of 33 children with acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) diagnosed from July 1998 to October 2007 and first treated by immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Serial hematologic parameters, complications, transfusion requirements, and time to response were assessed. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was attempted in 7 patients after failure of IST (n = 6) or relapse following an initial response to IST (n = 1). One child died of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Thirty of the 33 patients are alive and well after a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 7-116 months). Overall (transfusion-independent) response to IST was 73% (24/33). The actuarial 5 years survival rate was 89.4%. In this study, all patients with SAA received IST as standard front-line therapy. Approximately three-fourths of patients with SAA have durable recovery and excellent overall survival.
