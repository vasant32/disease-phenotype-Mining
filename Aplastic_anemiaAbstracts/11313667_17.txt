The Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) Registry of North America is a detailed database of patients with DBA from the United States and Canada. To date, 354 patients have been registered. From this database an analysis of the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for DBA was undertaken. Of the 20 transplanted patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of DBA, eight underwent an allogeneic HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) and 12 an alternative donor SCT. The median age at transplant for all patients was 6 years 2 months; 3 years 10 months vs 9 years 1 month for HLA-matched sibling and alternative donor SCT, respectively. All of the HLA-matched sibling transplants were done using a non-irradiation-containing regimen, whereas the majority of alternative donor transplants were performed using total body irradiation. The survival for HLA-matched sibling vsalternative donor transplant was 87.5% +/- 11.7% vs 14.1% +/- 12.1% at greater than 5 years from SCT (P = 0.015). The use of HLA-matched sibling SCT should be considered for all patients with suitable donors. However, alternative donor SCT in DBA must be approached cautiously, the potential for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or hematopoietic malignancy not withstanding.
