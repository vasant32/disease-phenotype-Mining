3 patients with pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia are reported. Management throughout most of the pregnancy consisted of supportive care. In 2 patients an improvement in blood counts occurred after delivery and, in 1 of these, the pancytopenia recurred during a subsequent pregnancy. In 1 case no improvement occurred after delivery and the patient ultimately required an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The outcome of these 3 cases demonstrates that pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia can be managed successfully. The improvement that often occurs after delivery suggests a pathogenetic role for pregnancy in the development of this disease.
