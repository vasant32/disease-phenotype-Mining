The mechanism of benzene toxicity has been extremely difficult to fully characterize. Much progress has been made in assessing the relative potency of benzene metabolites but specific pathways to leukemia remain to be determined. Metabolite and mechanistic studies will have to focus on aplastic anemia and MDS and separate endpoints. This may serve to clarify the array of metabolite effects and consequent disparate effects. Biomarker research can contribute to the understanding of the toxicity process. The significance of understanding benzene toxicity will also lead to better clinical treatment of aplastic anemia and therapy-related MDS and AML, detection of populations particularly susceptible to benzene toxicity, screening of populations with suspected or unknown exposures, and determination of meaningful values for occupational and individual health risk while effectively monitoring ongoing exposures for early signs of toxicity.
