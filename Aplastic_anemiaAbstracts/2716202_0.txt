Sixteen-years-old female with severe aplastic anemia received a therapy combined with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), high-dose methylprednisolone (m-PSL) and danazol. At the hospitalization, hematological examination demonstrated as follows; reticulocyte 21,000/microliters, granulocyte 350/microliters, platelet 10,000/microliters and hypocellular bone marrow. Treatment schedule were 1) m-PSL 1,000 mg (day 1-4), 500 mg (5-8)--then tapered. 2) ALG lg/day (day 4-8) 3) danazol 600 mg/day. During ALG administration, leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia appeared but thereafter hematological recovery was obtained and the patient was free from supportive care. She developed mild diabetes mellitus and moderate liver dysfunction, nevertheless, both of which were controlled. At 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, hematological examination demonstrated as follows; reticulocyte 236,000/microliters, granulocyte 1,900/microliters, platelet 56,000/microliters and normocellular bone marrow. Although this immunosuppressive therapy was remarkably effective to this patient, immunological relation to the onset of aplastic anemia was not demonstrated in in vitro examination. This combined therapy seems to be effective one for patients with severe aplastic anemia.
