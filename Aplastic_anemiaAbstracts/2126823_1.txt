A 7-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital because of fever and multiple petechiae following non-A non-B hepatitis. Peripheral blood on admission showed pancytopenia, and she was diagnosed to have hepatitis-associated severe aplastic anemia. She was treated with oxymetholone, prednisolone, 2 courses of bolus methylprednisolone, 2 courses of high dose gamma-globulin therapy and ALG (Pressimmun) without success. Nineteen months after diagnosis. ALG (Lymphoser) and bolus methylprednisolone followed by oxymetholone and prednisolone were tried. Hematologic conditions improved gradually, and have become normal except mild thrombocytopenia over a year. This case suggests that there is a difference in clinical efficacy between ALG preparations, and this observation gives the basis of repeating ALG therapy using a different preparation even if the preceding one has failed.
