Clinicopathologic records and neuropathologic tissues of 109 patients who underwent necropsy after treatment with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were examined. Underlying disorders included leukemia (70), aplastic anemia (25), solid tumors (7), lymphoma (5), Hodgkin's disease (1) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (1). There were 34 females and 75 males, ranging in age from 2 to 56 years. Survival after transplantation averaged 3.6 months. The most common findings were cerebrovascular lesions (29), including hematomas, hemorrhagic necrosis, and infarcts. Central nervous system infections comprised the next most common finding, including 10 fungal and four bacterial infections. A recurrence of underlying malignancy for which transplant had been performed occurred in five patients. Leukoencephalopathy of varying severity was found in eight patients, half of whom had received intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial radiation. Patients with systemic graft-versus-host disease had a variety of nonspecific neuropathologic findings in the nervous system; however, nearly half (44%) showed no detectable changes. Other nonspecific alterations included hypoxic/ischemic changes, vascular siderocalcinosis, and neuroaxonal spheroids (associated with hemorrhage or necrosis). These findings provide a guide as to likely causes of a neurologic syndrome in a patient who has undergone BMT, and can be compared with neuropathologic findings in other forms of immunosuppression.
