The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical value of the platelet antibody screening and typing in platelets transfusion by using microcolumn gel immunoassay (MGIA). The platelets antigen-antibody reactions including the antibody screen and blood crossmatch were detected by MGIA. The results indicated that the detection of platelet antibody showed positive in 30 cases of aplastic anemia (AA), 11 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 24 out of 25 cases of leukemia and 1 out of cases of other diseases, while detection of platelet antibody showed negative in 20 normal volunteer donors. The number of platelet antibody crossmatch coincidence in 112 specimens of AA, 42 specimens of MDS and 95 specimens of leukemia were 45, 20 and 40, the coincidence rates were 40.18%, 47.62% and 42.11%. The mean corrected count increment (CCI) in 20 patients received platelet transfusion many times was 18.2 after crossmatch and 4.7 before crossmatch. It is concluded that the positive rate of platelet antibody screening is very high in patients with hematologic malignancies, the coincidence rate of platelet antibody crossmatch in 249 blood samples is between 40% and 48%, and the efficiency of using crossmatched platelets in clinic is enhanced significantly.
