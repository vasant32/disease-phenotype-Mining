The clinical course of hypoplastic anemia (HA) has been assessed in 21 patients with uterine bleedings. The disease was associated with severe onset and progress, profound pancytopenia and myelodepression or even critical states. Superimposed infectious inflammatory and other diseases aggravated HA by promoting hemorrhagic events, especially uterine bleedings. An initial treatment using packed erythrocyte transfusions and glucocorticoid hormones reversed anemia and hemorrhages in 11 of 21 patients with HA. Splenectomy was performed in 8 and ovariectomy in 1 of 11 patients whose blood and bone marrow tests improved after the treatment. The other 12 patients were maintained on transfusion and drug regimens. The efficacy of splenectomy and other interventions for HA in women with uterine bleedings depends on an response to received treatments.
