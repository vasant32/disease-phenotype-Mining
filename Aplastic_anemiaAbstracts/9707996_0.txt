We report five episodes of severe aplastic anemia (AA) followed by spontaneous remission in three patients. They were classified as transient aplastic anemia (TAA). Two were females and one male of 32, 56 and 41 years of age, respectively; the man had two recurrences. They had been in contact with insecticides, solvents or drug ingestion. The three had fever, anemia and muco-cutaneous purpura. Supportive measures were used (transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets, antibiotics, corticosteroids and danazol, the latter two given for ten days in three episodes). They showed spontaneous remission after 16 to 45 days of evolution. The patients did not suffer infection or myeloproliferative disorders which might explain the AA. Transient AA is infrequent and should be considered a variant of AA.
