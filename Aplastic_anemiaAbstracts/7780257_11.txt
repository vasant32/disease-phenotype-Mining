Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves conditioning with cyclophosphamide and, for leukemic patients, total body irradiation (TBI). Based on the concern that this may lead to later neuropsychologic impairment in children, a longitudinal study was conducted. Thirty pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients, treated for leukemia or severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and their sibling donors, were given a neuropsychological examination in 1986 and 1988. A third follow-up study of patients treated before 12 years of age was undertaken in 1990-91. We present longitudinal data on patients treated with BMT when 3-11 (n = 15) and 12-17 (n = 11) years old. No neuropsychological deficits were found in the older group, or among non-irradiated SAA patients. In the first follow-up, children treated with BMT, including TBI at 3-11 years of age, performed less well than donors on tasks involving perceptual and fine-motor speed. In the second follow-up, this group of patients also demonstrated a slight deficit in non-verbal problem solving. An additional relative decline in verbal reasoning was noted in the third follow-up, 5.5-10 years after treatment. Alertness to signs of developmental difficulties in children treated with BMT, including TBI, is recommended.
