Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare etiology for congenital anemia, but this diagnosis should be considered when aregenerative hypoplastic anemia occurs in infancy. A term infant girl received a red blood cell transfusion at birth for neonatal anemia (hemoglobin 75 g/L) initially attributed to abruptio placentae. There were no additional investigations. Hemoglobin gradually decreased during the first 4 weeks of life, leading to severe anemia and death despite transfusions. A postmortem diagnosis of DBA was made by extraction of DNA collected on blood filter paper showing a deletion in RPS19 gene. Neonatal anemias should be carefully investigated and close follow-up should be performed during the first months of life, even if there is an obvious hemorrhagic etiology.
