Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is an effective immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia (AA). We administered ATG combined with cyclosporine (CyA), to 9 patients (4 men and 5 women; median age, 55 years). AA was severe in 8 patients and moderate in 1. The ATG and CyA regimen was the initial treatment for 3 patients, but sequential treatment for the other 6, who were refractory to other agents. Peripheral T lymphocytes, including CD4-positive and CD8-positive cells, decreased rapidly after treatment. Although 1 patient died of pulmonary hemorrhage during the 6-month period following treatment with this combined regimen, 3 showed a favorable response, 2 moderate response, and 3 no response at all. Adverse drug reactions, including transient fever and rash, were not severe. These findings suggested that ATG and CyA in combination are a safe and effective immunosuppressive regimen for initial and refractory patients with AA.
