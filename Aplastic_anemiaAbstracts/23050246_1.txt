 BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia is a well-recognized form of marrow failure. The incidence of aplastic anemia is subjected to wide variation. Most cases are acquired and immune-mediated but there are also inherited forms. AIM: The study was conducted to assess the magnitude of the problem, morphological changes and determinants of aplastic anemia in North Bengal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study had been conducted for a period of one year among 5 to 70 years age group. Initially complete blood count followed by bone marrow examination was done for diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 48 cases, 38 (79.17%) had hypocellular diagnosed as aplastic anemia, 5 (10.42%) each had normocellular and hypercellular bone marrow. Histopathology shows that 30 (78.95%) cases had increased iron stores in bone marrow and 8 (21.05%) cases had decreased iron stores. Subjects less than 20 years of age mostly (31.58%) suffered from non-severe disease in contrast to subjects in higher age groups who had severe or very severe disease, though the trend was not significantly different (Ï‡(2) for linear trend 0.171, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study shows aplastic anemia is a common hematological abnormality among peripheral pancytopenia in North Bengal region where males were affected more than females.
