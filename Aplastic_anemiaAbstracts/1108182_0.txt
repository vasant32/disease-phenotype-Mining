A report is presented on 13 clinical bone marrow transplantations (BMT). Six of 6 patients with refractory aplastic anemia are presently alive with partial to complete hemopoetic reconstitution now lasting up to 3 years and more. It is shown that after immunosuppression with ALG and cyclophosphamide, followed by BMT, the patient's own hemopoetic system can recover. Two failures occurred in patients over 50 years of age and in one who had donor transfusions before the graft. Two of 4 patients grafted for acute refractory leukemia are alive, one being in complete remission on day 140. One died from interstitial pneumonia and one had no take although the donor was an identical twin. This patient had been on a maintenance program which included active immunotherapy.
