A 1-yr-old Japanese male infant developed hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (AA), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporine A (CsA) was administered without any appreciable effects. Laboratory examination of the patient's serum obtained before therapy revealed various autoantibodies, such as PA-IgG, anti-platelets, anti-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (Abs) in addition to anti-DRS-1 Abs and anti-moesin Abs, both of which are known to be detectable in approximately 40% of all patients presenting with AA. He was therefore treated with 17.5 mg/kg/d rituximab 5.5 months after ATG/CsA therapy. The same rituximab therapy was repeated three times once a month thereafter. His neutrophil counts started to increase 50 d after the first rituximab therapy and he achieved a complete remission at 16 months after the last rituximab administration. All of the autoantibodies including anti-ssDNA, dsDNA, DRS-1, and moesin became undetectable when he attained the remission. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy may be effective in a subset of patients with AA characterized by the presence of autoantibodies.
