A 12-year-old Japanese boy suffered from severe acute hepatitis and pancytopenia. The patient underwent successful bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sister. Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA of genotype 1a and IgM-class antibody against the virus were detected in sera at the onset of hepatitis. TTV/1a DNA and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody levels were undetectable on the 16th and 46th days after the onset of illness, respectively. Anti-TTV/1a IgG antibody was positive throughout the observation period. Sequential viral load and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody suggested a primary infection of TTV/1a. Genomic sequence of the virus coincided with that of the original strain first isolated from human. TTV DNA was quantified at 130 copies in 10(5) bone marrow mononuclear cells, which suggested that infection of hematopoietic cells might be the cause of aplasia. This is the first report of TTV hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia assessed by the anti-TTV antibodies and viral load in peripheral blood and bone marrow.
