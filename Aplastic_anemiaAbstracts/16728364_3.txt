Mucormycosis is an uncommon, severe, life-threatening fungal infection in the immunocompromised host. Mucormycosis with aplastic anemia is seen rarely. Only a few cases of cardiac mucormycosis with aplastic anemia have been reported in the literature. The authors present a case with severe aplastic anemia that did not respond to classic and immunosuppressive treatment for disease and developing invasive cardiac mucormycosis despite empiric treatment for febrile neutropenia.
