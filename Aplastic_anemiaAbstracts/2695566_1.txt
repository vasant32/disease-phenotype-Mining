Corticosteroids and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) have been extensively used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, aplastic anemia and organ graft rejection; nonetheless, the precise mechanisms of action of these agents are unknown. Studies of their long term immunoregulatory effects, particularly in humans, have been limited. We examined the long term effects of therapy with ATG given for 2-4 weeks and prednisone for 2 months in 4 patients with newly diagnosed insulin dependent diabetes (IDD). Three matched newly-diagnosed untreated IDD patients and 17 healthy volunteers served as controls. No differences in total lymphocyte count, percentage of B cells, percentage of total T cells (CD3), helper-inducer T cells (CD4) or cytotoxic-suppressor cells (CD8), lymphocyte blastogenesis assays, or pokeweed mitogen-induced IgG secretion in T & B cell co-cultures were detected before therapy. A transient lymphopenia following ATG administration was the only immunological defect found in the first month of therapy. At 2 months, however, patients treated with ATG and prednisone had diminished immunoregulatory T cell function demonstrated by production of only 28 +/- 3% IgG expected in T & B co-culture, compared to 205 +/- 35% for untreated IDD patients and 107 +/- 13% for normals (p less than 0.01). This diminished IgG production resulted from excessive suppressor function, since co-cultures of T cells from treated patients with T and B cells from normal volunteers suppressed the latter's IgG production by 76 +/- 9%. This enhanced suppressor activity persisted for 3-6 months following therapy. Other immunological functions were not statistically different from those present at the inception of the study. Thus, treatment with corticosteroids and ATG produces long-term enhanced suppressor activity, a finding which suggests that treatment with combination ATG and Prednisone is a rational form of immunomodulation in conditions associated with decreased suppressor function.
