To assess toxicity of D-penicillamine a retrospective chart review was performed on 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving penicillamine. These patients had a total of 83 courses of therapy. The mean age of patients was 52 years and the mean duration of disease was 10.07 years. Laboratory data showed an increase in hematocrit values from 36 per cent to 40 per cent and a decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate from an average of 50 to 29 mm/hour. The platelet count also decreased with treatment from 394,000 to 267,000/mm3. The over-all complication rate was 53 per cent. Life-threatening complications occurred in two patients including one case of aplastic anemia and one case of nephrotic syndrome. One additional patient was referred with aplastic anemia. Minor complications include rash in 18 per cent, loss of taste in 6 per cent, dyspepsia in 11 per cent, oral ulceration in 7 per cent and proteinuria of less than 3 g/day in 8 per cent. In summary, 53 per cent of the courses of penicillamine were associated with toxicity including one episode of aplastic anemia and one case of nephrotic syndrome. Therapy was stopped due to complications in 39 per cent of the patients in this series.
