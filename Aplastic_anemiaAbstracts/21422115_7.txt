 BACKGROUND: Although the therapeutic outcome of acquired aplastic anemia has improved markedly with the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy using antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, a significant proportion of patients subsequently relapse and require second-line therapy. However, detailed analyses of relapses in aplastic anemia children are limited. DESIGN AND METHODS: We previously conducted two prospective multicenter trials of immunosuppressive therapy for children with aplastic anemia: AA-92 and AA-97, which began in 1992 and 1997, respectively. In this study, we assessed the relapse rate, risk factors for relapse, and the response to second-line treatment in children with aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. RESULTS: From 1992 to 2007, we treated 441 children with aplastic anemia with standard immunosuppressive therapy. Among the 264 patients who responded to immunosuppressive therapy, 42 (15.9%) relapsed. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 11.9% at 10 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that relapse risk was significantly associated with an immunosuppressive therapy regimen using danazol (relative risk, 3.15; P=0.001) and non-severe aplastic anemia (relative risk, 2.51; P=0.02). Seventeen relapsed patients received additional immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. Eight patients responded within 6 months. Seven of nine non-responders to second immunosuppressive therapy received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and five are alive. Eleven patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation directly and seven are alive. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years was relatively low compared to that in other studies mainly involving adult patients. A multicenter prospective study is warranted to establish optimal therapy for children with aplastic anemia.
