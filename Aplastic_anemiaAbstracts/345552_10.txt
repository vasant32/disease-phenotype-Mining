Bone marrow transplantation using an HLA-MLC-identical sibling is the most valuable treatment of severe aplastic anemia.2,6,7 Between November 1973 and March 1977, 25 consecutive patients have been treated by marrow transplantation in our unit. Nine patients are alive with complete hematologic restoration between 3 months and 3 years. The high mortality can be largely accounted for by marrow graft rejection (14 patients). Despite the small number of patients, we have tried to identify prognostic factors associated with marrow graft rejection. They are mainly the existence of anti-HLA antibodies, the sex difference, and the normal PHA and MLC response before grafting. After the graft, the disappearance of anti-HLA antibodies has a good prognostic value. The appearance of autolymphocytotoxins seems to correlate strongly either with rejection or graft-versus-host disease.
