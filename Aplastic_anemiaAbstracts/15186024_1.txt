 PURPOSE: To report two cases of successful spouse pregnancies which were conceived with long-term cryopreserved spermatozoa that had been collected prior to the male patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. METHODS: The first case is the pregnant wife of a 25-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia, whose semen was collected before bone marrow transplant and then cryopreserved, thawed, and then injected into the wife's eggs via ICSI. The second case is a 28-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia who became a father after his wife's eggs were fertilized via ICSI with thawed spermatozoa. RESULTS: These two cases were achieved pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: These cases support research that men with malignancy have the chance of fathering their own genetic children. Therefore, it is important to increase the awareness of clinicians, oncologists, and patients to the new developments in preserving fertility for cancer patients.
