Human bone marrow was depleted of progenitors (CFU-MK), but enriched for recognizable megakaryocytes (MK), and placed in cultures with serum from either normal donors (NABS) or patients with primary (PTS) or secondary (STS) thrombocytosis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ATS) or aplastic anemia (AAS). Mean MK diameters shifted during the 3-4 days of incubation. Endomitotic figure were visible and mean ploidy increased slightly during cytoplasmic maturation, where decreases in immature cells (stages 1 and 2) were accompanied by increases in the mature MK (stages 3 and 4). Cytoplasmic maturation was faster in AAS, ATS and STS than PTS or NABS; mean size and ploidy were similar in all cultures. Recognizable MK were not forced to undergo additional endoreduplication in response to stimulation. Only AAS augmented MK colony formation, which indicated that at least two humoral factors can regulate megakaryocytopoiesis at separate levels, the progenitors and morphologically recognizable MK.
