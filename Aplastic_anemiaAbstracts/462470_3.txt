The frequency of common HLA-A and -B antigens were determined in 30 couples having a child with acute leukemia (AL), 34 couples having a child with aplastic anemia (AA) and 58 random couples with healthy children. An increased frequency of couples sharing at least two common antigens was observed in parents of both AL and AA children.
