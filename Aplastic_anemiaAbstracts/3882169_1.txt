Two patients with aplastic anemia were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and marrow transplantation from their normal, genetically identical twin. Both patients rapidly recovered normal marrow function, but marrow failure recurred 13 and 18 months later. Because donor and host pairs were identical twins, these cases of graft failure could not have resulted from the usual cause of graft failure, ie, immunological reactivity of host cells against unshared minor histocompatibility antigens of the donor. These results imply that there are at least two mechanisms responsible for graft failure after marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia.
