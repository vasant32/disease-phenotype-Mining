Investigation of the kinetics of blood platelets is of paramount importance in cases where it is necessary to differentiate the cause of thrombocytopenia in patients: reduction of the output, changes in organ distribution or increase of sequestration of blood platelets. Using the method of labeling own blood platelets and a gamma-chamber, the kinetics of blood platelets (organ distribution, recovery and survival) was studied and computed in 40 patients with hypoplastic anemia, hypersplenism and thrombocytopenic purpura. A complex of the parameters characterizing the given disease has been defined.
