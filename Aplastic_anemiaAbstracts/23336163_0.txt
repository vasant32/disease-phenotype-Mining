 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of telomerase RNA component (hTERC) and the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) with telomerase activity in the marrow hemopoietic stem cells of children with aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: Fifty-two children with chronic AA, 13 children with acute AA and 21 normal controls were enrolled in the study. Telomerase activity and the expression of mRNA of hTERT and hTERC were detected by Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) with silver staining and real-time Q-PCR respectively. RESULTS: Levels of telomerase activity in both the chronic and acute AA groups were higher than in the control group (P<0.01). The AA groups had significantly higher expression of hTERT mRNA than the control group (P<0.01). The chronic AA group had higher expression of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity than the acute AA group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of hTERC mRNA among the three groups (P=0.812). There was a significant correlation between the expression of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (r=0.660, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of telomerase activity may be involved in the pathophysiology and development of AA, and hTERT plays a crucial role in expression of telomerase activity.
