OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report was to study the contrast enhancement of reactive hematopoietic regions in bone marrow on Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) enhanced MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the contrast enhancement of reactive hematopoietic regions in the marrow of patients with aplastic anemia and drug-induced pancytopenia and that of normal bone marrow on Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI. RESULTS: The reactive hematopoietic marrow observed in aplastic anemia of moderate grade and drug-induced pancytopenia markedly enhanced after Gd-DTPA administration; normoplastic marrow showed no enhancement. CONCLUSION: Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI was useful in detecting the reactive hematopoietic regions in bone marrow.
