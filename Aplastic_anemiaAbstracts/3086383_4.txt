We produced an antiserum by immunizing rabbits with purified human megakaryocyte colony stimulating factor (Meg-CSF). With the use of an anti-Meg-CSF IgG fraction (AM-IgG), we detected immunoreactive Meg-CSF both in human aplastic anemia serum (AAS) and normal serum. Based on our immunological and biological analyses, Meg-CSF appeared to be antigenically as well as functionally distinct from human urinary erythropoietin (EPO) and thrombopoietic stimulating factor. The AM-IgG fraction was able to suppress the ability of both aplastic anemia serum and purified Meg-CSF to promote megakaryocyte colony formation. In addition, the supernatant formed after immune precipitation of the AAS with AM-IgG no longer possessed Meg-CSF-like activity. The AM-IgG did not suppress the ability of EPO, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte conditioned medium (PHA-LCM), or PHA-LCM + EPO to promote erythroid, granulocyte-macrophage, or mixed colony formation, respectively. The use of this antibody has further defined the dependency of human megakaryocytopoiesis on Meg-CSF.
