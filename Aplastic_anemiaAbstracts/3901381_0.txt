Cell-mediated immunity was studied in 11 patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia according to several parameters at a time. Analysis of the data obtained draws attention to the pronounced relative lymphocytosis, disordered balance of the immunoregulatory subpopulations of T lymphocytes (T mu and T gamma) associated with an appreciable increase in the number of cytotoxic T suppressor cells. The lowering of spontaneous and optimal Con A dose-induced production of leukocyte migration inhibition factor and deficiency of the activity of normal killers can be determined by potentiation of the suppressor activity of T lymphocytes or by the influence of factors produced by T suppressors. The goal-oriented correction of the high suppressor activity of T cells may appear promising in the complex of therapeutic measures used in the management of the patients' population with idiopathic aplastic anemia.
