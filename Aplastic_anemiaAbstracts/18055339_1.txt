We experienced a case of danazol-induced splenic peliosis. A 42-year-old woman had taken danazol for refractory aplastic anemia for 2 years. Her anemia gradually became aggravated, and the patient complained of intermittent left upper-abdominal pain. Because computed tomography scanning showed multiple blood-filled cavities in the enlarged spleen without intraperitoneal hemorrhage, a splenectomy was emergently performed. This report is the first of a case of splenic peliosis developing during danazol therapy for aplastic anemia. The possible association between the administration of anabolic steroids or danazol and the development of peliosis is discussed.
