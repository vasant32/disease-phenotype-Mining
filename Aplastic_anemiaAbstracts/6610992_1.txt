This article describes the treatment of two patients with severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) by means of high-dose methylprednisolone ( HDMP ) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). A complete normalization of the haematological data was obtained in one patient, which has persisted now for 10 months. ATG and HDMP seem to provide an alternative mode of treatment of SAA to bone marrow transplantation if there is no histocompatible bone marrow donor available.
