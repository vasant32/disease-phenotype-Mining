 BACKGROUND: Bone marrow has been shown to be superior to peripheral blood, as a stem cell source, in young patients (<20 years of age) with acquired aplastic anemia undergoing a matched sibling transplant. The aim of this study was to test whether this currently also holds true for older patients with acquired aplastic anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 1886 patients with acquired aplastic anemia who received a first transplant from a human leukocyte antigen identical sibling between 1999 and 2009, with either bone marrow (n=1163) or peripheral blood (n=723) as the source of stem cells. RESULTS: In multivariate Cox analysis negative predictors for survival were: patient's age over 20 years (RR 2.0, P<0.0001), an interval between diagnosis and transplantation of more than 114 days (RR 1.3, P=0.006), no anti-thymocyte globulin in the conditioning (RR 1.6, P=0.0001), a conditioning regimen other than cyclophosphamide (RR=1.3, P=0.008) and the use of peripheral blood as the source of stem cells (RR 1.6, P<0.00001). The survival advantage for recipients of bone marrow rather than peripheral blood was statistically significant in patients aged 1-19 years (90% versus 76% P<0.00001) as well as in patients aged over 20 years (74% versus 64%, P=0.001). The advantage for recipients of bone marrow over peripheral blood was maintained above the age of 50 years (69% versus 39%, P=0.01). Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were more frequent in peripheral blood transplants. Major causes of death were graft-versus-host disease (2% versus 6% in bone marrow and peripheral blood recipients, respectively), infections (6% versus 13%), and graft rejection (1.5% versus 2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that bone marrow should be the preferred stem cell source for matched sibling transplants in acquired aplastic anemia, in patients of all age groups.
