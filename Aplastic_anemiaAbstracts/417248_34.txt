Prophylaxis by granulocyte transfusions against infection associated with granulocytopenia was studied in 69 patients receiving bone-marrow transplants for the therapy of hematologic neoplasia or aplastic anemia. Patients were randomized to receive or not to receive granulocyte transfusions when their circulating granulocyte levels fell to less than 200 per cubic millimeter during the period between transplantation and the development of graft function. During the first 21 posttransplant days, there were two local infections and no septicemias in 29 transfused patients. Seven local infections and 10 septicemias developed among the 40 controls. This protection was afforded by granulocytes collected by reversible leukoadhesion as well as by cells collected by continuous-flow centrifugation.
