OBJECTIVE: To explore factors influencing the effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy in severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: The serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) of 22 SAA patients and 15 normal controls were measured by immunoenzyme assay. RESULTS: Comparing with the normal controls, 40.9% and 63.6% of the SAA patients had higher serum levels of IL-2 (>840ng/L) and of sIL 2R (>320 x 10(3) U/L), respectively. Those who had higher IL-2 levels and higher sIL-2R levels got better responses to cyclosporin A(CsA) and CsA plus antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). CONCLUSION: The serum levels of IL-2 and sIL-2R were correlated with the responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy in SAA patients and might be useful for directing treatment.
