The clinical and pathological findings of peliosis hepatis are reported, complicating a long-term treatment with an anabolic steroid in a 19 year old male patient suffering from chronic aplastic anemia. Following a 15 months course of oxymetholone (Anapolon) a cholestatic jaundice developed without regression despite discontinuing the drug. 4 months later the patient expired as a consequence of his hematologic disease. At autopsy the liver showed a parenchymal type of peliosis hepatis with multiple blood filled cavities and focal liver cell necroses. The pathogenesis of this rare condition is discussed by means of literature demonstrating the hepatotoxic effect of C17-alkylated androgens.
