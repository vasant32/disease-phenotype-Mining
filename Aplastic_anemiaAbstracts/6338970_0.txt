The present study in patients with aplastic anemia was undertaken to determine whether exposure of recipients to donor blood products 24 hr before preparation with cyclophosphamide (1) enhanced the rate of sustained engraftment of marrow from HLA-identical siblings as suggested by animal experiments, (2) increased the rejection rate, in particular in transfused patients who may already have been exposed to donor antigens by blood products, or (3) was of no relevance to the outcome of transplantation of marrow from HLA-identical siblings. One-hundred fifty-five patients were studied, of whom 78 received blood products from the marrow donor 24 hr before cyclophosphamide and 77 did not. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to the data, simultaneously considering five previously known risk factors for rejection. Results showed that preceding transfusion of donor blood products had neither a significant beneficial nor detrimental effect on the incidence of sustained engraftment.
