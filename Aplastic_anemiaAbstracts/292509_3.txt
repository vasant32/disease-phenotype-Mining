Three patients with drug-induced hypoplastic anemia terminating 2 to 6 years after presentation with erythroleukemia are described. All were treated for prolonged periods with androgen and corticosteroid and two of the patients showed apparent dependence on this therapy for optimal hematologic status. The leukemic phase was heralded by loss of this dependence and development of sideroblastic dyserythropoiesis with progression to bizarre erythroid hyperplasia and fatal cytopenia. The exact relationship between androgen and corticosteroid therapy and the erythroleukemia remains speculative.
