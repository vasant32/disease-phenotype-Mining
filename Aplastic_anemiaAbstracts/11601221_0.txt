OBJECTIVE: To explore more effective regimen for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the outcome of SAA patients treated with the combination of antilymphocyte globulin(ALG) and cyclosporine A(CsA) (intensive immunosuppressive therapy, IIST) was better than that with ALG alone (non-intensive immunosuppressive therapy, NIIST). RESULTS: The response rate of IIST group(83.7%) was significantly higher than that of NIIST group(57.6%), with a lower risk of early mortality and a shorter time to red cell transfusion independence. Furthermore, the recovery of bone marrow BFU-E and CFU-GM of the responding patients was more complete in IIST group than in NIIST group. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment outcome was better with IIST than with NIIST for SAA.
