The treatment of 77 children suffering from acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) in the Petersburg Pediatric Hematological Center allowed the authors to distinguish three groups of patients according to the disease severity: severe, moderate and mild. The groups differed by clinicohematological parameters and treatment results. With reference to the above classification conventional combined treatment with hormones and splenectomy is uneffective in groups 1 and 2, but is able to induce remission in half the patients with mild disease. Immunosuppression with antilymphocytic globulin and large-dose methylprednisolone markedly contributed to survival prolongation in severe and moderate AAA (69 and 90% of cases with long-term remissions, respectively), being a failure in group 1 patients who are primarily scheduled for bone marrow transplantation.
