 OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of routine laboratory parameters in diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and differential diagnosis of patients with hypoplastic MDS from chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) for providing reference standard for primary hospitals. METHODS: The laboratory parameters at diagnosis of 152 MDS patients with less than 0.05 bone marrow blasts and 86 CAA patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were significant differences between MDS and CAA in Hb, red cell distribution width-coefficient variation (RDW-CV), immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), BPC, the ratio of G1 (the sum percentage of myeloblast and promyelocyte) to G2 (the sum percentage of neutrophilic myelocyte and metamyelocyte) (Ratio G), the ratio of El (the sum percentage of proerythroblast and early erythroblast) to E2 (the sum percentage of intermediate erythroblast and late erythroblast) (Ratio E), megakaryocyte count (Meg), erythroblast PAS, neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (N-ALP), and serous levels of indirect bilirubin (IBIL), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), folic acid (FA), VitB12 and ferritin. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 74 MDS patients (48.7%) but in none of CAA patients (P < 0.001). Furthermore, for differentiating MDS with less than 0.05 blasts from CAA, the sensitivity and specificity of combination of Meg, PAS, and IBIL level was 89.1% and 92.7%, the Youden index (gamma) was 0.818. Moreover, in the seven hypoplastic MDS cases, BPC, myeloblast percentage, Ratio G, Meg, erythroblast PAS and FA were statistically different from those of CAA; the sensitivity and specificity of combination of PAS and BPC was 85.7% and 100%, the gamma was 0.857; the sensitivity and specificity combination of Ratio G, Meg PAS was 85.7% and 98.8% respectively, the gamma was 0.845. CONCLUSION: The routine laboratory parameters, especially BPC, Meg, Ratio G, PAS, IBIL may be helpful for the diagnosis of MDS and differential diagnosis of hypoplastic MDS from CAA.
