Two rare cases of aplastic anemia after prolonged ingestion of indomethacin are described. One patient recovered spontaneously within several weeks following discontinuation of the drug while the second one died. The aplastic anemia may be related to the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides which have a regulatory role in erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis.
