Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare rheumatic condition characterized by inflammatory thickening of the skin and fascia, peripheral eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hypergammaglobulinemia. Internal organ involvement is uncommon. It is often difficult to diagnose eosinophilic fasciitis and its course may be variable. Glucocorticoids are most commonly used in the treatment but in many cases they are ineffective, requiring combined immunosuppressive treatment. Several cases of eosinophilic fasciitis and serious haematological disorders such as immune thrombocytopenia, Hodgkin's disease and aplastic anaemia have been described. The authors report an atypical severe case of eosinophilic fasciitis complicated by aplastic anaemia non responsive to treatment.
