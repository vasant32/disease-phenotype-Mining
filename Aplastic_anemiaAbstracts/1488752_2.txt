For treatment of steroid-resistant severe graft-versus-host disease, a murine monoclonal antibody (25.3) against the alpha chain (CD11a) of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) was infused into a patient with posthepatitic aplastic anemia who had undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The monoclonal antibody infusion was well tolerated and resulted in appreciable improvement in symptoms of gastrointestinal illness such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, suggesting that this antibody may be useful for controlling severe acute graft-versus-host disease.
