Severe aplastic anemia has been reported in children following Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The pathophysiology of disease is not known, but an immunologic mechanism is suspected because of the rapid response to steroids. A patient with severe aplastic anemia following EBV infection experienced bone marrow recovery after treatment with high-dose prednisone. After reviewing the literature it is concluded that steroid therapy is indicated in this select group of patients.
