A 27-year-old female was diagnosed as having atypical aplastic anemia in 1979 because of hypercellular bone marrow with abnormal erythroblasts and megakaryocytes. Afterward the diagnosis was corrected to myelodysplastic syndrome (RA) due to the reevaluation of the bone marrow smears. In March, 1995, thirst and polyurea occurred. In April, 1995, bone marrow aspiration biopsy showed the proliferation of atypical blasts (28%), and two months later, the number of the blasts increased (30%) and leukemic progression was noticed. Only 0.5 percent of the blasts showed weak peroxidase activity, and most of the blasts had CD13, CD33 and several adhesion molecules as CD11a, CD11b, CD44, CD54 and CD56. Karyotype of the bone marrow cells was 45, XX, -7. Her polyurea was caused by central diabetes insipidus. She was also complicated by pleuritis, colon ulcer, sinusitis and hypothalamic dysfunction. The etiology of these signs was due to the leukemic cell infiltration. She died despite of receiving multi-drug chemotherapy.
