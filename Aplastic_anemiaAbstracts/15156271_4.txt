This case report highlights the emergence of new complications associated with old procedures as the frequency of their use increases. A 29-year-old man with aplastic anemia was admitted for a bone marrow transplant. Before this procedure, a Hickman line was inserted. This was followed by hoarseness of voice. An examination revealed an immobile left vocal cord. Further investigations did not show any cause for this complication. Therefore, the hoarseness and vocal cord paralysis was attributed to trauma associated with the insertion of the Hickman line.
