Hepatocellular adenoma is a rare benign tumor of the liver. However, some complications, such as hemorrhage, rupture, and malignant transformation, have been reported previously. Surgical resection is considered to be the best choice of treatment, when adenomas are increasing in size, while resection is difficult to perform when multiple adenomas develop throughout the liver. Here, we report two cases of multiple hepatocellular adenomatosis. One patient had a history of aplastic anemia and the other had glycogen storage disease. We treated them with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) to prevent hemorrhage and rupture. After TAE, most parts of the adenomas showed necrotic change. These cases suggest that TAE is an effective treatment of hepatocellular adenomatosis.
