OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Digan oral liquid (DGOL) on cell proliferation cycle of thymic lymphocyte in immune mediated aplastic anemia (IMAA) in mice. METHODS: Balb/c mice were used in the experiment, after having exposed under a sublethal amount of radiation, the mice were received injection of mixed cells of thymus and lymph node of DBA/2 mice to form the IMAA models. The model mice were grouped and treated, then their thymus was taken to prepare the single cell suspension for analysis by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Majority of thymocyte of IMAA mice stopped at the G0/G1 phase, and the cells in S and G2 + M phases were significantly less than those in the normal control group, P < 0.01. Both DGOL and Siwu oral liquid could increase the differentiation and proliferation of thymocytes and reduce the apoptosis rate of them, but DGOL showed a better effect, P < 0.05. CONCLUSION: DGOL could significantly promote the differentiation and proliferation of thymocytes and reduce the apoptosis rate of them in IMAA mice, the effect of its is superior to that of Siwu oral liquid.
