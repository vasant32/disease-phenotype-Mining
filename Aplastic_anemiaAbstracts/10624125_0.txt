We evaluated measurements of PAIgG, reticulated platelets (RP), plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels, and platelet size to determine whether these parameters were useful for the differential diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), aplastic anemia (AA), and hypoplastic thrombocytopenia (HypoT). The percentage of RP (%RP) in patients with ITP was significantly higher (25.2 +/- 11.0%, P < 0.001) than in normal subjects (7.9 +/- 2.8), and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of %RP in diagnosing ITP were 82%, 95%, 96%, respectively. On the other hand, TPO levels in patients with AA and HypoT were significantly higher (355.5 +/- 218.7 pg/ml, P < 0.001, and 376.4 +/- 347.2, P < 0.001, respectively) than in normal subjects (36.7 +/- 23.0). The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of TPO in diagnosing AA and HypoT were 88%, 89% and 86%, respectively. We also sought to determine whether the simultaneous measurement of %RP and TPO improved their value in the differential diagnosis of ITP, AA, and HypoT. However, simultaneous measurement did not yield significant improvements in sensitivty, specificity, or predictive value. These results indicated that measurements of %RP will suffice for the diagnosis of ITP, and that measurements of TPO are adequate for the diagnosis of AA and HypoT.
