Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia was systematically studied in 56 patients having undergone bone marrow transplantation for leukemia or aplastic anemia. Of the patients who survived at least three months, 57% had CMV viremia with a frequency peak between the 7th and the 9th weeks. We describe possible clinical signs associated with viremia, particularly late peripheral and/or central thrombocytopenia. The occurrence of viremia was studied according to the specific preexisting immune status of recipients and donors; granulocyte transfusions and graft-versus-host disease. The relationship between these parameters and viremia provides a basis for the analysis of prophylactic treatments of CMV infection.
