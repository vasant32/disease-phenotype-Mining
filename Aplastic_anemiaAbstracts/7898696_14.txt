A 53-year-old woman began taking felbamate for uncontrolled complex partial seizures. Four months later, she developed fatigue and ecchymotic skin lesions. Laboratory studies revealed very severe aplastic anemia. There have been an additional nine reported cases of aplastic anemia in the setting of felbamate treatment. The association between felbamate and aplastic anemia has resulted in a joint recommendation by the US Food and Drug Administration and the manufacturer of felbamate, Carter-Wallace, Inc., for the immediate withdrawal of patients from treatment with felbamate.
