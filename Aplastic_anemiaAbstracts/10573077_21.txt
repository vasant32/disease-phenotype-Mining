Successful engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells requires a supportive hematopoietic stromal microenvironment (HSM). Defects in the HSM associated with aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, or caused by intensive ionizing radiation and chemotherapy generally result in failure of bone marrow (BM) engraftment. Transplantation of donor BM within donor HSM may therefore provide optimal conditions for allogeneic BM transplantation. We have transplanted donor hematopoietic cells together with their own HSM to improve acceptance of allogeneic or xenogeneic BM. The non-myeloablative treatment used induced tolerance to murine allografts and provided conditions for the life-long acceptance of allogeneic HSM. Allogeneic BM transplanted within it's own HSM under the kidney capsule caused less graft-versus-host disease than BM transplanted i.v. Tolerance in mice to xenogeneic (rat) HSM was less complete. Ectopic ossicles were small and contained fewer hematopoietic cells. However, simultaneous transplantation of rat BM and HSM to preconditioned mice improved engraftment of rat BM compared with transplantation of BM alone. Donor hematopoietic cells survived longer on their own HSM than on HSM of recipients.
