Since 1989 we have been collecting dry-platelets on a routine basis. Dry-platelets are those collected along with 25-30 ml of contaminating plasma cell with separators such as the Amicus, AS 104 and the Excel Pro. Platelets are resuspended in non plasma media for storage and for at least 60 hours their viability and functionality are not impaired. In this article we report on two hemolytic crises determined by two O Rh D + units of single donor platelets (SPD) taken from the same donor in a double-apheresis session. The two split units were administered to two A Rh D + patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) respectively. In both cases the hemolytic reaction was of the intravascular type, with a drop in hemoglobin (Hgb) level from 8.6 to 5.4 and from 8.8 down to 5.3 g/dl respectively. From the patients' RBC only alpha agglutinins were eluted and donor's indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was negative with extended panel RBCs. In the first case the clinical course after erythroexchange (Erex) was uneventful whereas in the second one, that suffering from SAA, after Erex, acute renal failure and shock did complicate the clinical course and the patient died seven days after the incriminated platelet transfusion.
