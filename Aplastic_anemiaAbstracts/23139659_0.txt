Th17 cells, characterized by IL-17 production, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune bullous disorders and aplastic anemia (AA). In this report, we describe a 58-year-old Japanese man with bullous pemphigoid (BP) accompanied by AA. Interestingly, immunohistochemical staining revealed the existence of IL-17-producing cells in the skin biopsy specimens from BP. Our findings might suggest relationships between IL-17 and the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases, and, to our knowledge, this is the first English report of BP accompanied by AA.
