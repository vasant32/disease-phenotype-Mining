We surveyed cases of severe aplastic anemia treated by bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical siblings according to information collected from 21 medical facilities throughout Japan. Twenty-nine patients have been given bone marrow transplants since 1977. Fifteen patients had survived for 20 to 2,485 days after bone marrow transplantation as of November 30, 1983. The one-year survival rate was 60% and the two-year survival rate was 44%. The incidence of rejection was 37% in patients with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Various regimens have been used for conditioning for bone marrow transplantation.
