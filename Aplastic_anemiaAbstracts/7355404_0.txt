Eleven patients with malignant lymphoma were treated with total body irradiation. This therapy was performed during 3 weeks with a midline dose of 70 to 100 rd. Two patients were treated two times after an internal of 3 months. The authors studied the hematologic side effects of this therapy. The irradiation caused a diminution of leucocytes of 73% of the initial value (range 16,7 to 98,4%), the neutrophilic granulocytes were reduced by 60% (24-95%), the thrombocytes were reduced by 57% (12-73%). The lowest values were seen during the fourth and sixth week of observation or one to three weeks after the end of therapy. In patients with hypoplastic anemia the number of reticulocytes was reduced to zero with a further fall of hematocrit and replacement therapy was necessary. The pool of circulating CFUc was reduced to zero in nine of twelve observations up to six weeks after therapy.
