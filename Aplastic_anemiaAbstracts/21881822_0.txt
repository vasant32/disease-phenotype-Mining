CD4(+) T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Tcf-1 gene regulates T cell development and function, and it is significantly upregulated in the bone marrow CD4(+) T cells from patients with acquired AA. To explore the role of Tcf-1 in the pathogenesis of AA, we knocked down Tcf-1 gene in CD4(+) T cells of AA patients and studied the effects of Tcf-1 silencing on its downstream gene expression. Upon transfection of psiRNA into marrow CD4(+) T cells from bone marrow of aplastic anemia patients, the expression of Tcf-1 was significantly knocked down; consequently, expressions of c-Myc and CD44 were also significantly reduced. Our results suggest that Tcf-1 may contribute to pathogenesis of AA by regulating downstream gene expression such as c-myc and CD44.
