OBJECTIVE: To explore the immunophenotype of myeloid cells in myelodysplastic syndyomes (MDS) and its clinical implications. METHODS: A panel of monoclonal antibody was used to detect CD13+, CD33+, CD15+ and CD14+ antigens on the membrane surfaces of myeloid cells in the bone marrow from 51 MDS, 21 aplastic anemia (AA), 21 paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients. 10 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients and 15 normal subjects by immunoenzymatic assay. The morphology and chromosome karyotype of bone marrow cells of MDS patients were also examined. RESULTS: CD14+, CD13+ and CD33+ cells in the bone marrow were more in MDS patients than in normal controls, AA patients and PNH patients. CD15+ cells in the bone marrow were less in MDS patients than in normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of CD14+, CD13+ and CD33+ positive cells in the bone marrow of MDS patients were related to the percentage of myeloblasts, the chromosomal aberrations and the response to treatment. It indicated that there is immunophenotypic misexpression of myeloid cells in MDS patients. Immunophenotype analysis of myeloid cells might be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of MDS patients.
