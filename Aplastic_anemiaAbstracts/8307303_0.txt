Signs of hypoplastic anemia in experimental hymenolepiasis become manifest when immature cestodes develop and gain severity at the stage of mature cestodes. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils acquires an undulating pattern. Dehelminthization of mice with fenasal (1000 mg/kg/day) or asinox (75 mg/kg, daily) made hypoplastic processes in the bone marrow reversible and precluded routine undulation of phagocytosis.
