Between 1998 and 2001, 31 (24 male, 7 female) patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and a median age of 19 years (range, 4-39 years) received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Marrow donors were genotypically HLA-identical siblings in 30 cases and a monozygous twin in one case. The median time from diagnosis to bone marrow transplantation was 1 month (range, 0.5-5 months). Conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), in all patients. For graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, all patients received methotrexate and cyclosporin. A total of 84% of patients had sustained grafts, whereas 16% rejected grafts between 3 and 20 months after transplantation. Of the five rejecting patients, three are alive with successful second engraftments and two died from infections. Acute grade II-IV GvHD was seen in only 11% of patients. A limited chronic GvHD was seen in one patient. With a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 5-42 months), survival rate was 86% and Karnofsky score was at least 90%. This study confirms the high success rate of the CY/ATG regimen in SAA allografted from an HLA-identical sibling. Early and late graft failure remains a problem and may require modification of this regimen.
