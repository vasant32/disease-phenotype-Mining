Although cyclosporine (CsA) is a key drug in the treatment of acquired aplastic anemia (AA), the role of single-agent therapy with CsA remains unclear. To determine the efficacy of CsA in the treatment of AA, we treated 38 AA patients with CsA alone and followed up the patients for 6 months to 16 years. Twenty patients (53%) achieved either a partial or complete remission within 1 year of starting CsA therapy. Thirteen (81%) of 16 patients who showed an increase in the reticulocyte count of >20 x 10(9)/L within 2 months achieved remission, whereas the response rate was only 32% in patients who failed to show such an increase in the reticulocyte count. The actuarial overall survival and failure-free survival rates at 5 years were 91% and 37%, respectively. These data indicate that CsA alone can achieve a sustained remission in approximately 40% of AA patients, with a low probability of inducing secondary clonal diseases. Given its low toxicity and because the effectiveness of CsA can be judged within 2 months of therapy, CsA may be the first drug of choice at outpatient clinics for AA patients not requiring transfusions.
