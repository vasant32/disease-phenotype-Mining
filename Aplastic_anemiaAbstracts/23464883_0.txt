Over 400 cases of pediatric SAA occur annually in the United States. A growing number of children with SAA may have had their stem cells harvested through cord blood collection. We describe a nine-yr-old male with SAA treated successfully with an autologous cord blood transplant following immunoablative chemotherapy. With the increasing number of people cryopreserving autologous cord blood, the use of autologous cord blood in the treatment of SAA might be considered as initial therapy. This case serves to discuss approaches to preparative therapy as well as the potential complications in this growing cohort of patients.
