A 28-year-old man developed cryptogenic hepatitis in January 1999, and treatment with glycyrrhizic acid improved his liver function. From June, however, pancytopenia began to develop gradually. The patient received G-CSF against leukocytopenia (WBC 1,100/microliter, neutrophils 590/microliter) and was transferred to our hospital in August 1999. A diagnosis of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia was made on the basis of liver dysfunction (AST 156 IU/l, ALT 386 IU/l), hypoplastic bone marrow, and pancytopenia (WBC 4,400/microliter, neutrophils 3,340/microliter under G-CSF administration, Hb 9.8 g/dl, platelets 2.4 x 10(4)/microliter, reticulocytes 4.7 x 10(4)/microliter). Immediately after starting combined therapy with ATG, cyclosporin, and G-CSF, his liver function began to improve and was normalized on day 7. Pancytopenia began to ameliorate on day 9, and blood parameters on day 60 were WBC 4,200/microliter (without G-CSF administration), Hb 12.0 g/dl, platelets 9.0 x 10(4)/microliter, and reticulocytes 4.1 x 10(4)/microliter. Although the prognosis of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is generally poor, immunosuppressive therapy was markedly effective for both pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction in the present case.
