The human immune system has evolved multiple cellular and humoral defense mechanisms against the lymphotropic virus, EBV. NK cells, suppressor T-cells, cytotoxic K-cells, memory T-cells, and humoral immune responses usually subdue the virus into latency. Individuals with immune deficiency are at great risk of developing immunoregulatory disturbances and lymphoproliferative diseases when confronted by EBV. The infection of B-cells by EBV provokes a marked activation of immunoregulatory T-cells and requires restoration of immune homeostasis during convalescence. This is accomplished with difficulty in an individual with significant immune defects. The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an exemplary model for studying EBV in immune deficient individuals. Boys with XLP can develop acquired agammaglobulinemia, aplastic anemia, chronic or fatal IM, and a variety of B-cell malignant lymphomas following infection by the virus. We have identified multiple immune defects in the patients and progressive immunoregulatory disturbances following infection by the virus. Other patients with immune deficiency syndromes, i.e., ataxia telangiectasia or the renal transplant recipient, are also at increased risk for developing EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases. Moreover, certain families are at increased risk for EBV-associated malignancies, especially those with a triad of manifestations (i.e., autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and lymphoma). Chromosomal breakage as seen in patients with ataxia telangiectasia may predispose to leukemogenesis. Immunoregulatory defects are also probably predisposing factors to lymphomagenesis. Both inherited and acquired defects can render persons vulnerable to leukemia and lymphoma.
