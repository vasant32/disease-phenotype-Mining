Occasionally it is difficult to differentiate paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) from idiopathic aplastic anemia in patients who present with pancytopenia and an aplastic bone marrow. Patients with PNH may not have an abnormal acid hemolysis test, and patients with aplastic anemia may present with evidence of abnormal sucrose lysis, acid hemolysis, and antibody-mediated complement hemolysis. Demonstration of a population of red blood cells which are highly susceptible to antibody-mediated complement lysis makes a diagnosis of PNH probable. Donor red blood cell survival studies, which distinguish intracorpuscular from extracorpuscular hemolytic disorders, permit differentiation of the two disorders.
