Forty-three cases of aplastic anemia were treated with fetal blood transfusion, Chinese medicinal herbs and Vit. C. The results showed that the effective rate of the treated group was 79.1%, among them, the chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) was 88.9%, acute aplastic anemia (AAA) was 62.5%, both rates were higher than that of the control group (with western medicine alone, n = 46). The difference of treatment results between two groups was highly significant. The mechanism was that the therapy could rebuild hematopoietic function, modulate immune function and improve microcosmic environment in bone marrow so that it promoted in all aspect the recovery of hematopoietic function in organism.
