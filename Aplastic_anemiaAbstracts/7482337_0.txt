The authors present 5-year survival of 64 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) divided into 2 groups. Group 1 received antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) in low doses (1-5 mg/kg), group 2 in high doses (10-30 mg/kg). Survival of patients with severe AA in group 1 made up 28.5%, with mild AA 90.1%. Overall survival in group 1 was 64.4%, in group 2 53.8%. Overall toxicity came to 48.6%. By resultant complications high and low ALG doses did not differ. The authors propose to use low doses of ALG in mild disease whereas in severe condition high ALG doses are thought adequate.
