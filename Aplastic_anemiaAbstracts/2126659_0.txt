Bone marrow transplant was performed in a child with posthepatic aplastic anemia complicated by alopecia totalis. The procedure was successful, as the graft was apparently "taken" by the recipient and hair started to grow on the head. The hair has not been lost since, and is still growing as of the date of this report. Although nonA nonB hepatitis virus was found to be the cause of hepatitis in this patient, the reason for the alopecia totalis which developed 7 years previously is unclear. The postoperative growth of the hair was attributed to restoration of normal immunologic function through bone marrow transplant.
