Changes in hemostatic factors after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), with or without thrombotic complications, have already been described. The endothelium seems to be actively involved in such processes. Over a period of 2 years we evaluated various hemostatic factors, associated or not with endothelial stimulation, in 44 patients with BMT (40 leukemias and 4 aplastic anemias). Factor VIII activity (VIII:C), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI-1), antithrombin III, protein C and protein S were assayed before and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after BMT. Factor VIII:C, vWF and tPA were found to be significantly increased 1-6 months after BMT, returning to normal later. Patients with acute graft versus host disease, fever or cyclosporin treatment had significantly higher VIII:C, vWF and tPA. The increase in these factors implies lasting stimulation of their release and/or synthesis from endothelial cells that is enhanced by some complications of BMT. The degree and character of these changes could favor activation of thrombotic processes.
