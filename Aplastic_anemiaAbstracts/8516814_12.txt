BACKGROUND: The significance of hepatitis C in kidney transplant recipients is unclear. The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C among candidates for transplantation is up to 50% in some centers. METHODS: We screened 640 frozen serum samples obtained pretransplantation from all kidney recipients at the Medical College of Wisconsin between January 1979 and March 1990 for antibody to hepatitis C using the second generation immunoassay. Charts were reviewed from all hepatitis C antibody-positive (anti-HCV+) patients and 256 randomly chosen hepatitis C antibody negative (anti-HCV-) controls. Actuarial patient and graft survival in these two groups were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-HCV was 8.3%. Blacks and i.v. drug users were disproportionately represented in the anti-HCV+ group. Of the anti-HCV+ patients, 18.9% developed chronic hepatitis independent of race. Black anti-HCV+ patients had a 5-year graft survival of 28 +/- 11% compared to 67 +/- 7% in black anti-HCV- patients (P = 0.003). Black anti-HCV-, white anti-HCV-, and white anti-HCV+ patients all had similar graft survival. Anti-HCV was not a poor prognostic indicator for overall patient survival or the development of aplastic anemia and malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HCV is a significant risk factor for reduced kidney graft survival in blacks apart from i.v. drug abuse. Black anti-HCV- patients had graft survival similar to white transplant recipients, indicating that anti-HCV may be one marker for the poorer graft survival in blacks that has been observed in most transplant programs. Anti-HCV in kidney transplant recipients increases the risk for the development of chronic hepatitis post-transplant.
