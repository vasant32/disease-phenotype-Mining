Thymus humoral factor-gamma 2 (THF gamma 2), an octapeptide important for T-lymphocyte regulation, was assessed for its effect on the in vitro growth of human hematopoietic progenitor cells. This was achieved using a recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF)-stimulated myeloid cell colony formation (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, GM-CFC) assay as well as a recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo)-stimulated erythroid burst formation (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) assay. Cells were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of normal healthy donors and from patients with suppressed bone marrows. The latter group included aplastic anemia, leukemia, and lymphoma patients and patients with solid tumors who responded to intensive chemotherapy with significant pancytopenia. THF gamma 2 significantly enhanced normal BM and PB GM-CFC and PB BFU-E by 2- to 2.5-fold. This effect was totally dependent on the presence of the respective growth factors, that is, rGM-CSF or rEpo, and was specifically reversed by an anti-THF gamma 2 antiserum. Furthermore, although THF gamma 2-induced enhancement of GM-CFC colony formation was not affected by lymphocyte or monocyte depletion, the augmenting effect of the peptide on BFU-E was completely abrogated in the absence of lymphocytes. THF gamma 2-induced augmented growth of progenitor cells derived from severely suppressed marrows was minimal. However, cells from moderately neutropenic patients with leukemia in remission or with lymphoma under chemotherapy responded to the peptide similarly to cells from normal donors. These results suggest a stimulatory role for THF gamma 2 on human myeloid and erythroid hematopoietic progenitor cells. They also suggest the lymphocyte dependence of BFU-E enhancement and lymphocyte independence of GM-CFC stimulation by THF gamma 2. In the former case the thymus-derived peptide may act through the induction of certain erythroid-enhancing lymphokines.
