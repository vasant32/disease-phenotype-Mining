Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a very rare inherited disorder characterized by skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and mucosal leukoplakia. It is also associated with a variety of noncutaneous abnormalities, such as fatal pulmonary complications, malignancy, and bone marrow failure. We report the case of a 32-year-old man with DC associated with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The traditional treatment of DC-associated SAA is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, in this case, an HLA-matched donor was not available. Therefore our patient was given intensive immunosuppressive therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and cyclosporine A (CsA). The hemogram findings improved after the treatment, but the patient died of pulmonary complications after being in stable condition for 6 months. The results support the possible use of intensive immunosuppression with ALG and CsA for DC-associated SAA as an alternative treatment for patients who are not eligible for HSCT.
