A study was made of the survival time of erythrocytes labeled with 51Cr in 30 patients with hypoplastic anemia. In 96.7% of the patients erythrocyte survival time was reduced (from 18 to 3.6 days; an average of 11.8 days), an increase in the number of macrocytes was noted (in 83.3%). The mean volume and thickness of erythrocytes were also on an increase (in 95.8%); a decrease in the spherical index of erythrocytes was noted (in 91.6%). In this connection erythrokaryocyte proliferation enhancement was noted in 58.3% of the patients in parallel with a decrease in the total number of myelokaryocytes in 37.5%. The patients' response to multimodality therapy was different irrespective of erythrocyte survival time in the patients with hypoplastic anemia. In satisfactory preservation of medullary hemopoietic foci, particularly with polymorphous cell composition, multimodality therapy including splenectomy, produced mainly a curative effect in patients of different age with hypoplastic anemia.
