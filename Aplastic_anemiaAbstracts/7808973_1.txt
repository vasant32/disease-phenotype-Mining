Although Alternaria is a very common soil saprophyte and plant pathogen fungus, human infections are rare. A 6-year-old boy with aplastic anemia presented with generalized erythematous papules. Skin biopsies revealed granulomas with fungal elements and grew Alternaria alternata. The lesions disappeared following 7 weeks of antifungal treatment.
