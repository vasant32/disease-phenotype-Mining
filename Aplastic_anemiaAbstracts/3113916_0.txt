Bone marrow aplasia associated with acute viral hepatitis is a rare, in the rule late complication. A prognostic relation between the latency of acute hepatitis and the development of aplastic anemia is described. We report a case of nearly symptomless hepatitis in a 25 year old women with a fatal course of aplastic anemia. First clinical symptoms were caused by aplastic anemia. The pathogenesis of aplastic anemia associated to viral hepatitis is obscure. Genetic and immunological causes are discussed. A direct viral action is possible. Because the main part of the described cases is caused by non-A, non-B hepatitis, it seems apparent that at least a non-A, non-B virus strain could have an affinity to bone marrow cells. Ensuring this, relations will be impossible up to the identification of the virus.
