Trichothecenes are mycotoxins produced by various species of fungi, which can occur on various agricultural products. Among these compounds, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON) are the most naturally encountered and the most potent trichothecenes. Consumption of trichothecene contaminated foods by farm animals and humans leads to mycotoxicosis. Trichothecenes are known to induce haematological disorders such as neutropenia, aplastic anemia and thrombocytopenia in humans and animals. Four trichothecenes, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, DAS and DON have been tested on human platelet progenitors (CFU-MK) using a culture model of CFU-MK optimized for toxicological studies. Trichothecenes cause, at low concentrations, cytotoxic effects in megakaryocyte progenitors, which could induce thrombocytopenia. Sensitivity of human CFU-MK is compared to respective sensitivities of human red blood cell progenitors (BFU-E) and white blood cell progenitors (CF-U-GM) that were described in previous works.
