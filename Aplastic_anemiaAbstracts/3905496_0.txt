A bone marrow transplant had to be performed in a woman of 25 years of age because of severe aplastic anaemia. Immunosuppressive conditioning treatment consisted of 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide given for four consecutive days. Regular menses reappeared already after four months. Pregnancy was confirmed after a year that resulted in giving birth to a healthy child in the 38th week of pregnancy via Caesarean section.
