 OBJECTIVE: To determine the need of bone marrow examination in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) at initial presentation. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY: Pediatric Units of Children Hospital, Islamabad, from January 1999 to December 2003. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children, clinically suspected to have ITP, who underwent bone marrow examination, were included After reviewing the file records of these patients for history, examination and investigations, a predesigned proforma was filled and data was analyzed, using SPSS version 10 for statistical analysis. The results were reported in the form of frequencies, percentages and mean. RESULTS: A majority of the children were between 48 to 96 months, with a mean age of 54.43 months. Male to female ratio was 1.45:1. Mean platelet count was 33861/mm(3). None of the bone marrow results showed the presence of abnormal cells consistent with hematological malignancy. ITP was the final diagnosis in 52 patients. One patient was diagnosed to have megakaryocytic hypoplasia. Bone marrow aspiration in one patient was hypoplastic, and subsequently, he was diagnosed to have aplastic anemia on trephine biopsy. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow aspiration should not be a part of routine work-up for diagnosing ITP in children and should be reserved for those children having atypical clinical and laboratory features.
