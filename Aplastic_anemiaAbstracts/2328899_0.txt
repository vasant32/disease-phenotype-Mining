Soviet preparation of antilymphocytic globulin "Antilympholin" was used for the treatment of 24 children with acquired aplastic anemia. The preparation contained lymphocytotoxic antibodies and antibodies against the most important opportunistic microorganisms, thus combining the immunosuppressive and protective properties. A single dose of "Antilympholin" was 10-15 mg/kg (10-15 transfusions), the treatment course comprised 150 mg/kg. Infusion of haploidentical bone marrow was conducted in 14 children. Side effects of "Antilympholin" therapy expressed in allergic reactions were recorded in 37.4% of the patients. An early hematologic effect was achieved in 17 children (70.8%) after 1-1.5 months. It was expressed in the elimination of hemotransfusion requirement, and in the improvement of hemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil values. Hemopoietic recovery took place only in those patients who had at least minimum residual hemopoiesis. Late survival (according to Caplan-Meyer) comprised 62.1%, as compared to 30.6% in the control group of patients who received the hormonal therapy. The results of "Antilympholin" application to the treatment of children with acquired aplastic anemia have evidenced its high effectiveness which is comparable with that of foreign preparations of antilymphocytic globulin.
