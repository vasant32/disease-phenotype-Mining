The serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration was measured by radioimmunoassy in 41 women with or without hormonal contraception, 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis given corticosteroids or not, and 6 patients under androgen therapy for aplastic anemia. None of these therapies induced any significant variation of the serum alpha-fetoprotein level. More extensive studies are needed to investigate the possible effect of these hormones on the metabolism of this protein at a cellular level.
