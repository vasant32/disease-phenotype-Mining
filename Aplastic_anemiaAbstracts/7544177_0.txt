The testing kit of second generation for serum anti-HCV was used in 82 cases of aplastic anemia (AA). The results showed that positive rate was 69.4% (43/62) in the patients of AA with transfusion, this was significantly higher than that in the patients of AA without transfusion. There was no difference of anti-HCV antibody positive rate between chronic AA and acute AA (P > 0.05), incidence rate of post-transfusion hepatitis C (PTHC) in AA was 33.9% (21/62), among which the incidence rate in acute and chronic AA were 68.8% (11/16) and 21.7% (10/46) respectively (P < 0.01). The anti-HCV positive patients were divided into two groups: PTHC and non-PTHC, there was no statistical difference of their transfusion volume, hemoglobin, white blood cell between these groups. Response rate of AA was lower in anti-HCV positive patients than that in negative patients (P < 0.05). Acute, icteric PTHC was predominant in patients with AA. The patients with AA complicated with PTHC was liable to bleed and be infected. PTHC has been an important complication in patients with AA. The better response was obtained by TCM-WM therapy in the patients.
