Anemia remains a therapeutic problem in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In view of the recently reported potential of stem cell factor (SCF) in restoring erythropoiesis in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), we first aimed to define a correlation between SCF serum levels and anemia in MDS. Endogenous SCF levels in 50 MDS patients were determined by using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Broad interindividual variations were observed, but SCF serum levels were in the normal range with no correlation to peripheral blood count. A soft agar culture system was used to further define the role of SCF for stimulation of erythroid growth. Bone marrow mononucleated cells of 20 MDS patients (4 refractory anemia, 5 refractory anemia with excess of blasts, 7 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transition, and 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) were investigated, and SCF plus Epo was able to stimulate burst-forming unit-erythroid significantly more than SCF or Epo alone independent of French-American-British group. When mononucleated cells from six MDS patients (two refractory anemia, two refractory anemia with excess of blasts, and 2 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transition) with elevated serum Epo levels were incubated in the presence of SCF and autologous serum, a significant dose-dependent stimulation of burst-forming unit-erythroid number and cells per colony was detected. Erythroid differentiation was further enhanced by adding serum with high colony-stimulating activity obtained from patients with severe aplastic anemia. Our data suggest that in MDS patients with high endogenous Epo serum levels SCF alone might be effective in stimulating erythropoiesis in vivo.
