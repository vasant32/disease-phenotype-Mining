Ten patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and seven patients with refractory anemia (RA) were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and erythropoietin (rhEpo) in combination. rhG-CSF (5-20 micrograms/kg) and rhEpo (120-720 U/kg) were administered by s.c. injection three times a week for at least six months, and the administration was continued as maintenance therapy for as long as possible when hematological responses were observed. Six (60%) of the ten AA patients and four (58%) of the seven RA patients showed multilineage responses. Of these responders, six patients achieved trilineage recovery. While all of the responders were dependent on red blood cell transfusions and eight of them required platelet transfusions before treatment, they now no longer need transfusions of either red blood cells or platelets. A median treatment duration of 9 (range 1 to 28) months was required to achieve multilineage recovery. The responders showed an ability to maintain the multilineage recovery for 9+ to 47+ months and to tolerate long-term treatment. These results indicate that the long-term treatment with rhG-CSF and rhEpo may benefit a substantial percentage of patients with AA and RA and provide an optional therapy for these patients.
