In order to assess the epidemiology of Hepatitis-Associated Aplasia (HAA) and compare treatment outcome of HAA with non-HAA patients, we evaluated 3916 aplastic anaemia patients reported to the European Registry between 1990 and 2007. Year, month, season of diagnosis, type and outcome of first-line therapy were analysed. Prevalence of HAA (n = 214) in Europe was 5%. Compared to non-HAA patients, HAA patients were younger (15 vs. 20 years, P < 0.001), with a male prevalence (68% vs. 58% P = 0.002), and were treated earlier after diagnosis (46 vs. 62 d; P < 0.001). No significant differences were found regarding the year or month of diagnosis. No geographic clusters could be identified. Actuarial survival at 10 years after first-line immunosuppression was 69%, and did not differ according to aetiology. The 10-year actuarial survival after transplantation was 70%, and was comparable in HAA and non-HAA patients, when stratified for age and donor type. In a multivariate Cox analysis, increasing age and delayed treatment were significant negative indicators for survival. In conclusion, the incidence of HAA was 5% and was evenly distributed over time and geographic areas in Europe. Treatment outcome and predictive variables, were comparable in patients with or without HAA.
