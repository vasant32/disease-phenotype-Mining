Excluding the most frequent kinds of problems seen with the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID)--gastritis, peptic ulceration and renal effects--published reports indicate that these drugs may cause a wide variety of rare adverse reactions. The most serious of these are hypersensitivity reactions: blood dyscrasias (aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia), erythema multiforme and hepatitis. Aseptic meningitis and anaphylactoid reactions may strike patients with underlying immunologic abnormalities; urticaria, bronchospasm and proctocolitis may affect aspirin-sensitive patients. Other unusual reactions include several kinds of bullous dermatitis, febrile reactions, pneumonitis, esophageal ulceration, parotitis, pancreatitis and neurological or psychological effects.
