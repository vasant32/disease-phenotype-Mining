We analyzed the outcomes of 44 children with hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAA) who received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA). Fourteen (31.8%) patients achieved complete response and 17 (38.6%) achieved partial response, for an overall response rate of 70.4% after 6 months. Seven non-responders received bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched unrelated donor and 6 out of 7 are alive. The probability of overall survival at 10 years was 88.3+/-4.9%, which supports the role of IST with ATG and CsA as treatment of choice for children with HAA without an HLA identical sibling donor.
