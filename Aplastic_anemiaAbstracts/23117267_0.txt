 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and reasons for return to the primary acute care service among patients with leukemia undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of all patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, or myelofibrosis admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at a tertiary referral-based cancer center between January 1, 2005, and April 10, 2012. Items analyzed from patient records included return to the primary acute care service with demographic information, leukemia characteristics, medications, hospital admission characteristics, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were admitted a total of 255 times. Ninety-three (37%) of the 255 leukemia inpatient rehabilitation admissions returned to the primary acute care service. Eighteen (19%) and 42 (45%) of the 93 patients died in the hospital and were discharged home, respectively. Statistically significant factors (P < 0.05) associated with return to the primary acute care service include peripheral blast percentage and the presence of an antifungal agent on the day of the inpatient rehabilitation transfer. Using additional two factors (platelet count and the presence of an antiviral agent, both P < 0.11), the Return to Primary-Leukemia Index was formulated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemia with the presence of circulating peripheral blasts and/or an antifungal agent may be at increased risk for return to the primary acute care service. The Return to Primary-Leukemia Index should be tested in prospective studies to determine its usefulness.
