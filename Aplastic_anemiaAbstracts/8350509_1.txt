With a newly developed short term enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit (TOYOBO Co.), in which 2 kinds of anti-EPO monoclonal antibodies were used, we assayed EPO concentration in sera from patients with renal failure and hematological disorders. In this report, the EPO data were analysed in relation to serum iron concentrations, with ferritin and UIBC. In the patients with renal failure, there was no significant correlation between EPO concentration and serum iron, ferritin, nor UIBC concentration. On the other hand, in the patients with hematological disorders, there were two types. One was in patients with iron deficiency anemia, whose serum EPO was negatively correlated to serum iron (r = -0.64) and ferritin (r = -0.59), but positively related to UIBC (r = 0.27). The another was the pattern in patients with aplastic anemia, leukemia and MDS, whose serum EPO positively correlated to iron and ferritin but negatively correlated to UIBC. In the patients with aplastic anemia serum EPO had good correlation to serum iron (r = 0.62), ferritin (r = 0.60) and UIBC (r = -0.46). The relationship of EPO to iron in the patients with leukemia (r = 0.54), and EPO to ferritin in the patients with MDS (r = 0.42) show significantly positive correlation coefficient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
