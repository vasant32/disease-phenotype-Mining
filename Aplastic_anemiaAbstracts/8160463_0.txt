Marrow transplantation has proved to be an important modality in the treatment of aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and some other malignant diseases of hemopoietic cells. Much less attention has been paid to the role of marrow transplantation in the treatment of stem cell disorders such as sickle cell disease, chronic granulomatous disease, or Gaucher's disease. Allogeneic transplantation is successful in these disorders, but carries a considerable risk to the recipient. Autologous transplantation becomes a reality when efficient gene transfer with sustained expression is developed. As methods are developed to harvest hemopoietic stem cells from the peripheral blood and to amplify these cells without causing them to differentiate, transplantation will become increasingly valuable in the treatment of stem cell disorders.
