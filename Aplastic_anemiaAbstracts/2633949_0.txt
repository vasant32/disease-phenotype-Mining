The best results of the therapeutic immunosuppression in a plastic anemia have been obtained with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). Considering this, 14 patients with this disease, 9 females and 5 males, from 8 to 60 years of age, were given ALG (40 mg/K/day/4 days) and corticosteroids. Fifty one percent of them, older than 30 years of age, showed partial or minimal remissions of the disorder. According to this result ALG administration together with bone-marrow transplantation in younger patients may offer effective treatment for a generally fatal disease to a greater number of patients.
