Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (MIM #604498) (CAMT) is a rare inherited disease presenting as severe thrombocytopenia in infancy. Untreated, many CAMT patients develop aplastic anemia within the first decade of life; the only effective treatment of CAMT is bone marrow transplantation. CAMT is the result of the presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor-encoding gene, MPL. We report here the identification and characterization of a founder mutation in MPL in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. This mutation, termed c.79+2T>A, is a T to A transversion in the invariant second base of the intron 1 donor splice site. Analysis of a random sample of 2018 individuals of AJ descent revealed a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 75. Genotyping of six loci adjacent to the MPL gene in the proband and in the 27 individuals identified as carriers of the c.79+2T>A mutation revealed that the presence of this mutation in the AJ population is due to a single founder. The observed carrier frequency predicts an incidence of CAMT in the AJ population of approximately 1 in 22,500 pregnancies. The identification of this mutation will enable population carrier testing and will facilitate the identification and treatment of individuals homozygous for this mutation.
