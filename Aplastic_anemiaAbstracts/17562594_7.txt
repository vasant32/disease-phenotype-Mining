We report on the first successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in an HIV-infected patient with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) per- formed at a tertiary care institution. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was administered until transplantation and restarted 34 days later with sustained virological response. The patient did however develop a rapid rise in HIV load during the interruption of HAART associated with an acute febrile illness. Due to the extended period between the onset of SAA until SCT, the posttransplant course was complicated by bacterial infections. Stage two skin GvHD, but no AIDS-defining opportunistic diseases were experienced. Neutrophils recovered to >0.5/nL on day +18 and the CD4 count reached 250/microL on day +71 and >500/microL on day +182. The patient is in good condition with an ECOG score of 0 twelve months after transplantation. This report demonstrates the feasibility of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the HIV setting.
