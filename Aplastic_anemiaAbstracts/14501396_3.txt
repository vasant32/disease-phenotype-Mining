Fusarium species, or saprophytic molds, are important plant pathogens and recognized as agents of human mycotic infections. Frequently superficial, deep-tissue involvement, and dissemination occurs in immunocompromised hosts with hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, and chemotherapy treatment. Presented in this work is a burn patient with a fatal disseminated infection in addition to a review of the literature. A 40-year-old white male acquired a 73% grease scald injury at work. His hospital course was interspersed with multiple episodes of Flavobacterium, Fusarium, Candida, Proteus, Enterococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Serratia infections. He underwent nine operative procedures for debridement, excision, and skin grafting. The last operative procedure included bilateral below knee amputations to halt an invasive Fusarium infection that was invading normal unburned skin. The patient died 55 days after injury. Fusarium and Aspergillus infections are frequently confused and do not have characteristic clinical features. With the prolonged survival of severely burned patients, better fungal diagnostic and treatment modalities are needed to improve outcome.
