Research was carried out in 335 blood specimens of patients in the age of 3-35 y.o. in order to optimize diagnosis and treatment of such patients with aplastic anemia and hemoblastosis who got hemotransfunction to eliminate cytomegaloviral infection (CMVI). IgM were found out in 37.9% cases (2.8 times higher than in donors), low-avide IgG--in 44.8%. "early" proteins CMV--29.9% and DNA--in 36.8% cases. Concerning the DNA presence, preference was given to research of leucocytic suspension compared with blood serum. Of 28 children of 3-13 y.o. with anemia being seropositive in CMV, IgG antibodies were detected in 13 children while IgM antibodies to Parvovirus B19 were found in 10 children. 7 children with a grave form of disease showed combined infection of Parvovirus B19 and CMV with activation signs. It is not excluded that parallel influence of Parvovirus B19 on erythrocytic hemopoiesis growth and that of CMV on lymphocytic-monocytis cells aggravates immunodeficiency and promotes development of infection complications.
