 INTRODUCTION: Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from blood or bone marrow has become accepted therapy for many diseases. Numbers of transplants have increased significantly and stem cell source, donor type and indications have changed during this decade. Information on these changes is essential for interpretation of current data, patient counseling and health care planning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1990, members of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and teams known to perform blood or marrow transplants have been invited annually to report their transplant numbers by indication, donor type and stem cell source. Data from these surveys have been used to present data for 1998, to assess current status and to give numbers of transplants per participating country, coefficients of variation between countries for individual indications and changes in indication, stem cell source and donor type over the past decade. RESULTS: In 1998, a total of 20 892 transplants were performed by 528 teams in 31 European countries. Of these transplants 18 400 were first transplants, 5308 (29%) were allogenic, and 13 092 (71%) were autologous. Of the autologous transplants, 809 (6%) were bone marrow derived, and 12 283 (94%) were from peripheral blood stems cells. Of the allogeneic transplants, 3372 (64%) were bone marrow derived, and 1936 (36%) were peripheral blood stem cell transplants. In 1990, the respective figures were 2137 allogeneic (50%) and 2097 (50%) autologous transplants, all exclusively bone marrow derived. Main indications in 1998 were leukemias with 6015 transplants (33%), 68% thereof allogeneic transplants; lymphomas with 7492 transplants (41%), 94% thereof autologous transplants; solid tumors with 4025 transplants (22%), 99% thereof autologous transplants; non-malignant disorders with 868 transplants (5%), 80% thereof allogeneic transplants. Absolute numbers of transplants per year did increase from 4234 in 1990 to 20 892 in 1998. Increase is higher for autologous, than for allogeneic transplants. There were differences in absolute or relative increase over time for individual indications. Transplant rates per number of inhabitants varied between countries, ranging from 0 to >500 total transplants per 10 million inhabitants with a clear correlation between number of teams and transplants per 10 million inhabitants (r=0.61, P<0.001). The least variation between countries was observed for acute leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia and severe aplastic anemia in allogeneic transplants, for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in autologous transplants. CONCLUSION: These data reflect the current status of blood and marrow transplantation in Europe. They show the continuing increase in utilization, highlight the change from bone marrow to blood as stem cell source and give an objective assessment on presence or absence of trends.
