Iron overload due to regular transfusions of packed red cells can cause multiple organ damage. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) is important in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) who require blood transfusions as supportive management. With the introduction of the oral iron chelator deferasirox, ICT has become more widely available and feasible. We studied 4 adult AA patients who had transfusion-induced iron overload and showed hematological improvement after ICT with oral deferasirox. Following deferasirox treatment, hemoglobin increased and serum ferritin levels decreased, and the patients subsequently became transfusion independent. Our experience raises the possibility of the potential benefit of ICT on hematopoiesis. Further long-term studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to clarify the effect of the restoration of hematopoiesis after iron chelation therapy.
