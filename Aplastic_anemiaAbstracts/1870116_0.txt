Bone marrow transplantation makes it possible to treat patients with malignancies using doses of systemic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy that otherwise would result in fatal hematologic toxicity. This approach has found its widest application in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but it is also being used for aplastic anemia, severe immunodeficiency diseases, and selected solid tumors. The University of Mississippi will soon (October, 1991) be able to offer this treatment approach to Mississippians; therefore the indications, the general technique, and results of transplantation for a variety of diseases are reviewed herein.
