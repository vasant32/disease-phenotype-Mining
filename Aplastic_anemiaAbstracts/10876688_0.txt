Morphology of peripheral blood erythrocytes was studied in patients with acute leukemia and aplastic anemia by a Russian cytoanalyzer Mekos-C. Twenty-eight patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 15 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 11 with aplastic anemia were examined. Erythrocytes (n = 500) were examined in fixed non-stained blood smears. Hemoglobin content and morphometric parameters of each cell were studied and automatic classification of cells was carried out. The data of computer morphodensitometry are compatible with the data of cytochemical studies of the bone marrow erythroid cells (PAS reaction after McManus). The results indicate circulation of erythrocyte subpopulations differing by shape and other signs (hemoglobin content, section area, shape factor) in the blood of patients with acute leukemia and aplastic anemia. The share of pathological erythrocytes in the peripheral blood reflects failure of erythropoiesis.
