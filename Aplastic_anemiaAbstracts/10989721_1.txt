Pefloxacin (Abaktal) efficacy and safety were investigated at 21 children (7-16 years old) randomized in 2 groups: children with mucoviscidosis and children with aplastic anemia. The drug was used at the dose 15-20 mg/kg per day bid for 14-28 days. Pefloxacin was used in combination with ceftazidime and amikacin. Combined therapy demonstrated good clinical efficacy. Bacteriological efficacy was not uniform: staphylococci were not isolated from sputum since the 7th day of treatment, but pseudomonads were cultured even on the 14th day of the treatment (the sensitivity to pefloxacin remained). The only but frequent side-effect was arthropathy. The background and some peculiarities of arthropathy development were analyzed. This phenomenon is called quinolone-induced synovitis. The risk group for quinolone-induced synovitis was estimated--children elder than 10 years with allergic anamnesis. Good clinical efficacy and tolerability of pefloxacin at the children with mucoviscidosis or aplastic anemia is a reason and base to cancel the limits to its use in pediatrics.
