Growth and growth hormone (GH) were investigated every year in 24 children after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or leukemia. Conditioning included total body irradiation (TBI) in all cases of leukemia. The young leukemic children grew poorly. At 4 years after BMT, the mean standard deviation score for attained height had decreased from 0 to -1.73. GH deficiency was diagnosed with provocation tests. Three years after BMT, 10/18 children had a subnormal response. Ten children were further investigated with 24-hour GH profiles. Children with SAA had normal growth and GH levels. TBI seemed to be the major factor responsible for impaired growth.
