A full-term normal male child was delivered using forceps fifteen months after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a woman who presented with severe acute aplastic anemia. The uneventful course of this pregnancy demonstrates that the high-dose cylcophosphamide administration used to prepare the patient for the procedure need not irreversibly suppress ovarian or endocrine function. This observation has relevance for the increasing numbers of young patients with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
