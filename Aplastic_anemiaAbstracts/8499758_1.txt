Idiopathic pure red-cell aplasia was successfully treated by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin infusions (HDivIg) in 2 patients; 1 of these patients was refractory to other immunosuppressive drugs. We have observed responses to this therapy also in 3 of 5 patients--without pretreatment--with severe aplastic anemia. HDivIg treatment had no significant side effects; patients with aplastic syndromes could be treated as outpatients. Patients responding to HDivIg demonstrated different response patterns to ciclosporin A. Sequential treatment of aplastic syndromes with high-dose prednisone, HDivIg and ciclosporin A was effective in 6 of 7 patients. The results in this pilot study are comparable to those with other immunosuppressive strategies in patients with severe aplastic anemia who lack a bone marrow donor. Optimal dosage, sequence, and duration of this treatment modality remain to be defined.
