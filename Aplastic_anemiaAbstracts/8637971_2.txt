Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) may be associated with inhibition of hematopoiesis mediated by antibodies, T-cells or both. A 41-year-old woman with a five-year history of SLE treated with prednisone was admitted to Cabrini Medical Center in New York. The patient complained of fever, chills, arthralgias, general malaise, weakness and dyspnea on exertion, and showed malar rash, pallor, and a systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border. Admission work up included a CBC with evidence of moderate pancytopenia, a normal EKG, and a normal chest X-ray. The patient's anemia was symptomatic and required a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC's). Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed an aplastic marrow with few hypoplastic islands of hematopoietic elements. The patient was treated with plasmapheresis, achieving immediate progress towards recovery. Bone marrow culture studies (erythroid BFU-E, and myeloid CFU-GM) were done by incubating various titers of the patient's acute phase plasma with normal bone marrow cells. This was done to determine if the patient's plasma contained any hematopoietic inhibitory activity, as has been reported in other cases. Our experiments demonstrated marked inhibition of erymathropoiesis and myelopoiesis in vitro, when various titers of the patient's plasma were included in the culture media. Control plasma produced no inhibition. These studies support the hypothesis that a circulating antibody which inhibits hematopoiesis may be produced in SLE patients with aplastic anemia, and be responsible for it.
