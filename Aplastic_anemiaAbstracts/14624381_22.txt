SEN virus (SENV) has been tentatively linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis. We investigated SENV's role in unexplained hepatitis in other settings. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to detect 2 SENV variants (SENV-D and SENV-H) in 1706 patients and control subjects. SENV was detected in 54 (22%) of 248 patients with acute or chronic non-A-E hepatitis, 9 (35%) of 26 patients with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, and 0 of 17 patients with cryptogenic acute liver failure, compared with 150 (24%) of 621 control subjects with liver disease and 76 (10%) of 794 healthy control subjects. When controlling for geographic region, the prevalence of SENV among case and control subjects was not significantly different. The severity of acute or chronic hepatitis A, B, or C was not influenced by coexisting SENV infection. No etiological role for SENV in the cause of cryptogenic hepatitis could be demonstrated.
