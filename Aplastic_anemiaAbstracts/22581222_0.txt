Legionnaire disease (LD) is infrequently considered in the differential diagnoses for hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatrics. We report a case of Legionnaire disease in a 19-year-old male with aplastic anemia after bone marrow transplant, who was being treated in a children's hospital. Severe, refractory pulmonary disease necessitated pneumonectomy to control the infection.
