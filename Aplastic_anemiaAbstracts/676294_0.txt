Hemorrhagic manifestations were found in 142 (66.6%) out of 213 followed up patients with hypo- and aplastic anemia. Detailed clinical-laboratory study on the hemorrhagic syndrome was conducted in 58 of them. The hemorrhagic manifestations display a considerable polymorphism, being present both at the onset of the disease and its course. Changes in the laboratory tests were also found, associated mainly with thrombocytopenia. The tests, reflecting coagulation states, were most often normal. In four of the patients, hemorrhagia was due to disseminated intravasal coagulation. No correlation was found between granulocyte number and Factor VIII level.
