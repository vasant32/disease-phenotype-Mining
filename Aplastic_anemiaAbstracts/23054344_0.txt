 BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia (AA) is an autoimmune disease and interleukin-27 (IL-27) is an important cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. To date there have been no reports concerning the intrinsic association among IL-27 and Thelper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells in AA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assay IL-27, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-17 levels, flow cytometry to measure the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the mRNA levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, T-bet and IL-17 and retinoid related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt) in PBMCs were performed. In addition, the effect of exogenous rhIL-27 on the differentiation of T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Plasma and mRNA levels of IL-27 in PBMCs from AA patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. A positive correlation was found between plasma levels of IL27 and IFN-γ. The proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells accompanied by the mRNA expression of RORγt and T-bet were significantly higher in AA patients than in healthy controls. Plasma levels of IL-27 correlated positively with frequencies of Th1 cells in AA patients. Exogenous rhIL-27 could significantly upregulate the frequency of Th1 cells and the mRNA levels of T-bet and IFN-γ and the application of rhIL-27 in vitro could inhibit the expression of RORγt mRNA. CONCLUSION: The upregulation of IL-27 might cause Th1 differentiation and immune disorders in AA patients. Blocking the expression of IL-27 could therefore be a reasonable therapeutic strategy for AA.
