Bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched allogeneic donors was used to treat two series of patients with severe aplastic anemia. No significant differences were detected in all comparisons made between the Registry series (38 patients) and the Seattle series (24 patients), and pooled data from the two series were used in the analyses. Currently, 55% of the patients who received bone marrow transplants within three months of diagnosis are alive, but only 13% of the patients who received bone marrow transplants more than nine months after diagnosis are alive. The difference between the two groups was significant (P less than .02). Patients less than 21 years of age had a significantly higher survival rate than those patients who were 21 years or older at the time of transplantation (P less than .02). Survival rates were significantly higher for patients who had received 15 or fewer pretransplant transfusions than those who received more (P less than .05).
