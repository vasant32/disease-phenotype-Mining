The objective of this study was to quantify subpopulations of CD34+ cells such as CD41+ and CD42+ cells that might represent megakaryocyte (MK) precursors in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collections of normal, recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) primed donors and to determine whether there is a statistical association between the dose infused megakaryocytic precursors and the time course of the platelet recovery following an allogeneic PBSC transplantation. Twenty-six patients with various hematologic malignancies transplanted from their HLA identical siblings between July 1997 and December 1999 were used. All patients except one with severe aplastic anemia who had cyclophosphamide (CY) alone received busulfan-CY as preparative regimen and cyclosporine-methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. Normal healthy donors were given rhG-CSF 10 microg/kg/day subcutaneously twice daily and PBSCs were collected on days 5 and 6. The median number of infused CD34+, CD41+ and CD42+ cells were 6.61 x 10(6)/kg (range 1.47-21.41), 54.85 x 10(4)/kg (5.38-204.19), and 49.86 x 10(4)/kg (6.82-430.10), respectively. Median days of ANC 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet 20 x 10(9)/L were 11.5 (range 9-15) and 13 (8-33), respectively. In this study, the number of CD41+ and CD42+ cells infused much better correlated than the number of CD34+ cells infused with the time to platelet recovery of 20 x 10(9)/L in 26 patients receiving an allogeneic match sibling PBSC transplantation (r = -0.727 and P < 0.001 for CD41+ cells, r = -0.806 and P < 0.001 for CD42+ cells, r = -0.336 and P > 0.05 for CD34+ cells). There was an inverse correlation between the number of infused CD41+ and CD42+ cells and duration of platelet engraftment. Therefore, as the number of CD41+ and CD42+ cells increased, duration of platelet engraftment (time to reach platelet count of > or = 20 x 10(9)/L) shortened significantly. Based on this data we may conclude that flow cytometric measurement of CD41+ and CD42+ progenitor cells may provide an accurate indication of platelet reconstitutive capacity of the allogeneic PBSC transplant.
