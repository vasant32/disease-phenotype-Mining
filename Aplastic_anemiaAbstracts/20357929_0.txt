Successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), both autologous and allogeneic, requires a rapid and durable engraftment, with neutrophil (>500/microL) and platelet (>20,000/microL) reconstitution. Factors influencing engraftment after autologous or allogeneic HSCT were investigated in 65 patients: 25 autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients. The major factor affecting engraftment was the graft source for HSCT. Neutrophil and platelet recovery were more rapid in autologous PBSCT than in allogeneic BMT [neutrophil occurring in median on day 10.00 (09.00/11.00) and 19.00 (16.00/23.00) and platelet on day 11.00 (10.00/13.00) and 21.00 (18.00/25.00), respectively; p < 0.0001]. The type of disease also affected engraftment, where multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphoma showed faster engraftment when compared with leukemia, syndrome myelodysplastic (SMD) and aplastic anemia (AA) and MM presented the best overall survival (OS) in a period of 12 months. Other factors included the drug used in the conditioning regimen (CR), where CBV, melphalan (M-200) and FluCy showed faster engraftment and M-200 presented the best OS, in a period of 12 months and age, where 50-59 years demonstrated faster engraftment. Sex did not influence neutrophil and platelet recovery.
