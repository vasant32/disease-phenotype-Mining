This paper describes factors that affect the coping processes of adolescents with aplastic anemia and infants with severe combined immuno-deficiency disease treated on a reverse isolation unit. The adolescents demonstrated a rich diversity of coping styles depending on the interaction of a variety of factors. Special stresses to other family members, such as the reactions of the child donor, are also highlighted. For the infants, the dyadic relationship with the mothering figure, the feelings of the family about the fact of genetic transmission, and the impact of isolation on the infant's development are identified as important psychosocial variables in the infant's adjustment. A multidimensional perspective such as that provided within a systems framework, which encourages an appreciation of the interactive diversity of all factors, is presented as the most useful approach to interventions.
