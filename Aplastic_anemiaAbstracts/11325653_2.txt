We gave a regimen of cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (CY/ATG) to six patients with early stage severe aplastic anemia (SAA) transplanted with marrow from alternative donors. All patients engrafted and are alive with durable engraftment at a median follow-up of 406 days. The CY/ATG regimen may be sufficient in Korean patients with early stage SAA receiving marrow transplantation from alternative donors.
