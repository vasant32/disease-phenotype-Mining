Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare hereditary disorder of skin which may be associated with aplastic anemia. The pattern of inheritance is X-linked recessive in most instances, but autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive types have been documented. Reticulated hyperpigmentation usually is the first manifestation. The pigmentary changes may be limited to neck, upper chest, and proximal parts of the limbs initially but within affected areas the involvement is always diffuse. We report on a patient with typical diffuse cutaneous signs of dyskeratosis congenita superimposed with hyperpigmentation that was more pronounced along Blaschko's lines. To explain this phenomenon, we assume that the patient has the autosomal dominant type and that loss of heterozygosity occurred in a somatic cell giving rise to a population of cells that migrated along these lines during embryogenesis.
