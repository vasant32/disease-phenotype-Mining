An 83-year-old woman received a diagnosis of moderate aplastic anemia in November 1990. Immunosuppressive therapy consisting of anti-lymphocyte globulin combined with high-dose corticosteroids was effective until pancytopenia developed in August 1993. The patient was hospitalized again and recurrence of aplastic anemia was diagnosed on the basis of hematologic findings, including RBC 129 x 10(4)/microliter, Hb 5.5 g/dl, Ret 23,200/microliter, WBC 2,200/microliter with 27% neutrophils, platelets 2.2 x 10(4)/microliter, and hypoplastic bone marrow. Recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) of 125 micrograms/day combined with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) of 6,000 U/day were started in November 1993. The doses of G-CSF and EPO were increased to 250 micrograms/day and 12,000 U/day, respectively. We stopped combination therapy in March 1995, after trilineage hematopoietic cell recovery had been achieved. Complete recovery in peripheral blood was sustained for more than 2 years despite the termination of G-CSF and EPO therapy. Combination therapy with G-CSF and EPO may be safe and effective for elderly patients with aplastic anemia when the choice of therapy is limited.
