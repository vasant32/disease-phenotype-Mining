Long-term survivors of aplastic anemia (AA) have a high incidence of clonal disorders, in particular paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. To investigate the potential involvement of N-RAS gene mutations in the predisposition to leukemic evolution, a subset of patients at potentially increased risk for clonal disease was selected based on evidence of existing clonal evolution. Nine patients showed a monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, 18 demonstrated a PNH clone, and in 3 MDS developed during the course of this study. No mutations were detected during the aplastic phase of disease; 2 of 3 patients with MDS after AA also showed no mutations. However, in 1 patient in whom the disease transformed from AA/PNH to MDS, a mutation of GGT --> GAT at N-RAS codon 13 became detectable, whereas the PNH mutation disappeared. The authors conclude that N-RAS mutations are not an early event preceding transformation of AA or AA/PNH to leukemia. In a subset of patients, RAS mutations may occur at the time of evolution to MDS, but preexisting RAS mutations do not explain the propensity of AA to leukemogenesis. Although PNH is also associated with leukemia, this may arise in the non-PNH cells, indicating that PIG-A gene mutation is not per se oncogenic. (Blood. 2000;95:646-650)
