This article summarizes the progress of hematology in the recent tens years to show that experimental hematology used to pick up the 'hints' from clinical problems as the renewal of research directions and targets in experimental studies continuously. As the feedback, the results from lab investigations inserted into clinical practice and eventually made a quick modernization of hematology, which was actually a good model for the "translational research". The past few decades have witnessed tremendous advances in our understanding of normal hematopoiesis where genes dictate, epigenetics regulate, transcription factors mediate, and stem cells self-renew and differentiate. Dissection of disease pathogenesis not only elucidates molecular basis of disorders including hemoglobinopathy, aplastic anemia, hemophilia, hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders, but also provides therapeutic targets for drug development. Introduction of targeted therapies and combinatory targeting therapies greatly benefits hundreds of thousands of patients, and even turns acute promyelocytic leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable. In the 21st century the experimental hematology is entering the era of genomics and system biomedicine, and the pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of hematologic neoplasms control in this century.
