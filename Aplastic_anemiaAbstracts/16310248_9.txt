Aplastic anemia (AA) is a syndrome of hematopoietic failure involving increased apoptosis of stem cells. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms participated in the process of marrow failure, we created an in vitro model of hematopoietic cell suppression, by continuous addition of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in an vitro long-term bone marrow culture system. An up-regulation of Fas expression was observed in CD34+ cells in cytokine treated cultures, compared to controls. This was accompanied by significant TRAIL and decreased caspase 3 mRNA expression, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 family members was low (Bcl-xl) or absent (Bcl-2, Bax). The expression of these apoptotic genes was also investigated in aplastic anemia patients. Apart from Fas mRNA expression in total marrow and/or CD34+ cells, TRAIL mRNA expression was found only in CD34+ cells in active disease while in total marrow cell compartment this remains a constant finding even in patients in remission. The above data are in agreement with previous studies proposing a major role for the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia and additionally introduce TRAIL as a probable important molecule in the process.
