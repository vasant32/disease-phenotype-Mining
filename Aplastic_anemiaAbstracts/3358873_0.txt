The authors report the case of a female infant with bone marrow aplasia associated with neonatal giant-cell hepatitis. In addition to noting the exceptionality of this case, the possible interdependence of the two processes is discussed, and it is proposed that bone marrow aplasia, as in the adult, may represent a complication of viral disease (hepatitis).
