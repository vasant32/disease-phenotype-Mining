An automated reticulocyte counter using flowcytometric analysis, the R-3000 (Sysmex Inc. Kobe, Japan), has recently been modified to determine reticulated platelets (RPs) and large platelets (LPs). We measured frequencies of RPs, LPs in total platelet count and serum thrombopoietin concentration comprehensively in non-neoplastic thrombocytopenic patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, n = 23), aplastic anemia (AA, n = 21), liver cirrhosis (LC, n= 17), and hematologically normal subjects (control, n = 151). ITP was characterized as high frequencies of both RP and LP, AA as high RP frequency and elevated thrombopoietin concentration, and LC as no difference compared with control. Interestingly, the frequency of RP appeared to depend on total platelet count rather than the cause of thrombocytopenia, while the frequency of LP appeared to depend much less on total platelet count. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between frequencies of RP and LP in control, ITP and LC subjects, in whom bone marrow stem cells are intrinsically normal. However, there was no such correlation in AA patients with stem cell deficiency, suggesting that this correlation might be a useful new parameter for detecting qualitatively abnormal platelets. Measurement of RP and LP is thus useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenic disorders.
