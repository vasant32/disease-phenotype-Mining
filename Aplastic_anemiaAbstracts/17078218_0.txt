AIM: To define efficacy of splenectomy (SE) in current programmed therapy of aplastic anemia (AA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SE efficacy was analysed in 2 stages: a retrospective study of efficacy of surgery as monotherapy (1986-1996) (74 AA patients) and of SE in programs of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (1991-2002). Program treatment of AA patients was conducted on the base of IST algorithm developed in Hematological Research Center after many year investigations. RESULTS: SE as monotherapy improved AA course in 73.3% patients with non-severe AA (NAA) and 18.2% patients with severe AA (SAA). Three and five year survival in NAA postsplenectomy patients was 80%. One-year survivors after surgery were likely to survive long. Overall survival of SAA after SE was significantly less (p < 0.0001): 3-year survival - 6%. SE efficacy in programs including antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) and cyclosporin A (CsA) was studied in 69 AA patients. A 85.5% response was registered to program treatment including ALG, CsA and SE, being 81% in SAA and 1% in NAA patients. Efficacy of SE in combination with CsA at the first stage NAA treatment (a 30% positive response) was much inferior to ALG+CsA (68% response). At stage two treatment SE improved treatment results in most of SAA patients. Long-term survival in SAA patients after program treatment with SE is 60%. CONCLUSION: SE in the program of combined therapy in adult AA patients including CsA is an alternative to ALG in NAA patients. In SAA, SE can be included in the program at the first stage in ALG intolerance or in the absence of the drug, at the second stage--to overcome resistance to conducted therapy.
