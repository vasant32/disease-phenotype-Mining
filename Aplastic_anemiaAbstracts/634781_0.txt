The etiology of aplastic anemia is unknown. A stem cell lesion caused by a toxic or a virus or a microenvironment defect are the main hypothesis. An auto-immune origin has been recently suspected but never proved. To demonstrate the auto-immune origin of the disease. We have treated 17 patients with severe aplastic anemia with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). Nine patients showed no improvement and seven patients died within two months of infectious or hemorrhagic complications. In contrast, eight patients had a prompt rise of granulocytes and reticulocytes counts. Although the hematological reconstitution is not complete. This eight patients are still alive between 4 months and 15 months after treatment. This study shows that A.L.G. may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia.
