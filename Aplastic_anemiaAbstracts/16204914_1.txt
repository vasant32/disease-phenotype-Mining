Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is an uncommon variant seen in young, previously healthy individuals. The pancytopenia follows hepatitis by a few weeks and is usually severe and prolonged. Bone marrow transplantation remains the cornerstone of therapy. However, immunosuppressive therapy has been found to be effective. We report an 8-year-old girl who had non-A, B, C and E hepatitis-associated severe aplastic anemia. She became transfusion-independent and had consistent, albeit incomplete recovery after immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine.
