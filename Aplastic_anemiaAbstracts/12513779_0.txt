In order to evaluated the curative effect of rhIL-11 (Mega) on thrombocytopenia in chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) patients, ten CAA cases with thrombocytopenia after administration of conventional drugs were selected and subcutaneously injected 0.75 mg Mega per day in 1 - 2 courses of treatment on the basis of conventional therapy. Results showed that platelet counts were obviously increased and the bleeding symptoms were alleviated in all CAA patients after application of Mega for treatment. In conclusion, the rhIL-11 (Mega) could be used as an effective drug for treatment of thrombocytopenia in CAA patients.
