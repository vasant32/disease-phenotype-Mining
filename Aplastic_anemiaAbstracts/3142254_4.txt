We describe two patients who developed aplastic anemia early in the course of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Spontaneous rapid recovery of bone marrow function occurred in both patients. Although early bone marrow transplantation has been recommended as the treatment of choice in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, these patients illustrate the need for a period of expectant observation before undertaking bone marrow transplantation in such patients.
