OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of interleukin-8 in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA) and its correlation with clinical status. METHODS: Serum level of IL-8 in 24 AA patients and 20 normal controls was measured by sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). RESULTS: The levels of IL-8 were increased significantly(P < 0.05) in AA patients than in normal controls, and the IL-8 levels in severe AA group were much higher than those in chronic AA group (P < 0.05). Serum IL-8 in AA patients with infection were elevated significantly(P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: IL-8 may have a potential role in the pathogenesis of AA and determination of serum IL-8 may be helpful for evaluation of severity and infectious complication of AA.
