Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) are effective therapies in aplastic anemia; their mechanism of action is undefined. We assayed multiple properties of ATG and ALG to address the biological and immunological bases for differences between ATG and ALG and lot variation. In addition, we studied a lot reported to be inactive in an American clinical trial; however in retrospect, this lot appeared to be active in patients treated in Europe. Immunoprecipitation of thymocyte and lymphocyte membrane proteins with ATG and ALG showed between 14 and 18 major bands on SDS-PAGE, but the patterns for ATG and ALG were not identical. The ability of ATG and ALG to block binding of labeled monoclonal antibodies was assessed using flow cytometry and a radioimmunoassay. In general, there was more lot variation among ALGs than ATGs; however, all ALG lots were more potent blockers of binding of anti-HLA-DR and anti-Leu 1 antibodies than was ATG. Both ALG and ATG effectively blocked binding of anti-Leu 2a, anti-Leu 3a, anti-Leu 4, anti-Leu 5b, and anti-IL 2 receptor abs; neither blocked binding of anti-Leu 7. All preparations were capable of inducing T-cell blastogenesis, although there was considerable lot variation. All lots lysed 60% to 75% T cells in a rabbit complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay, with most having a plateau of activity at 5 to 10 ug/mL. Two lots of ALG, including the lot reported to be clinically inactive, showed less toxicity at suboptimal concentrations and did not plateau even at 80 ug/mL. In total, these results indicate important differences between ATG and ALG in general, more lot variation among ALGs than ATGs and only differences in cytotoxicity between an "inactive" lot of ALG and most, but not all, other active ATG and ALG preparations.
