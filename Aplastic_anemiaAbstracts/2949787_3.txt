Cyclosporine A (CyA) treatment of 4 patients with severe aplastic anemia, who were ineligible for bone marrow transplantation, was carried out for periods of between 12 weeks to 20 months. A normalization of Hb and bone marrow, together with a marked improvement in WBC and platelet counts, were observed in only one of these four patients. The remission was maintained for 20 months under continuous treatment. A relapse occurred only when the patient himself interrupted treatment. No serious side effects were observed with CyA doses of 4-10 mg/kg/daily and blood concentrations of 200-400 ng/ml. No significant changes in T helper/T suppressor ratios were noted during the course of CyA treatment.
