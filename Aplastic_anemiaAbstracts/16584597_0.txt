The objective of this study was to investigate the status of bone marrow angiogenesis in aplastic anemia (AA). Bone marrow specimens from 32 patients with AA and 16 normal controls were studied. The number of bone marrow microvessels was examined by means of immunohistochemical staining for CD34. Determination of microvessel density (MVD) and angiogenesis grading were done in a blinded manner. The results showed that the bone marrow MVD in patients with AA was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (P < 0.01). MVD in patients with severe and moderate AA was lower than that in control group, respectively (P < 0. 01). There is significant MVD difference between severe AA and moderate AA (P < 0.05). Angiogenesis grade and MVD in AA were positively correlated (r = 0.64, P < 0.01). It is concluded that bone marrow angiogenesis in AA patients is lower than that in normal controls. Defect of angiogenesis in bone marrow may play a role resulting in or aggravating hematopoietic aplasia in patients with AA.
