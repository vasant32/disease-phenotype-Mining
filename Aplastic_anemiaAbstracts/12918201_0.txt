Specific features of dilatation tracheostomy (DTS) were studied in 45 patients with hemorrhagic syndrome; 37 of them had thrombocytopenia; 6 patients had thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); and 2 patients had congenital coagulopathy. Besides, there were patients, among the examined ones, with hemoblastosis (36), with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (1), with aplastic anemia (1), with HELLP-syndrome (1), with diabetes mellitus (1), with rheumatoid arthritis, with stomach cancer (2) and with hemophilia A (2). Commercial sets were made use of for DTS ("Portex"). DTS can be safely made provided the blood platelets' level is not below 40-50 x 10(9), and the time of bleeding is below 3 min; in hemophilia, the procedure is possible after the administration factor's preparations; and in DIC--after plasma transfusion and after ensuring the normal coagulation. Obturation of lumens of the trachea and bronchi with blood grumes is an often complication in DTS, which makes it necessary to make bronchoscopy immediately after DTS.
