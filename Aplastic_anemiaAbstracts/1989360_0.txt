During 1980-1988 bone marrow transplantation was performed in 14 patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia. Twelve of these patients had HLA identical and two patients incompatible family donors. Two patients died before marrow engraftment. Twelve patients engrafted 12-30 days after marrow transplantation with continued normal marrow function. The actuarial probability for long term survival was found to be 67% after HLA identical allogeneic sibling marrow transplantation. The longest time of observation was 9 years and the patient is still alive. All deaths occurred during the first six months posttransplant. It is concluded that the serious prognosis for patients with SAA has improved if the patients have the possibility for allogeneic HLA identical family donor transplantation.
