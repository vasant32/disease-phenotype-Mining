With a newly developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit TOYOBO Co. in which 2 anti-EPO monoclonal antibodies were used, we assayed EPO concentration in sera from normal adults, 168 patients with renal failure and 333 patients with hematological disorders. In the patients with renal failure, serum EPO level was normal (52.9%) or reduced (42.9%), and there was no correlation to their hematocrits. However, there was an increment in EPO concentration correlated to their severity of anemia in the most patients with hematological disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia (correlation coefficient r = -0.74), aplastic anemia (r = -0.89), leukemia (r = -0.81), and MDS (r = -0.65). On the other hand, EPO concentration in sera from all the untreated patients with polycythemia vera were significantly low level. But the concentrations of EPO from the patients successfully treated, with normal hematocrit were recovered to normal level. In the patients with secondary polycythemia, there were much varieties in EPO level. Assay of EPO in blood is important not only for diagnosis of polycythemia but also for the analysis of anemia and clinical use of EPO in vivo. The method described here is accurate and technically not complicated, and could be widely induced in most laboratories.
