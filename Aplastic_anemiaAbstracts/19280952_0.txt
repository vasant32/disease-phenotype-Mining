We report a 73-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed Sweet's disease after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). Coronary angiography showed severe 3 vessel disease. We conducted OPCAB on triple vessels using bilateral internal thoracic artery and saphenous vein grafts. He had a high fever and rubor around the median skin incision on 5 postoperative day. Skin biopsy demonstrated acute febrile neutrophilic dermatitis (Sweet's disease). The cutaneous lesions improved gradually by corticosteroids. A careful attention should be paid postoperatively in a patient with hematological disorders such as MDS, aplastic anemia, and malignancy.
