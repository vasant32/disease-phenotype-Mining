The function of bone marrow (BM) stromal thrombopoietin (TPO) in megakaryopoiesis remains unknown. In the present study we attempted to clarify the pathophysiological implications of stromal TPO in normal subjects (NS) and in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), aplastic anemia (AA), and essential thrombocythemia (ET) by measuring TPO concentrations in BM and peripheral blood (PB) and by estimating the levels of stromal TPO mRNA with TaqMan fluorescence-based post-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product detection system. The results showed that TPO concentrations in PB were significantly elevated in patients with ITP (34.9 +/- 11.7 pg/mL) and AA (364.1 +/- 153.5 pg/mL) but within normal range in patients with ET (each 20.0 and 22.1; NS, 22.1 +/- 8.2 pg/mL). In all subjects, the TPO concentrations in BM correlated well with the PB levels, and the former were consistently higher than the latter. The concentrations of TPO in BM also correlated with the levels of TPO mRNA in stromal cells. Furthermore, expression levels of TPO mRNA clearly correlated with megakaryocyte counts in NS and patients with ITP, indicating that stromal TPO actually enhances megakaryopoiesis. Thus, our results in the present study indicate that TPO from BM stromal cells is considered to play an essential role for megakaryopoiesis under various patho-physiological conditions.
