A 27-year-old woman previously diagnosed of aplastic anemia secondary to treatment with gold salts for rheumatoid arthritis, presented with an episode of intestinal occlusion with acute renal failure. A CT scan revealed dilated intestinal loops, thickening of the ileum wall without cecal involvement, and multiple punctuate lesions (micro-abcesses) of liver, spleen and kidneys. At laparotomy, one meter of proximal jejunum was resected. The cultures of jejunal biopsy specimens yielded Torulopsis glabrata. The patient underwent multiorgan failure and died on the 8th postoperative day.
