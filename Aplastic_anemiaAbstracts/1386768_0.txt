In this paper, the Syndrome Differentiation in TCM and the determination on T-lymphocyte subpopulation and RBC C3b receptor were carried out by using indirect SPA assay and RBC C3b receptor ring test among 51 chronic aplastic anemia patients. Result: The OKT3, OKT4 and OKT4/OKT8 ratio in groups of Kidney-Yin Deficiency group were lower, while the OKT8 was higher than that of controls. In the group of both Kidney-Yin and Yang Deficiency, OKT4 and OKT4/OKT8 ratio were lower. and the value of OKT8 is higher than that of controls. The OKT8 in the Kidney-Yang Deficiency group was higher. and the ratio of OKT4/OKT8 was lower than that of controls. The OKT8 in the Kidney-Yin Deficiency group among three groups increased higher than that of other two groups. while the OKT4/OKT8 ratio reduced. The OKT4/OKT8 ratio in the group of both Kidney-Yin and Yang Deficiency was higher than that of Kidney-Yang Deficiency group. Among the three groups, the rosette rates of RBC C3b receptor were lower than controls. The above-mentioned data were statistically significant. These characteristic changes could be used as a reference of microcosmic Syndrome Differentiation and also a guide for how to apply the immunosuppressant and immunopotentiator.
