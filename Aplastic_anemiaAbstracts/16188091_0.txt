 OBJECTIVE: To delineate the immune regulatory pathway of benzene poisoning by using gene expression profile analysis. METHODS: Peripheral white blood cell gene expression profile of 7 benzene poisoning patients, including one aplastic anemia, was determined by microarray. Seven chips from normal workers were served as controls. Cluster analysis of gene expression profile was performed. Differentially expressed immune genes associated with benzene poisoning were determined. RESULTS: Among the 2 779 target genes, 38 genes differentially expressed were identified, including 10 up-regulated genes such as CD59, TRA@, MCP etc, and 14 down-regulated genes such as HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1, ITGB2, PFC etc. Cluster analysis showed that the expression profiles of 38 genes were associated with benzene poisoning. CONCLUSION: Differentially expressed immune genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of benzene poisoning.
