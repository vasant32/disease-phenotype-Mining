Optimal management of aplastic anemia (AA) is not confined to immediate diagnosis, early decision making and timely initiation of major treatment strategies (immunosuppression or SCT) but also involves supportive treatment as a crucial part of patient care. Patients are threatened by complications of cytopenia. Here, we summarize current recommendations for prevention and early treatment of fungal, bacterial and viral infections, transfusion strategy and iron chelation and assess the evidence basis. In fact, many recommendations for patients with AA are not based on randomized studies in AA itself, but they are deduced from other conditions with similar severity of cytopenia. Prevention and treatment of complications like hemorrhage, bacterial and fungal infections and of secondary events like alloimmunization to blood products and iron overload have a significant impact on the prognosis of AA patients and need to be carefully observed in daily practice. More controlled studies on supportive care should be performed in this rare disease.
