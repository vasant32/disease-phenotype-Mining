Aplastic anaemia can coincide with non-A-E hepatitis. Treatment follows a standardised study protocol of the German Society of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology (GPOH). Patients receive immunosuppression and/or bone marrow transplantation. We present six cases of aplastic anaemia after non-A-E hepatitis with different courses. In four of these children illness first presented with acute gastroenteritis. Five out of six children fully recovered, two of these with immunosuppression alone, three after bone marrow transplantation. One patient died due to complications of the bone marrow transplantation. In two patients steroid therapy was carried out to treat the hepatitis. This did not have any effect on the course of their aplastic anemia. We emphasise this common combination of aplastic anemia following non-A-E hepatitis. This overview underlines the necessity of regular blood testing after non-A-E hepatitis. Often gastroenteritis seems to precede illness thus perhaps indicating an infectious trigger.
