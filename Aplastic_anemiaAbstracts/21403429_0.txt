We investigated the hematopoietic status of aplastic anemia with FDG-PET before and after immunosuppressive therapy. FDG-PET showed a patchy uptake pattern before treatment, indicating residual compensatory hypercellular marrow. Three years after successful treatment with ATG plus CsA, the heterogeneity of bone marrow uptake persisted, suggesting that expanded reconstitution of hematopoiesis may require a long time even after the achievement of hematological remission.
