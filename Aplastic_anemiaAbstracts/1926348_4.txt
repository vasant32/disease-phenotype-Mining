After bone marrow transplantation many T-lymphocyte functions, including the production of cytokines (CK), such as interleukin 2, are severely depressed for months. The monocyte-derived cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 are molecules central to immune functions. Moreover, they may be involved in graft-versus-host disease and in graft-versus-leukemia reaction. Hence, we have studied the reappearance of these CKs after BMT by analyzing whole blood cultures stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide for 6 hr, followed by testing for the secretion of TNF in the WEHI 164/actinomycin D cytotoxicity bioassay and for IL-6 in the 7 TD 1 proliferation assay. We performed sequential studies in 6 children who were transplanted for aplastic anemia or leukemia with allogeneic bone marrow. We found that the production of both CKs can be induced as early as 10-14 days post BMT at the very beginning of engraftment, indicating that the regenerating monocyte system is recovering rapidly after BMT. Depletion and neutralization experiments confirmed that monocytes are the cellular source of the LPS-induced CK secretion after BMT. Control levels were reached 3 to 4 weeks post BMT. When analyzing the endotoxin-induced CK production in a larger panel of BMT patients after complete reconstitution, we could not detect any impact of acute or chronic GvHD, or of allogeneic or autologous BMT, nor did treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) show any suppressive effect. Thus, our data show that the CK production of the monocyte/macrophage lineage is quite resistant to factors that do influence other cell lineages of the immune system during BMT. The coincident appearance of monocyte-derived cytokines and of GvHD suggests a role for these cytokines in GvHD in man.
