 BACKGROUND: The prevalence of GB virus C (GBV-C)/HGV is high in individuals with parenteral risk factors. The frequency of GBV-C/HGV in blood donors is significantly lower, however it is still far above other parenterally transmitted viruses like HBV and HCV. Therefore, transmission routes apart from parenteral transmission must be considered. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV in blood donors and relatives of GBV-C/HGV-positive and -negative blood donors. Prevalence was also analyzed in aplastic anemia patients. Samples were tested by RT-PCR and partially by ELISA. Positive isolates were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 5733 blood donors were PCR tested and 90 were positive (1.6%). Of these, 98 relatives could be tested. Viremia was found in 14.3 percent and anti-E2 in 29.5 percent, whereas only 1.1 percent of the relatives of PCR-negative donors were viremic and 8.5 percent were anti-E2 positive. Probable virus transmission could be shown in two couples and in six mother-child pairs by sequencing of isolates indicating horizontal and vertical virus transmission, respectively. Recipients of GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive blood products were shown to be infected at a rate of 58 percent (18/31). Aplastic anemia patients were positive at a rate of 32 percent (17/53). CONCLUSION: The high percentage of 14.3 percent of GBV-C/HGV PCR-positive relatives of GBV-C/HGV-positive blood donors suggests intrafamilial transmission. Sequence analyses revealed vertical and horizontal transmission. Although parenteral transmission is highly efficient for GBV-C/HGV (58% of recipients of GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive blood products and 32% of aplastic anemia patients), it appears that sexual and vertical transmission are the most common transmission routes.
