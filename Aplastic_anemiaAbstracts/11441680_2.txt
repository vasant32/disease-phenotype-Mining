OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical application of a microwave tissue coagulator at 2.45 GHz with a needle electrode customized for endometrial ablation. STUDY DESIGN: In a pilot clinical study, endometrial ablation was performed under intravenous thiopental anesthesia on five women suffering from hypermenorrhea caused by aplastic anemia (3), von Willebrand's disease (1) and a submucosal myoma (1) using a microwave tissue coagulator at 2.45 GHz. RESULTS: Four patients were amenorrheic after endometrial ablation. The patient with the submucosal myoma experienced minor menstrual bleeding. No notable complications were observed during or after ablation. CONCLUSION: Endometrial ablation using a microwave tissue coagulator at 2.45 GHz is a simple and useful method of treating hypermenorrhea.
