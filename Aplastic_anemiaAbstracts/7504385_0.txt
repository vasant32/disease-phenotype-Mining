Fifteen patients with various myeloid and lymphoid neoplasias after receiving highly myelotoxic chemotherapy were treated with a single daily dose of 5 micrograms/kg of GM-CSF. G-CSF at a daily dose of 5-8 micrograms/kg was used in four patients with severe pancytopenia in the course of acute or chronic lymphoid leukemia treated with cytotoxic agents, and in two patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia. The administration of cytokines was provided for 4-10 days GM-CSF increased the WBC in twelve out of fifteen patients, mainly because of an increase in the number of neutrophils. Six patients receiving GM-CSF demonstrated rapid platelet recoveries. The rapid increase of the WBC was observed in all G-CSF treated patients. In one patient with aplastic anemia the WBC/ANC decreased rapidly to the initial values after the cessation of the G-CSF therapy. Fast platelet recovery was seen in three patients treated with G-CSF.
