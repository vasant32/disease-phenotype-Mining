Forty-eight cases of acquired aplastic anemia in children were analyzed in comparison to 26 cases of genetic aplastic anemia and 483 cases of aplastic anemia in adults. All were gathered from similar institutions and all were similarly followed and treated with androgens. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) Initial severity is greater in children than in adults, and is greater in acquired than in genetic aplastic anemia; 2) even in cases of similar initial severity, the early death rate is higher in children than in adults; 3) a multiparametric index allows the correct prediction of short-term evolution in 70% of the cases and thus aids in providing an indication for bone marrow graft; its sensitivity is similar to that of the classical parameters proposed by Camitta, et al., but its specificity significantly higher; 4) most deaths occurred during the first 3-4 months and the chance for long-term improvement appears similar in the more severe than in the less severe cases if they survive this delay; 5) some data (relapse after androgen withdrawal and androgen-dependence and failure of corticoid therapy alone) suggest that androgen therapy in children is useful, as it is in adults, and that corticosteroids do not modify the course of the disease at its usual dosage (1 mg/kg/day); and 6) very few side effects, particularly concerning height, of androgens were noted in the survivors at adult age after long-term androgen therapy prescribed before puberty.
