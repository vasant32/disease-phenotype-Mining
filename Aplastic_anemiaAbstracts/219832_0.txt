The serologic response of chickens to infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and inclusion body hepatitis virus (IBHV) was analyzed. Inoculation at one day old with either IBDV or IBHV significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced levels of serum gamma-globulins at 4 weeks postinoculation. This response was not elicited by inoculation of IBDV together with IBHV. Birds with experimentally induced or naturally occurring hemorrhagic anemia syndrome (HAS) had serum proteins quantitatively and qualitatively changed from those of controls. Serum protein profiles did not coincide, however, in experimentally infected and naturally infected chickens. Among naturally infected chickens, those that were IBHV-positive upon culture had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower hematocrit values.
