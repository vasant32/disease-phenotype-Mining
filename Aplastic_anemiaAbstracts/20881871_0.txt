Chromosomal breakage investigation using diepoxybutane induction was carried out in 195 pediatric patients suspected with Fanconi anemia (FA). Chromosomal breakage evaluation showed 33 (17%) patients with classical FA, 9 (4%) with somatic mosaicism FA, (when at least 50% of the metaphases showed chromosomal breakage and radial figures), 25 (13%) with FA with high frequency of chromosomal breakage and without clinical features, and 128 (66%) with suspected FA but had no chromosomal breakage and clinical features of FA. Chromosomal breakage investigation is an important diagnostic tool for differentiating FA from idiopathic aplastic anemia.
