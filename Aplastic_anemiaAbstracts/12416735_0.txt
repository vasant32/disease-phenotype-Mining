In our previous study, approximately 60% of aplastic anemia (AA) and refractory anemia (RA) patients treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) showed a multilineage response. In this study, we analyzed the long-term follow-up of the multilineage responders (multi-R). In the follow-up analysis of 11 multi-R (6 AA and 5 RA), 10 patients (5 AA and 5 RA) were evaluable. The range of time from the start of treatment to the final contact was 50 to 125 months. Analysis of survival times revealed a significant difference between multi-R and non-multi-R among AA patients given this treatment (P = .016). One AA and 1 RA patient among the multi-R developed acute leukemia. Of 7 living multi-R, 3 AA and 2 RA patients did not need transfusion at final contact. Four of them maintained the target hemoglobin concentration of more than 11 g/dL for quality-of-life benefit. The findings suggested that this result is an important advantage of this treatment.
