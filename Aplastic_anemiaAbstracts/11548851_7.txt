We report two patients who developed atypical skin lesions caused by Curvularia sp. and Pseudallescheria boydii after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. The first patient (female, 18-year-old) had multiple hemorrhagic vesicles on day +30 after her second BMT for graft failure. Pseudallescheria boydii was isolated from a skin biopsy. The patient died of respiratory failure probably as a consequence of systemic fungal infection. The second patient (male, 9-year-old) developed an ecthyma gangrenosum-like lesion on his right palm on day +8. Curvularia sp. was isolated from a skin biopsy. Liposomal amphotericin was given to achieve a total dose of 30 mg/kg and followed by oral itraconazole until steroids were discontinued. The infection resolved completely and the patient has remained disease-free. We conclude that emerging fungal organisms such as those described in this report are increasingly recognized in this setting. Early recognition and biopsy of these cutaneous lesions will allow prompt initiation of therapy to prevent systemic infection.
