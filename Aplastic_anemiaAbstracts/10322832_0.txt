OBJECTIVE: To explore into the theoretical basis of Busui Shengxue Capsule (BSSXC) in treating chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Applying the techniques of cell culture and FACS to observe the bone marrow mononuclear, cells of 35 cases CAA before and after treatment. RESULTS: (1) BSSXC has the function of restoring the membrane receptors of IL-3, IL-6, IL-11 of hematopoietic stem cell. (2) The treatment effect of BSSXC is better than Western medicine. (3) In treatment group, to stimulate the hematopolietic stem cell with IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, the rate of cell colony forming unit and CD34+ cell were obviously different between Yang Deficiency type and Yin Deficiency type before treatment (P < 0.05). After treatment the difference between these two types was also obvious (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: BSSXC could improve the membrane receptor of hematopoietic stem cell acted by hematopoietic stimulating factors.
