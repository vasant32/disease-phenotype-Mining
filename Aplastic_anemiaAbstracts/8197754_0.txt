87 patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in Innsbruck between 1983 and 1992. 81 patients were suffering from hematologic malignancies and severe aplastic anemia and six patients had advanced solid tumours/sarcoma. 56% of the patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling BMT were in an advanced or refractory stage of disease at the time of BMT. 19 patients underwent autologous BMT and 5 patients received a graft from an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Patients were treated with standard conditioning regimens according to the underlying disease. Cyclosporine A (CsA) was given prophylactically against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) either alone or in combination with methotrexate. Probability of survival for patients transplanted in the first chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was 85%, whereas the disease free survival (DFS) for patients transplanted in accelerated phase or blast crisis was only 40%. DFS for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) standard-risk (i.e., first or second complete remission) was 71% and 60%, respectively. All patients transplanted for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease had refractory or advanced disease. Probability of survival for lymphoma patients was 60%. Acute GVHD > grade II developed in 35% of patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling BMT (46% in the high-risk group vs. 21% in the standard-risk group). Main causes of death in the high-risk group were relapse (31%), severe bacterial or fungal infections (17%), interstitial pneumonia (11%) and acute GVHD (6%).
