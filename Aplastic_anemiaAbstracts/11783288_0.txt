OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Yishen Shengxue Tablet (YSSXT) in treating aplastic anemia. METHODS: Observing the effect of YSSXT on hematopoietic, immunologic, anti-infection and body resistance of model mice of aplastic anemia. RESULTS: YSSXT had marked effect of promotion on recovering myleran injury induced reduction of colony forming unit-spleen (CFU-S), colony forming unit-culture (CFU-C), colony forming unit-erythrocyte (CFU-E), markedly promoting the peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis of normal mice, also markedly lower the mortality of Staphylococcus aureus inoculated mice, and elevate the anoxia resistant ability under normal pressure of anoxic mice, prolonging their survival time. CONCLUSION: Using YSSXT to treat aplastic anemia that the effectiveness might be realized through promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells of bone marrow, enhancing the non-specific immunity, and the anti-infection as well as body resistance.
