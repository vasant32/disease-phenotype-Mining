From March 1984 through November 1985, 24 children and adults with aplastic crises were admitted in several Parisian hospitals. Twelve patients had known hemolytic anemia. Aplastic crisis revealed hemolytic anemia in the remaining patients. The detection of human parvovirus antigen was performed by counter-immunoelectrophoresis, and specific IgM antibodies were detected by IgM-antibody-capture-radioimmunoassay, in order to establish the incidence of human parvovirus infection in the genesis of the aplastic crisis. Twenty-one patients had acute infection with human parvovirus. In the three remaining patients, no marker of human parvovirus infection was found. The features of the human parvovirus linked aplastic crisis are described. We consider that human parvovirus infection, and unknown hemolytic anemia, must be systematically researched in any case of unexplained acute aplastic anemia.
