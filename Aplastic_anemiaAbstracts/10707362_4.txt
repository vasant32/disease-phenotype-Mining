The present study was performed to analyze the relationship between underlying diseases and the morphologic form of aspergillosis. This retrospective analysis of 3284 autopsies yielded 18 cases of aspergillosis. The specific diagnosis of aspergillosis was rendered by a monoclonal antibody versus Aspergillus spp. Patients with hematological disorders, such as acute leukemia and aplastic anemia, made up about 35% of all patients dying of invasive aspergillosis. Diseases of the airways and the pulmonary parenchyma constituted the second most pathogenetic factor for the development of aspergillosis. The morphologic form of aspergillosis was closely related to the underlying diseases. Non- and semi-invasive forms of aspergillosis--saprophytic infection and chronic necrotizing aspergillosis--were observed only in patients with an isolated underlying pulmonary disease devoid of any other precipitating factor. In contrast, seven patients, five of whom suffered from hematological diseases, had no underlying lung disease and developed aspergillus pneumonia. The remaining 5 patients with aspergillus pneumonia showed a combination of underlying extrapulmonary disease and pulmonary alterations that preceded aspergillosis. The local distribution of fungal infection showed a characteristic distribution pattern with a predominance of the upper lung lobes. Hematogeneous spread beyond the lungs occurred exclusively in cases with aspergillus pneumonia. We conclude that the different forms of aspergillosis are closely related to the nature of the underlying disease.
