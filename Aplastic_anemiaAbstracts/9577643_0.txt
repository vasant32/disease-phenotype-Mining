We report two cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) after allogenic bone marrow transplantation which were conditioned with regimens including antithymocyte globulin (ATG). The first case was a 31 year-old man which severe aplastic anemia who was transplanted from HLA-matched unrelated donor conditioned with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)/ cyclophosphamide/ATG and prophylactic administration of ganciclovir Grade I acute GVHD improved in response to cyclosporine (CsA). LPD as a polyclonal epipharyngeal mass developed at day +53 and spontaneously regressed along with the withdrawal of CsA. Second case was a 11 year-old boy with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB:M4E). He was transplanted from HLA B locus mismatched mother conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI)/busulfan/L-PAM/ATG. He showed grade IV acute GVHD, which was controlled by steroids and FK-506. LPD as a monoclonal intestinal lymphoma was diagnosed at day +82, and he was unsuccessfully treated with ganciclovir, acyclovir, chemotherapy and transfusions of EBV-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in addition to discontinuation of immunosuppressants, and died at day +18 due to sepsis and multiple cerebral infarction. Early detection and introduction of appropriate treatment for post bone marrow transplantation LPD is necessary.
