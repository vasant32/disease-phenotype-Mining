We present a case of extreme pancytopenia in a 27-year-old pregnant woman. The initial picture was compatible with a severe hematological problem in the category of aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or even acute leukemia. The further biochemical investigations revealed, however, a folate deficiency. Nowadays this is a very rare cause of pancytopenia. Next to this she also had a Vitamin B(12) deficiency due to intrinsic factor failure. The recent literature is discussed.
