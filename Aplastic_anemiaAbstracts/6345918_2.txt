Eleven adults have been transplanted for various reasons between July 1979 and July 1982: 2 with aplastic anemia (AA), 1 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), 8 with acute leukemia (AL). Four patients suffered from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and four from acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Two of them were transplanted in relapse, 1 in a partial remission, and 5 in complete remission. All patients were in their late stage of disease. The PNH-patient had an identical twin, 8 patients had an HLA- and MLC compatible sib, 1 an unrelated donor, and 1 was transplanted from his father. Four patients are alive, 2 more than 3 years: 1 with AA and 1 with ALL who was transplanted in relapse. Six patients died of infectious complications (4 of interstitial pneumonia, 1 of a candida sepsis, 1 of acute toxoplasmosis). Patients living more than 3 weeks had a take. Acute graft-versus-host (GvH) disease did not present a major problem. All patients received methotrexate for GvH-prophylaxis, in three instances the marrow was additionally pre-incubated with anti-T-cell globulin.
