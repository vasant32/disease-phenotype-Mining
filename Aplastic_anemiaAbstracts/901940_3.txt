A genetic mutation in mice (W/Wv) causes an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypoplastic anemia which lasts throughout life. Double-dominant W/Wv anemic mice were sublethally irradiated to facilitate repopulation of marrow with transplanted cells and were injected intravenously with suspensions of 5-10 million placental cells of 15 days gestation derived from normal, isogeneic donors. Red cell counts fell promptly after irradiation and then rose progressively over a period of weeks, reaching normal levels of the nonmutant. Mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin electrophoresis patterns of red cells in recipient W/Wv mice resembled those of normal donor animals. The therapeutic effect lasted for the duration of the observation period, in some instances over 9 mo. W/Wv mice that were administered Hanks' solution or fetal blood, instead of placental transplants, remained anemic. Late gestation placentas (18 days) were also ineffective.
