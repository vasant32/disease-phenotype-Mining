Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAA) has been reported to show a successful outcome following immunosuppressive treatment. On the other hand, the long-term prognosis of HAA has not been sufficiently clarified. Herein we report a patient with HAA who had been treated with cyclosporine for one year, and maintained complete remission without treatment. Ten years later, acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis reccurred followed by bone marrow aplasia. A second immunosuppressive treatment with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine was effective. This case might provide useful information for the long-term follow-up of patients with HAA.
