 OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effect of combined therapy with Chinese drugs and immuno-suppressors, mainly anti-lymphocyte globulin/anti-thymus globulin (ALG/ATG), for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA), the efficacy associated factors and adverse effects as well. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with SAA treated by combined therapy which was supplemented with cyclosporin A, androgen, hematopoietic growth factor, etc. RESULTS: Of the 57 patients followed-up, 26 (45.6%) were basically cured, 15 (26.3%) remitted, and 8 (14.0%) improved markedly, the total effective rate being 85.9%. By separately comparing with a single item of clinical data, it was shown that the therapeutic effectiveness was correlated, to a certain extent, with age, illness duration, neutrophil count, and bone marrow proliferation in patients before treatment, as well as with infection that occurred in the follow-up period. It was obviously higher in patients with peripheral neutrophil count > 0.5 x 10 10(9)/L (P<0.05). Various degrees of serum sickness-like reactions occurred in the treatment of 36 patients, including fever in 36 (63.2%), skin rash in 8 (14.0%), and musculoskeletal pain in 5 (8.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of combined therapy with Chinese drugs and ALG/ATG in treating SAA could be affirmed, showing some superiority as compared with Western medicine alone. The patients' age, duration of illness, neutrophil count, and bone marrow proliferation before treatment, and degree of infection that occurred could affect the therapeutic efficacy to a certain extent. Adverse reactions resulting from the combined therapy are less, showing the toxicity reducing and effect enhancing action of Chinese drugs.
