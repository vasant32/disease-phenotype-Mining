 BACKGROUND: Pure red cell aplasia and moderate aplastic anemia are marrow failure states with an immune pathogenesis. Previously, we described short-term improvements in blood counts in two pilot studies treating moderate aplastic anemia (mAA) and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) patients with daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin-2 receptor; we now report our long-term experience with a larger cohort of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: After a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 19 of 45 (42%) evaluable mAA patients and 10 of 26 (38%) patients with PRCA responded by three months and 2 additional mAA patients responded by six months following administration of the drug. RESULTS: Seven of 28 (25%) mAA patients achieved long-term packed red blood cell PRBC transfusion independence, and all PRCA responders achieved long-term transfusion PRBC transfusion independence. CONCLUSIONS: Red cell transfusion-independence prior to treatment in mAA patients predicted response. The only significant adverse treatment-related events were transient rashes and arthralgias. Daclizumab is safe and effective, and produces lengthy remissions in patients with PRCA and mAA.
