Severe aplastic anemia has an elevated mortality if treatment is unsatisfactory. Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice in adults, comparable with allogeneic bone marrow transplant in children. We report two adult patients (both males, aged 59 and 67 years old) who were treated successfully with lymphoglobulin and cyclosporine. The initial response started within 3 months of treatment and was almost complete after 2 years, when cyclosporine was stopped. After three years, both patients have almost normal blood counts, with minor sequels: avascular necrosis of both femoral heads due to the use steroids, that recovered spontaneously in 1 patient and reduced vision due to thrombocytopenic retinal hemorrhages, in the other.
