Of 27 patients with hypoplastic anemia treated between 1971 and 1974 with male hormone and protein-assimilating hormone, 3 developed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (SSST). The clinical symptoms and signs and angiographic findings of SST were characteristic enough to allow an early diagnosis. Signs related to SST were seizures, hemiplegia, facial palsy, stupor, and coma, with the most important prodrome and consistent subjective complaint being headache. Following discontinuation of the hormone therapy, neurological signs and symptoms related to SSST gradually subsided. In all cases, the hematological picture improved with discontinuation of the hormone therapies. It appears that administration of male hormone can be associated with the development of SSST. If neurological symptoms and signs of SSST appear, administration of the hormones should be discontinued.
