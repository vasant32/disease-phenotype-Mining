Reports are emerging of hematologic responses associated with iron chelation therapy; however, studies are limited in aplastic anemia patients. Deferasirox reduced iron overload in aplastic anemia patients enrolled in the EPIC study (n=116). A post-hoc analysis of hematologic responses was conducted on 72 patients with evaluable hematologic parameters (according to UK guideline criteria), 24 of whom received deferasirox without concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. Partial hematologic responses were observed in 11/24 (45.8%) patients; all became transfusion-independent. One patient had an additional platelet response and one patient had an additional platelet and hemoglobin response. Mean serum ferritin levels at end of study were significantly reduced in partial hematologic responders (n=11; 3948+/-4998 ng/mL; baseline 6693+/-7014 ng/mL; % change from baseline 45.7%, P=0.0029). In non-responders, the reduction in serum ferritin was less pronounced (n=13; 2021+/-3242 ng/mL; baseline 4365+/-3063 ng/mL; % change from baseline 27.6%, P=0.0171). Alongside reduction in iron overload, deferasirox may therefore improve hematologic parameters in a subset of aplastic anemia patients. Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00171821.
