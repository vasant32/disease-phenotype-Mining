BACKGROUND: A 2.5-year-old boy received a cadaveric orthotopic liver transplant for acute liver failure due to non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. After transplantation, he developed thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and subsequently severe aplastic anemia. The patient also suffered from recurrent cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, treated with foscarnet and ganciclovir. METHODS: For treatment of his aplastic anemia, the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-identical sister after conditioning with cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/kg and antithymocyte globulin at 3 mg/kg for 5 days. Prophylactic acyclovir was given because of ongoing CMV viremia at the time of bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: The transplant course was uneventful, with rapid engraftment. There were no signs of liver dysfunction, graft-versus-host disease, or reactivation of CMV. The patient is in excellent health, with normal liver and bone marrow function 3 years after bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: This case report shows that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is feasible and well tolerated in a patient with severe aplastic anemia after liver transplantation for acute fulminant viral hepatitis.
