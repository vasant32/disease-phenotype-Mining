Pancytopenia is a very rare condition associated with hepatitis A infection. We managed a 12 year old boy who had hepatitis A infection with anemia. His hemogram and bone marrow examination were suggestive of pancytopenia. Pancytopenia recovered without any specific therapy. There are case reports of severe aplastic anemia with hepatitis A infection that required immunosuppressive therapy. The present case did not require any aggressive therapy and recovered. In a young child with hepatitis A infection and anemia, bone marrow depression should be suspected. The pancytopenia may be transient as exemplified by the present case.
