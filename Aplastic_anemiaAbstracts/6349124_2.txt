Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) transfusion requirements during the first 13 weeks after HLA-identical marrow transplantation were studied in 82 patients with aplastic anemia. On the average, patients were given 9 units of RBCs (1-82) and 44 units of PLTS (6-468). The greatest need for support was during the first 4 weeks postgrafting. A multivariate statistical analysis of 22 variables showed that RBC and PLT requirements increased with age. In addition, RBC requirements increased if the patient had isohemagglutinins against the marrow donor's RBC, i.e., if the marrow transplant was across a major ABO barrier.
