OBJECTIVE: To explore the immunophenotype of myeloid cells in myelodysplastic syndromes and its clinical implications. METHODS: A panel of monoclonal antibodies was used to detect CD13, CD33, CD15 and CD14 on the membrane surfaces of myeloid cells in the bone marrow from 51 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 21 with aplastic anemia (AA), 21 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and 15 normal subjects, by immunoenzymatic assay. The morphology and chromosome karyotype of bone marrow cells of MDS patients were also examined. RESULTS: CD14+ cells, CD13+ cells and CD33+ cells in the bone marrow were more in MDS patients than in normal controls, AA patients and PNH patients. CD15+ cells in the bone marrow were less in MDS patients than in normal controls. The percentages of CD14, CD13 and CD33 positive cells in the bone marrow of MDS patients were related to the percentage of myeloblast, the chromosomal aberrations and the response to treatment. CONCLUSION: There was an immunophenotypic misexpression of myeloid cells in MDS patients. Immunophenotype analysis of myeloid cells might be useful for the diagnosis and directing treatment in MDS patients.
