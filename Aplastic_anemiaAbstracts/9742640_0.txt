AIM: To define optimal time for transplantation of bone marrow (TBM) in children with hematological malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 allogenic TBMs were performed in children with acute myeloblastic leukemia (6 patients, 2 of them in recurrence), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7 patients, 4 of them in recurrence), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a chronic stage (3 patients), severe aplastic anemia (3 patients), generalized neuroblastoma (1 patient). Pretransplantation preparation included cyclophosphamide and busulphane or cyclophosphamide, busulphane and vepezide. The graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) was prevented with cyclosporin A plus methotrexate or cyclosporin A plus urbazone. Engrafting was recognized by change of karyotype and blood group. RESULTS: From 13 children with acute leukemia subjected to TBM in a complete remission 4(33%) are alive, 5 died within 100 days after TBM (TBM was made in recurrence in 4 children), 3 patients died of recurrence 12 months after TBM. One patient with CML and one with severe aplastic anemia remain in remission. The main complications and causes of death in early posttransplantation period were hemorrhagic syndrome, infectious complications, GVHR. According to a one-year follow-up, the recurrent disease caused death most frequently. CONCLUSION: Positive result of TBM is related to the disease stage at transplantation.
