The authors describe the experience gained with 19 allogenic and autologous transplantations of the bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocytes, embryonal liver cells of man and syngeneic transplantation of the bone marrow to 15 patients with hemoblastoses and aplastic anemia. Non-medullary toxicity of the pretransplantation conditioning of the patients was moderate and could be successfully corrected. The clinical analysis of the complications and causes of the patients' death demonstrated an evident reduction of organ lesions as a result of the use of the common methods of preventing exo- and endogenous infections and early treatment of the complications. The authors describe an acute secondary disease as the main reason for death during the latest allogenic transplantations of the bone marrow and support the conclusion about the necessity of transplantation only in the cases with a satisfactory prognosis.
