Acute C hepatitis, compared with hepatitis A or B, may sometimes be associated with extrahepatic manifestations of a haematologic nature. The first case of hepatitis associated with aplastic anemia was reported by Lorenz in 1955. We observed a patient who developed acute hepatitis, associated with febrile purpura: pancytopenia was present, but not aplasia. This association is frequent in Flavivirus-related infections, like Dengue and Yellow Fever, and principally affects children and young people. HCV belongs to the Flavivirus family and so in this case clinical signs may have developed as a consequence of HCV infection.
