Classification of platelet disorders has been based on the platelet count. Addition of a second variable, mean platelet volume (MPV), to the routine blood count allows classification of patients into 9 categories: high, low, or normal MPV, and high, low or normal platelet count. We studied 1,244 adult inpatients. 1,134 had both platelet values normal. 11 patients had high MPV and low platelet count: all had hyperdestructive causes. 15 patients had high MPV and normal platelet count: 12 had heterozygous thalassemia, and three had iron deficiency. Seven patients had high MPV and high platelet count: causes included myeloproliferative disorders, inflammation, iron deficiency, and splenectomy, 25 patients had high platelet counts and normal MPV: the causes were inflammation, infection, sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency, or chronic myelogenous leukemia. 52 patients had an MPV that was inappropriately low for the platelet count (high, normal, or low). All had sepsis, splenomegaly, aplastic anemia, chronic renal failure, or a disease being treated with myelosuppressive drugs. High MPV thus appears correlated with myeloproliferative disease or thalassemia; and low MPV, with cytotoxic drugs or marrow hypoplasia. Addition of MPV to the platelet count allows subtler disorders to be detected (when the platelet count is normal), and allows distinction of the cause of thrombocytopenia.
