Erythropoietin measurements were performed in 2 patients with refractory hypoplastic anaemia who required regular blood transfusion. Erythropoietin levels varied inversely with the haemoglobin level consistent with the accepted role of erythropoietin in reflecting the adequacy of tissue oxygenation. A particularly step rise in erythropoietin occurred when the haemoglobin concentration fell below 8.0 g/dl. This coincided with the deterioration in clinical symptoms necessitating imminent admission for transfusion. Change from a regime involving a 5--6 unit transfusion every 6 weeks to that involving a regular 2 unit per 2 weeks transfusion resulted in a lower and more stable pattern of erythropoietin levels and was also associated with a considerable improvement in general well being.
