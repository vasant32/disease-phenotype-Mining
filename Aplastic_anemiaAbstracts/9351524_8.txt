The serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in 16 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), 12 with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), 10 with aplastic anemia (AA), 10 with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and 71 with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The serum TPO levels were measured with a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum TPO level in the ITP group (1.68 +/- 0.85 fmol/ml) were not significantly increased compared with those of the normal subjects. The TPO levels in the TTP (2.77 +/- 1.38 fmol/ml) and HUS groups (5.77 +/- 4.41 fmol/ml) were higher than those of the normal subjects. The patients with AA (12.7 +/- 8.0 fmol/ml) and those with DIC (13.3 +/- 5.7 mol/ml) had significantly higher serum TPO levels than did the normal subjects and ITP patients. The TPO levels were well correlated with the platelet counts in the TTP patients, and were negatively correlated with the platelet counts in the ITP patients. These results suggest that the serum TPO levels in some thrombocytopenic diseases are regulated not only by the platelet count and the megakaryocyte mass, but also by other factors.
