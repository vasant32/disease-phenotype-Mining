 AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
