Bone marrow transplantation is a major therapeutic approach for treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia or acute leukemia refractory to chemotherapy. It is possible only if an HLA matched sibing is found. ABO compatibility is not necessary. The conditionning regimen includes high doses of cyclophosphamide associated or not with a 1 000 rads total body irradiation. In acute leukemia, the two year percentage survival is 17%, in aplastic anemia it is 40%. Complications are immunologic : rejection, graft versus host disease and persistent severe immune deficiency.
