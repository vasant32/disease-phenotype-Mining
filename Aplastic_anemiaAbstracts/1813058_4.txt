A nationwide cooperative incidence survey of aplastic anemia (AA) was carried out from 1986 to 1988. The cooperative survey network covered 44 investigating areas, involving 21 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. More than 52 million person-years were supervised and 387 new cases identified. The annual incidence rate was 0.74/10(5) and the 95% confidence interval of the population rate ranged from 0.67/10(5) to 0.82/10(5). The incidence rate of AA in coal mines was higher than that in other areas. The incidence rate of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) was 0.60/10(5) and that of acute aplastic anemia (AAA) was 0.14/10(5). There were incidence peaks of CAA at older ages; at age 50-59 in females, but after 60 in males. The incidence rate of CAA in males decreased obviously at age 40-49 and that in females rose clearly at age 10-19, while the incidence rate of CAA in males was generally higher than that in females.
