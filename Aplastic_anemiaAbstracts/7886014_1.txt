A total of 41,553 bone marrow biopsies were collected for the Bone Marrow Registry from January 1989 to June 1994 included 6,366 taken from 5,011 patients referred because of unexplained anemia. An increasing percentage of biopsies submitted for examination are designated anemic: this rose from 7.2% in 1989 to 18.9% within the first 6 months of 1994, reflecting an increased need to find the reasons for anemic conditions. Histologically, seven main groups have been found: (1) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) accounting for 32% of all anemia patients seen, (2) infectious anemia (23.5%), (3) iron deficiency anemia ((22.7%), (4) hemolytic anemias (7.2%), (5) aplastic anemia (6.8%), (6) megaloblastic/pernicious anemia (5.0%), and (7) anemia due to bleeding (3.0%). These seven groups of anemia can be diagnosed in core biopsies on the basis of their particular histopathology, so that films of bone marrow smears are not always needed.
