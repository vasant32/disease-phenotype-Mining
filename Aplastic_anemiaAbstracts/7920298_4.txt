In Taiwan, a country with 21 million people, 388 bone marrow transplants (BMTs), 308 allografts and 80 autografts, were performed in 5 BMT centers from November 1983 to October 1993. The commonest indications were leukemia, aplastic anemia, lymphoma and thalassemia. Campaigns promoting an unrelated marrow donor registry were started in August 1993 and recruited approximately 26,000 volunteers. A peripheral stem cell program is just beginning. The overall results of BMT in Taiwan are comparable to other countries. The complications of BMT are similar to Western series, except that acute GVHD was rarer in one large series; this observation needs further study. A particular indication for allogeneic BMT in Taiwan is thalassemia, accounting for 10% of all patients. Disease-free survival after BMT for thalassemia is 44%; graft rejection is the major cause of treatment failure. Another important issue is the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in BMT, since the prevalence of HBV infection in Taiwan is very high (> 90%). Abnormal liver function is currently the most common complication and might be related to HBV. Among nearly 100 allogeneic BMTs with HBV carriers as either donor or recipient, 2 patients (approximately 2%) died of HBV-related hepatic failure. Whether the HBV status of the donor and recipient is an important prognostic factor remains to be defined.
