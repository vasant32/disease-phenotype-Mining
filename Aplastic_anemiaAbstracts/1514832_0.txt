Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling is increasingly used as a curative therapy for patients with hemopoietic stem cell disorders including acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and severe aplastic anemia. Between March 1983 and March 1991, we performed 86 cases of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for the patients with hemopoietic stem cell disorders: 25 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); 15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 20 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); and 26 severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Ten out of 25 AML are in disease free survival (DFS). The causes of death were recurrence of leukemia (12), acute GVHD (3), sepsis (1) and veno-occlusive disease (1). Nine of 15 ALL are in unmaintained remission. Thirteen out of 20 CML are in DFS. Among 26 SAA, 21 are enjoying DFS, but 1 died of engraftment failure, 3 of graft rejection followed by cytomegalovirus (1) and aspergillus pneumonia (1). Comparing the survival between standard [less than or equal to CR1: 9/14 (64%)] and high risk [greater than or equal to CR1: 1/11 (9%)] AML, our data suggest that preparative regimen for high risk AML was not potent enough to eradicate the minimal residual disease in advanced AML. Although our cases are limited and the follow-up period is short, our result of ALL [overall: CCR (60%), standard risk (adult less than or equal to CR1, children less than or equal to CR2; 8/11 (73%) and high risk; 1/4 (25%)] and CML [overall: 65%, CP; 9/10 (90%), AP; 4/6 (67%), BP; 0/4 (0%)] are optimistic. It is of our interest that the incidence of death related with IP (1/33: 3%) and with AGVHD 94/33: 12%) were much less than that of other's observation but the explanation for this still remains to be clear.
