 BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia (AA) complicated by menorrhagia is treated with transfusion and hormonal therapy. When bleeding is life-threatening, balloon endometrial ablation can safely be used to treat menorrhagia in selected patients. CASE: A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman was diagnosed with AA after several weeks of menorrhagia and pancytopenia. She became heavily alloimmunized after extensive platelet transfusion. During treatment with antithymocyte globulin, vaginal bleeding increased and the platelet count fell to 1,000/microl on supportive measures. After bleeding stopped with use of intravenous Premarin, she was examined in the operating room. There, a clot was removed and appeared to be a uterine caste; hemostasis continued. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a normal endometrial contour and thin endometrium; endometrial histology was benign. After she completed antithymocyte globulin and her platelet count could be maintained over 30,000/microl with matched platelets, endometrial ablation was performed without any complications. CONCLUSION: Thermal balloon endometrial ablation is an effective alternative to hysterectomy for women with persistent menorrhagia and AA when supportive measures fail. Prior to endometrial ablation, evaluation should ensure normal endometrial contour and histology, and that sufficient blood products are available to maintain platelet counts above 30,000/microl during the healing process.
