 PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatic adenoma (HA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1989 and June 2006, TACE was performed in seven patients with HA (five male and two female patients; mean age, 25 years). The therapeutic results were evaluated by reviewing the clinical records and radiologic studies. The causes of HA were hormonal therapy for aplastic anemia (n = 4) and glycogen storage disease type I (n = 2); in one patient, the cause was unknown. The presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 4) and lower-extremity edema (n = 1). Two patients had no symptoms at presentation. Rupture (n = 1) or impending rupture (n = 3) of the tumors was detected on computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained before TACE. Clinical results were assessed at subsequent TACE sessions and follow-up CT. The mean follow-up duration after the first TACE session was 88 months (range, 16-200 months). The change in tumor size at CT was measured to evaluate the therapeutic results. RESULTS: The preexisting symptoms were relieved and no procedural-related complications were observed in all patients. Hemostasis and no further bleeding episodes were achieved in patients with rupture or impending rupture with intratumoral hemorrhage. The treatment results were complete remission (n = 2), tumor regression in size by more than 50% (n = 4), and progression (n = 1) at follow-up CT. CONCLUSION: TACE is a feasible therapeutic modality for HA.
