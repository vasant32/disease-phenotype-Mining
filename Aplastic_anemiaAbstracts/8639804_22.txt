Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia, and cancer susceptibility. Mutations within the FA complementation group C (FAC) gene account for approximately 14% of diagnosed FA cases. Two mutations, one in exon 1 (delG322) and one in exon 4 (IVS4 + 4 A to T), account for 90% of known FAC mutations. The delG322 mutation results in a mild FA phenotype, while the IVS4 + 4 A to T mutation results in severe FA phenotype. To determine the molecular basis for this clinical variability, we analyzed patient-derived cell lines for the expression of characteristic mutant FAC polypeptides. All cell lines with the delG322 mutation expressed a 50-kD FAC polypeptides, FRP-50 (FAC-related protein), shown to be an amino terminal truncated isoform of FAC reinitiated at methionine 55. All cell lines with the IVS4 + 4 A to T mutation lacked FRP-50. Overexpression of a cDNA encoding FRP-50 in an FA(C) cell line resulted in partial correction of mitomycin C sensitivity. In conclusion, expression of an amino terminal truncated FAC protein accounts, at least in part, for the clinical heterogeneity among FA(C) patients.
