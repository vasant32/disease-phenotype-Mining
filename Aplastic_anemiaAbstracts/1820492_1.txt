This report underlines the occurrence of multiple early and late complications after allogeneic BMT. Most of these are caused by the conditioning regimen, and especially by the use of total body irradiation. This should discourage the use of radiation for patients with non-malignant disorders such as aplastic anemia. We have shown that interstitial pneumonia is greatly reduced after fractionated TBI, and this should also be considered when designing transplant protocols. Prolonged immunodeficiency post-BMT is responsible for a high rate of infections: this suggests that long-term prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be considered. Great attention should be given to the quality of life of long-term survivors: to this respect a specific program for monitoring and treating gonadal complication can be extremely useful.
