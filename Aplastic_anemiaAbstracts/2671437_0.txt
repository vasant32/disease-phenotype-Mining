Fifteen adult patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) received cyclosporine (CSP) as prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GVHD). In our patients eleven were hematologic malignancies, and four were severe aplastic anemia. Twelve patients were HLA-matched, and three were one locus mismatched. Three patients received CSP only, twelve received CSP and short term methotrexate. Seven patients had acute GVHD, but GVHD over Grade II were seen in only 3 patients who were transplanted from HLA-one locus mismatched donor. 7 patients had chronic GVHD. CSP were given intravenously at 3-5 mg/kg, starting 1 day before BMT. From about day 30, CSP was given orally. CSP concentrations when patients were given orally were lower in patients who had chronic GVHD. Although hypertension and water retention were seen in 8 patients, and renal dysfunction was seen in 3 patients, the side effects of CSP were mild and transient. There were no correlations between serum concentrations and the side effects of CSP. Three patients had the disturbance of hematopoiesis. Ten of fifteen patients are alive at median follow-up of 18.5 months (8-41 months) after BMT.
