Two children with severe and moderate aplastic anemia received combination treatment with methylprednisolone, antilymphocyte globulin and cyclosporine. One child (severe type) was given 2 courses of high dose methylprednisolone during the last 4 weeks without improvement prior to this combination therapy. The other child (moderate type) was not previously treated. Both patients showed complete response within 3 months following this therapy. Serious side effects were not observed. Combination therapy of these three drugs may be beneficial for patients with aplastic anemia.
