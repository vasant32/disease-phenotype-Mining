This report describes the results of marrow transplantation in four patients with aplastic anemia during the last trimester of their pregnancies. All patients were treated with supportive care until delivery. Because of persistent severe aplasia, marrow transplantation was then performed 1.6-11.0 months postpartum. Marrow donors were HLA-identical siblings. Although all were at increased risk for graft rejection because of their pregnancies as well as their long transfusion histories, two patients were successfully engrafted and now survive 12 and 95 months after transplant. The other two patients rejected their grafts despite attempts at second or third marrow infusions. Both died of infectious complications, 42 and 111 days after transplant.
