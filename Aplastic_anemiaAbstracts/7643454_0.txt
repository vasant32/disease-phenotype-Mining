We report a case of a 19-year-old male with congenital aplastic anemia and multiple abnormalities; short stature, hypoplastic thumb, skin pigmentation and mental retardation. He was admitted to our hospital because of severe pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration showed markedly hypocellular marrow with 42% myeloblasts. He was diagnosed as AML (M2) transformed from Fanconi's anemia and underwent allo-BMT from an HLA-identical father. The conditioning regimen consisted of high dose Ara-C, high dose etoposide and 12Gy fractionated total body irradiation. Severe toxicity associated with the conditioning regimen was not observed. Cyclosporin A and short-term methotrexate were administered for prophylaxis of acute GVHD. Neither acute nor chronic GVHD were observed. He is well and free of disease for 15 months since BMT. Very few cases of Fanconi's anemia with leukemic transformation treated by BMT have been reported. Long-term observation will be necessary to evaluate our conditioning regimen for Fanconi's anemia with leukemic transformation.
