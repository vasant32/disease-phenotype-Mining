Bone marrow transplantation is an established form of therapy for aplastic anemia and severe combined immunodeficiency. It is also a therapeutic option for acute leukemia in remission. Unfortunately, compatible donors are not available for most patients who could benefit from it. Further refinement of the techniques involved may make it suitable for more patients. Graft rejection, recurrent leukemia, graft-versus-host disease and interstitial pneumonia continue to be the main unsolved complications of bone marrow transplantation, but recent advances have decreased their frequency and severity. Most of the complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be eliminated with the use of autologous stem cells. For further refinement bone marrow transplantation should continue to be performed in large centres that combine treatment with research.
