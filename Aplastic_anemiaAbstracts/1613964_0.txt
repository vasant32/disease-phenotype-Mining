A 28-year-old female, weighing 46 kg, 155 cm in height, with aplastic anemia underwent implantation of iliac bone to the head of the femur. A combined technique of hemodilution and intraoperative blood salvaging was applied to supplement the blood loss during the operation. Intraoperative monitoring included continuous arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiograph, SVO2, bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (APTT), and thromboelastography. A total of 900 ml of blood was drawn and the same volume of 5% albumin solution was infused over half an hour before the beginning of the surgery. During the operation, 2100 ml of blood was lost, and 1260 ml of autologous blood, 400 ml of homogeneous red blood cells and 5 units of fresh platelet were infused. The values of PT, APTT, bleeding time were within normal ranges after the surgery. Only 3 units of fresh platelet was infused in 2 weeks after the surgery. It was suggested that hemodilution and salvaging autotransfusion is safely performed and beneficial to minimize homogeneous blood transfusion even in a case of aplastic anemia.
