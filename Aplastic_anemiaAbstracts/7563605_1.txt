Between July, 1990 and March, 1994, 31 patients with hematological malignancies or severe aplastic anemia underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Second Department of Internal medicine, Chiba University Hospital. Among the 29 evaluable patients who survived over 100 days after transplant, 11 patients (37.9%) developed late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis with a median time of onset of 57 days (range 11-205) from BMT. Adenovirus type 11 was isolated from the urine of 4 patients. Five patients recovered with fluid hydration and forced diuresis, while 6 patients had persistent gross hematuria with clot formation, 5 of whom also developed hydronephrosis. Seven-day courses of 500 micrograms prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) bladder instillations was initiated to control hematuria in these 6 patients. Complete resolution of gross hematuria was achieved in 4, and partial response with decreased clot formation and partial clearing of the urine was observed after 4 of 9 courses of the treatment. Although all patients experienced bladder spasm or lower abdominal pain during the PGE1 instillations, these symptoms were manageable with sedative drugs and morphine. No systemic side effect was apparent. PGE1 bladder instillations is a safe and useful treatment for severe, life-threatening late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic BMT.
