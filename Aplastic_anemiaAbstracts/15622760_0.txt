OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between colony-stimulating activities of serum from patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and their responses to immunosuppressive therapy (IST). METHODS: In vitro effects of sera from SAA patients before and after IST and from normal subjects on human marrow colony growth were examined in a semisolid methylcellulose culture system for burst promoting activity (BPA) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA). Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level was also measured by ELISA method before and after IST in SAA patients. RESULTS: Serum BPAs in SAA patients at diagnosis were significantly higher than that in normal controls (P<0.001), but serum GM-CSAs in 13 of 22 SAA patients were normal,and in 9 of 22 extremely low as compared with normal values. After IST, serum BPA and GM-CSA in SAA patients had no changes. Serum Epo levels in SAA patients at diagnosis were significantly higher than that in normal controls (P<0.001). After IST,serum Epo levels declined in responded patients, while further increased in nonresponded. CONCLUSION: Serum GM-CSA of SAA patients was a predictive factor for responsiveness to IST, and a normal value was associated with a good response.
