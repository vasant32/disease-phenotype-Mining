To study the incidence of telomerase gene mutations in Chinese patients with acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) and explore its relationship with telomere shortening. Blood samples from 66 patients with aplastic anemia (AA) in northern China were collected and TERC mutation analysis was performed. Two TERC mutations were identified. The incidence of telomerase gene mutations in Chinese people with acquired AA is similar to that of the western people.
