 OBJECTIVE: To detect the differential expression of cell signal transduction genes associated with benzene poisoning, and to explore the pathogenic mechanisms of blood system damage induced by benzene. METHODS: Peripheral white blood cell gene expression profile of 7 benzene poisoning patients, including one aplastic anemia, was determined by cDNA microarray. Seven chips from normal workers were served as controls. Cluster analysis of gene expression profile was performed. RESULTS: Among the 4265 target genes, 176 genes associated with cell signal transduction were differentially expressed. 35 up-regulated genes including PTPRC, STAT4, IFITM1 etc were found in at least 6 pieces of microarray; 45 down-regulated genes including ARHB, PPP3CB, CDC37 etc were found in at least 5 pieces of microarray. CONCLUSION: cDNA microarray technology is an effective technique for screening the differentially expressed genes of cell signal transduction. Disorder in cell signal transduction may play certain role in the pathogenic mechanism of benzene poisoning.
