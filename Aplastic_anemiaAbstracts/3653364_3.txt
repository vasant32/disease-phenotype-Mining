Bone marrow failure encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders including aplastic, dysmyelopoietic and myelophtisic anemias. In the present study, these anemias were characterized according to the degree of erythroid proliferation and efficiency of erythropoiesis. Total erythropoietic activity was evaluated in 43 patients by measuring the erythron transferrin uptake (ETU). It averaged 20% of basal (range 3-43%) in 13 patients with severe aplastic anemia, 75% of basal (range 60-103%) in 3 patients with extensive bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic cells, 131% of basal (range 50-217%) in 16 patients with refractory anemia, and 452% of basal (range 63-720) in 11 patients with idiopathic refractory siderobastic anemia. Respective efficiencies of erythropoiesis were 74% in aplastic anemia, 70% with bone marrow infiltration, 46% in refractory anemia, and 14% in sideroblastic anemia. Based on the ETU, patients could be categorized into absolute marrow failure, relative marrow failure, and adequate erythropoietic response to anemia. This simple determination of proliferating activity of the erythroid marrow can provide useful information on the pathophysiology of marrow failure and a basis for the selection of therapeutic approaches.
