Here we report patients with Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma, who relapsed/progressed after high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. In patients who developed aplastic anemia type syndrome, spontaneous tumor regression was observed and concomitantly high titers of serum autoantibodies were found. In order to identify the antibody specificity, two-dimensional electrophoresis, blotting and immunoreactions were used to analyze the peripheral blood stem cell extract with autoantibodies containing serum. The unique protein spot visualized exclusively by serum of patients with aplastic anemia type syndrome was identified as carbonic anhydrase I (CA I, accession No. P00915 and Q7M316) by means of mass spectrometry. The specificity of autoantibodies was confirmed by reaction with commercial CAs I, II, IX and XII. Immunoreaction in Western blots with these CA isoforms differed in sera obtained from patients with various types of the disease. Sera of Hodgkin's disease patients reacted with CA I, II and XII; sera of multiple myeloma patients reacted with the CA I, II, XII and IX. Patients developing and/or possessing CA autoantibodies had a significant survival benefit over those who did not develop CA anhydrase autoantibodies. Possible relevance of the presence of CA autoantibodies and clinical outcome is discussed.
