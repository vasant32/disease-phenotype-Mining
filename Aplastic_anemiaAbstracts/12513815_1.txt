In order to explore the application of bone marrow imprint in diagnosis of anemia, sixty-five diagnosed anemia cases were analyzed with bone marrow imprint, bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow smear. The result showed that the diagnostic rates of bone marrow imprint and biopsy were both significantly higher than bone marrow smear, especially in the cases with myelofibrosis, aplastic anemia and metastatic carcinoma in bone marrow (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between bone marrow imprint and biopsy, however the bone marrow imprint observed more clearly and more simple and convenient than the bone marrow biopsy. It is concluded that bone marrow imprint is important for diagnosing anemia.
