Efficacy of splenectomy at initial stage of multimodality treatment of severe aplastic anemia was assessed in 25 patients aged 15-42. None of the patients achieved remission though there was a relief of hemorrhagic syndrome, diminished requirement in transfusion of donor platelets, a persistent rise in the counts of reticulocytes, leukocytes, absolute number of granulocytes in peripheral blood on postoperative days 14-21 and 60. All the patients were subsequently treated with immunodepressants.
