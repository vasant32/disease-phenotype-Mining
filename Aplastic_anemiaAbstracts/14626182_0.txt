 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Composite Zaizhang decoction (ZZD) on immune function of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) patients. METHODS: To determine the levels of T-lymphocyte subset, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in CAA patients before and after treatment, and to analyse the regulation of their changes comparatively with the group treated with conventional treatment and a normal control group. RESULTS: Before treatment, CD4 was lower, CD8 higher, CD4/CD8 ratio also lower, TNF-alpha and IL-2 were higher in the ZZD treated group than those in the normal control group, with significant difference (P < 0.05), but after ZZD treatment, these indexes were all inversely changed, as compared with those before treatment and with those in the control group, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ZZD might relieve the hemopoietic inhibition so as to promote the recovery of hemopoietic function through improving the T-lymphocyte subset and reducing the release of hemopoietic negative ragulatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-2 etc.
