 BACKGROUND: Since 1978, 856 hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations have been performed for adult patients in Turkey. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were collected on the source of hematopoietic progenitor cells, recipient diagnosis, conditioning regimen, DFS and mortality. The data were analyzed by the national registry system of the Blood and Marrow Transplantation Subcommittee of the Turkish Society of Hematology. This analysis allowed the examination of national trends in survival, outcome and transplant-related complications in certain diseases. DISCUSSION: In the allogeneic setting, the results of transplants for acute and chronic leukemia, with the exception of severe aplastic anemia, were similar to those found in the European and international registries. Likewise, in the autologous setting, the transplant results from Turkey paralleled those in European and international registries.
