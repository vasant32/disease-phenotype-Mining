 PURPOSE: B-mode ultrasound (US) of hepatic candidiasis (HC) shows an uncharacteristic pattern. The aim of this study is to display the pattern of HC by performing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2006 and June 2008 HC was diagnosed in 12 patients (4 female, 8 male) by clinical and sonographic findings. The underlying diseases were acute leukemia (n = 10), aplastic anemia (n = 1), and testicular cancer (n = 1) in either the state of complete remission (n = 10) or relapse (n = 2). Due to neutropenic fever after chemotherapy all of the patients had received antifungal therapy. When HC was diagnosed all patients were afebrile and in a recovered hematological constitution. Additional diagnostic procedures were histological examination (n = 5), computed tomography (n = 8) and sonographic follow-up examinations (n = 12). All patients were examined with B-mode US and CEUS. RESULTS: In B-mode US the lesions were hypoechoic (n = 12), multiple (n = 10) and > 1 cm (n = 8) as well as > 2 cm (n = 4) in diameter. During CEUS no enhancement of contrast media in the centre of the lesions was seen in all cases during both phases. Additionally, in the arterial phase, the lesions showed no rim enhancement (n = 3) (type I), an isoechoic rim enhancement (n = 5) (type II), or a hyperechoic rim enhancement (n = 4) (type III). During sonographic follow-up a complete regression of the lesions (n = 9) or a stable disease (n = 2) was seen. One patient died due to a relapse. CONCLUSION: The CEUS pattern of HC is variable but characteristic. Therefore, CEUS should be performed in all patients with suspected HC.
