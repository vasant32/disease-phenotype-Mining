A 15 year old girl with aplastic anemia developed a heparin-like anticoagulant during the course of systemic candidiasis. This was initially detected in the laboratory by an elevation of the thrombin clotting time which corrected with toluidine blue but not by mixing with normal plasma. In vivo and in vitro the anticoagulant was remarkably resistant to neutralization by protamine sulfate. Nevertheless, its heparin-like nature was confirmed by its sensitivity to heparinase and its dependence on antithrombin III.
