Over a 30 month-period (1.7.85-7.1.88) 44 totally implantable catheter-systems were used in 41 patients under oncological treatment. Indication was in 40 cases pending, or already started chemotherapy; in one case the indication were multiple transfusions because of aplastic anemia. We used three similar systems of different manufacturers. Our experiences with implantation and care of these systems as well as minor complications are demonstrated.
