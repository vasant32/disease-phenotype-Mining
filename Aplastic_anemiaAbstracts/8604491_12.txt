BACKGROUND: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, although immunosuppressed, are at risk for the development of red cell (RBC) and HLA antibodies, and they often are given filtered blood in an effort to prevent the latter complication. This study attempts to determine the rate of formation and the specificity of both RBC and HLA alloantibodies in this patient population. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: BMT patients (148 received autologous marrow; 45 received allogeneic marrow) from an 18-month period, including patients with leukemia (57 patients), lymphoma (54), breast cancer (68), myeloma (8), myelodysplastic syndrome (5), and aplastic anemia (1), were studied to determine the rate of alloantibody formation to RBC and HLA antigens. A total of 2,410 RBC antibody screens were performed. The patients received 3,921 packed RBCs and 5,915 single-donor platelet units; all were irradiated and administered via white cell-reduction filters. RESULTS: Seven (3.6%) of 193 patients had RBC antibodies upon hospital admission. Four (2.1%) of 193 developed RBC antibodies during the course of BMT: 3 patients had one RBC antibody and 1 patient had two RBC antibodies. RBC antibodies included anti-E (n = 2), anti-M (n = 1), anti-Jkb (n = 1), and anti-Lu14 (n = 1). Thus, 98 percent of patients (189/193) did not develop new (182/186) or additional (7/7) RBC antibodies during BMT. BMT patients were also screened weekly for HLA antibody formation (60-cell panel). Upon admission, 170 (85%) patients were negative. Of these, 8 (4.7%) developed persistent HLA antibodies (mean panel-reactive antibody score, 33 +/- 29%) and 9 (5.3%) were variably positive. Thus, in our setting and population, RBC antibody formation was 0.1 percent per unit transfused, and the HLA alloimmunization rate was 5 to 10 percent. CONCLUSION: As RBC antibody screens are done every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on this BMT service and as RBC antibody formation is low in these patients, screening for unexpected antibodies might be possible on a more infrequent basis. Also, the rate of HLA alloimmunization in this population receiving filtered blood components is low.
