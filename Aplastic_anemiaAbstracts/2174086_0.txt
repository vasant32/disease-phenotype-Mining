A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of further examination of anemia in November, 1978. She was diagnosed as having aplastic anemia, which was not associated with any atypical findings. Treatment with oxymetholone had been effective. However, she developed pancytopenia in January, 1988. A bone marrow aspiration revealed a hypocellular marrow with 75.6% blasts. Following two courses with low dose cytosine arabinoside and vitamin D3, the leukemia improved although she needs red cell transfusions at intervals of one to two months because of persistent pancytopenia. We present a patient with aplastic anemia who developed a hypoplastic leukemia at the tenth year of the disease.
