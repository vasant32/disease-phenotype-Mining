 OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognostic factors for very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients treated mainly with Chinese Kidney (Shen)-invigorating drugs (CKID) combined with anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). METHODS: Twenty-seven VSAA patients were treated with CSID+ALG/ATG therapy in conjunction with cyclosporine A, androgen, hemopoietic growth factor, etc. The relationship of the effectiveness and some factors (age of patients, course of illness, blood and bone marrow figures, etc.) were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 25 evaluated VSAA patients who had been followed up for over 1 year, 9 patients (36.0%) were basically cured, 5 (20.0%) remitted, 6 (24.0%) were markedly improved, and 5 (20.0%) were treated in vain, with the total effective rate of treatment being 80.0% (20/25). Better clinical therapeutic effects were shown in patients newly diagnosed with VSAA, of male sex (P=0.037), >20 years old (P=0.045), with an illness course [Symbol: see text] month (P=0.048), with peripheral neutrophil count >0.1 × 10(9)/L (P=0.023), and with reticulocyte count >10 × 10(9)/L (P=0.002). Platelet count (P=0.620) and bone marrow lymphocyte percentage (P=0.736) showed no correlation with the therapeutic effectiveness. Multi-factor analysis by the Kaplan-Meier procedure on the factors influencing survival showed that rather longer survival times occurred in patients > 20 years old, with peripheral neutrophil count [Symbol: see text] 0.1 × 10(9)/L, reticulocyte count [Symbol: see text]10 × 10(9)/L, and platelet count > 10 × 10(9)/L (all P=0.0001). Bone marrow lymphocyte percentage and the initiation time of ALG/ATG application (from onset of the illness) showed no significant influence on patients' survival time (P=0.085 and P=0.935, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CSKD+ALG/ATG therapy for treatment of VSAA could enhance the current clinical therapeutic effects and elevate patients' survival rate. Conditions including male sex, age >20 years, illness course [Symbol: see text]1 month, neutrophil count >0.1 × 10(9)/L, and reticulocyte count >10 × 10(9)/L are the likely effective indices for predicting favorable therapeutic effectiveness in newly diagnosed VSAA patients.
