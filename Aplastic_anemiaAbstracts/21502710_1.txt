From 1996 to the end of 2009, a total of 114 cases of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were performed in the Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University. We report here a general overview of our results. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was performed in 37 cases of acute leukemia, 10 of myelodysplastic syndrome, 5 of aplastic anemia, and 5 others. The 5-year survival rate with allo-HSCT was 51.1%. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) was performed in 34 cases of malignant lymphoma, 15 of multiple myeloma, and 8 others. The 5-year patient survival rate was 75.2% with malignant lymphoma and 46.7% with multiple myeloma. These results are comparable to those from a nationwide survey in Japan, confirming that our hospital has attained a creditable level as a transplantation center.
