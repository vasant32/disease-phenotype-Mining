A successfull bone marrow transplant was achieved in a case of post hepatitic aplastic anemia after cyclophosphamide immunosuppression. Caryotype analysis, erythrocytic phenotype and IgG Gm allotype demonstrated evidence of complete chimerism. Anti-thymocyte serum undoubtly was able to suppress a life threatening episode of graft versus host reaction. Severe long lasting skin lesions are now persisting 2 years after the graft.
