The incidence of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in the lymphocytes of patients with aplastic anemia (AA) was determined before and after exposure to mitomycin C (MMC). The "baseline" SCE rate was significantly higher in AA, but MMC-induced SCE rate was not different compared to controls. It is suggested that some patients with AA may have an underlying DNA damage.
