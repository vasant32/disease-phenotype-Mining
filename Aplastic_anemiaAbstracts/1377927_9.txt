Levels of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with various leukocyte disorders were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Some cases of acute myelogenous leukemia and aplastic anemia showed elevated serum levels of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF, whereas almost all of 23 healthy controls showed G-CSF and GM-CSF levels lower than 100 pg/ml. High levels of both types of CSF were noted in patients with granulocytosis due to infection. These levels became lower after resolution of the infection. Daily changes in serum CSF levels were also examined in a patient with autoimmune neutropenia, and it was found that the peripheral neutrophilic granulocyte count changed almost in parallel with the serum G-CSF level but not with GM-CSF, following the pattern with a delay of about 4-5 h, suggesting the possibility that G-CSF mainly regulates peripheral neutrophil circulation.
