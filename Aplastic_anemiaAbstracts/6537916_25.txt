We reviewed the causes of death of 55 granulocytopenic patients who received empiric antibiotic treatment for fever according to an EORTC cooperative protocol; 53 presented cancer and 2 aplastic anemia. Among the 55 patients, 19 (35%) deaths were attributed to infection: 16 to bacterial and 3 to fungal infections. Among the patients with bacterial infections, 12 died from septic shock, 3 from pneumonia and 1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis. The most frequent non-infectious causes of death were the cancer progression (18%) and hemorrhagic complications (27%), most often cerebromeningeal in relationship to thrombocytopenia. A large number of the patients who died from infection (78%) and hemorrhage (74%) had advanced cancer with poor chances to respond to anticancer therapy.
