Autoimmunity is a recognized factor in pure red cell aplasia and in some cases of aplastic anemia, but not in agranulocytosis. The case reported here demonstrated that pure neutrophilic aplasia of autoimmune origin may exist in man. A 75-year-old male is described who presented with complete agranulocytosis and absence of neutrophilic precursors in the bone marrow without thrombocytopenia or anemia. After 6 weeks, remission was induced by immunosuppressive treatment and 22 months later the patient is doing well without therapy. The absence of known cases of agranulocytosis, a good response to immunosuppressive therapy, and the demonstrated fact that the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells inhibit the growth of granulocytic colonies of normal human marrow in vitro allow the conclusion that this patient had pure neutropenic aplasia, probably due to autoimmune phenomena.
