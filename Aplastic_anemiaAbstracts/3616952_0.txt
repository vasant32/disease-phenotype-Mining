The paper is concerned with the results of embolization of the splenic artery in 30 patients with hypoplastic anemia. Two methods of occlusion of the splenic artery have been considered: one-stage total and two-stage embolization of the splenic artery. The results obtained indicated the efficacy of this therapeutic method; immediate and long-term results of embolization of the splenic artery did not differ from those following operation. The authors have arrived at a conclusion that the new method of treatment of hypoplastic anemia by means of endovascular embolization of the splenic artery can be an alternative to splenectomy.
