Purpura fulminans is a rare disease characterized by purpura ecchymosis, hypotension, and fever associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. It often begins as a benign infectious process and subsequently progresses to a severe, catastrophic outcome. It is recognized to originate from congenital or acquired protein C deficiency. We present an unusual case of an adult with Xanthomonas maltophilia sepsis that subsequently developed into purpura fulminans with involvement of the four extremities. We discuss the importance of the protein C system in coagulation homeostasis and its relationship to purpura fulminans.
