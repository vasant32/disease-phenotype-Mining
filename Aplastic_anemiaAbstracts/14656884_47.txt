From January 1978 to December 2001, 133 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent non-T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor, at the Hospital Saint Louis using either the combination of cyclophosphamide (Cy) and thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI; n=100) or Cy and antithymocyte globulin (ATG; n=33), as a conditioning regimen. With 13.6 years of follow-up, the 10-year survival estimate was 64%. Four factors were associated with lower survival: older age, use of Cy-TAI, any form of treatment prior to transplantation (either androgens or immunosuppressive therapy, [IST]), and grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). TAI was the sole factor associated with the occurrence of acute GvHD. The risk of cancers (15-year cumulative incidence, 10.9%) was associated with older age and with the use of cyclosporine as IST before transplantation. Cumulative incidences and risk factors of nonmalignant late effect including avascular osteonecrosis and late bacterial, viral, and fungal infection were also analyzed. Improved results using Cy-ATG as conditioning can lead to more than 90% chance of cure in patients with SAA. Even if, in our experience, the role of Cy-ATG versus that of Cy-TAI remained inextricably related to the year of transplantation, the major detrimental role of the GvHD disease in the long-term outcome and its relation to TAI supports avoidance of irradiation in the conditioning regimen. Furthermore, avoidance of any IST before transplantation in patients with a sibling donor is a prerequisite for attaining such excellent results.
