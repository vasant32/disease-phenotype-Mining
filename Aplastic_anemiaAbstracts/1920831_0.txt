The case survey of drug-induced hematologic disorders in Shikoku District (Ehime Prefecture) disclosed 21 patients. Cases were 12 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 2 brain tumor, one epilepsy, 2 liver cirrhosis, one neuralgia, one arthralgia, one hyperthyroidism, and one IBL-like T-lymphoma. Causative drugs for aplastic anemia were Metalcaptase, Shiosol, Voltaren and Emeside. Drug-induced aplastic anemia was so severe that 4 out of 5 patients had died of bone marrow dysfunction. Neutropenia was caused by drugs as Rimatil, Cefobit, Sepatren, Mercazole, Sulpyrin, Aleviatin, Cefamedin and Metalcaptase. The real causes of these drug-induced hematologic disorders have not been clear. Remarkably high incidence among rheumatoid arthritis patients is suggestive several reasons as unique reactivity associated with HLA, suppression on hematologic stem cells by abnormal metabolites, and immunologic dysfunction commonly seen in collagen diseases. Further studies of more accurate incidence of drug-induced hematologic disorders are needed in investigating real causes of unhappy side-effects.
