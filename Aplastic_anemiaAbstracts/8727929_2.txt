A chemiluminescence in situ hybridization method was developed for the search of B19 parvovirus DNA in bone marrow cells, employing digoxigenin-labeled B19 DNA probes, immunoenzymatically detected with a highly sensitive 1,2-dioxetane phosphate as chemiluminescent substrate. The light emitted from the in situ-hybridized probe was analyzed and measured by a high-performance luminograph connected to an optical microscope and to a personal computer for the quantification of the photon fluxes from the single cells and for image analysis. The chemiluminescence in situ hybridization was applied to bone marrow cell smears of patients with aplastic crisis or hypoplastic anemia, who had been previously tested by in situ hybridization with colorimetric detection, dot blot hybridization, and nested PCR. The chemiluminescent assay provided an objective estimation of the data, proved specific, and showed an increased sensitivity in detecting B19 DNA compared with in situ hybridization with colorimetric detection.
