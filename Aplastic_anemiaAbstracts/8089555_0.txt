Candida is present in the flora of the oral cavity, skin, intestinal tract and vagina, and is also known to be an opportunistic pathogen. Infection with this fungus has been increasing annually along with wide spread use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The subjects included 95 patients (48 males and 47 females) who had been diagnosed as having had deep-seated candidiasis, among patients autopsied between 1982 to 1991. In regard to annual changes in deep-seated candidiasis, the incidence reached a peak in the 1985 to 1988 period, and thereafter decreased. The number of cases with leukemia as the underlying disease was the largest, 36 (37.9%), followed by malignant lymphoma in 10, and aplastic anemia 5. The number of cases with infection of the stomach was largest, 42 (44.2%), followed by the esophagus in 33 (34.7%), the lung and kidney. The cases with deep-seated candidiasis showed low values of or level of lymphocyte, hemoglobin, CRP, total protein and cholesterol and high values or levels of LDH, urea N, creatinine and total bilirubin. Cases with marked decrease in neutrophils showed no regional infiltration of inflammatory cells in any of the organs infected with Candida. Cases with disseminated candidiasis showed vascular invasion by Candida. The laboratory findings also showed that most of the cases had been undernourished and had high values of CRP which supports the presence of inflammation. Common sites of infection are the esophagus, stomach, and intestinal tract. In the presence of granulocytopenia and immunodeficiency, tissue invasion become severe and associated with vascular invasion.
