We report the course of an aspergillus brain abscess in an 18-year-old female patient who underwent bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia. The abscess was discovered on day 35 post-transplant, in a cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan performed for the evaluation of an unexplained headache. Meanwhile, she was receiving broad-spectrum antibacterials and liposomal amphotericin B for a right upper pulmonary lobe infiltrate. A percutaneous puncture of the cerebral lesion was performed; fungal elements were seen in the pus obtained and its culture yielded A. fumigatus. The dose of amphotericin B was increased, intraconazole was added and two more punctures were done. With these antifungals, the abscess regressed significantly; so, amphotericin B was discontinued after a cumulative dose of 6775 mg but intraconazole was maintained at 400 mg/day. At the last follow-up, seventeen months after detection of the abscess, the patient was well, without symptoms and the cerebral lesion diminished to a very small, thick-walled CT image.
