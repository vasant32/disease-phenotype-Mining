Aplastic anemia has been a rare complication of thymic tumors documented in only a few cases. We now report that a previously healthy, 72-year-old woman had a well-differentiated squamous cell thymic carcinoma and severe aplastic anemia, as detected on a simultaneous basis. After extirpation of the thymic carcinoma, hematological recovery was achieved. While cyclosporine (CyA), prednisolone (PSL), and methenolone improved hematological data even more, a partial and stable remission has been sustained for 22 months. The patient's serum prior to the surgery had a suppressive effect on the formation of colonies of erythroid and nonerythroid colonies, as determined using the patient's bone marrow cells and compared with the patient's serum after the surgery and normal AB serum. This case report concerns a patient in whom we observed simultaneous occurrence of a thymic tumor and a sever marrow aplasia for which we describe our therapeutic approach.
