The presence of cutaneous immunoglobulin and complement was investigated in 88 patients with and without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation of bone marrow from HLA identical siblings for the treatment of acute leukemia or aplastic anemia. For comparison, skin biopsies from the patients obtained before transplantation, from 58 healthy individuals (mostly marrow donors) and from four syngeneic marrow recipients were studied. A direct immunfluorescent staining technique was used. Dermo-epidermal IgM deposits were found in 11% of healthy individuals and patients before grafting but were present in 86% of patients with chronic and 39% of patients with acute GVHD. Patients with allogeneic grafts who never had GVHD or who had recovered from it and patients with syngeneic grafts showed findings not different from those in healthy individuals. Findings similar to those with IgM, although less striking, were made for C3, i.e., patients who had chronic or acute GVHD had a high incidence and intensity of C3 deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction. This observation raises the possibility that humoral immunity is involved in the development of GVHD.
