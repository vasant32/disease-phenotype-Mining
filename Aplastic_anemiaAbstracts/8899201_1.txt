We describe an unusual case of a renal abscess by Salmonella enteritidis in a 32-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He was receiving immunosuppressive therapy with CsA and corticosteroids for chronic GVHD. He was not neutropenic and had no history of enterocolitis or cholelithiasis before the onset. Four months after the transplantation, he developed an abscess in the upper pole of his right kidney from which Salmonella enteritidis was isolated in culture. He was successfully treated with a combination of percutaneous drainage and washing the cyst through the catheter using piperacillin sodium-containing solution. The possibility of salmonellosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such patients.
