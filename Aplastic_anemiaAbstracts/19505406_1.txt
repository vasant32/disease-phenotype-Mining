Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be responsible for both hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations including dermatitis, polyarthralgias and arthritis, pulmonary disease, aplastic anemia, glomerulonephritis and vasculitis. The mechanism of these extrahepatic disorders is thought to be linked to immune complex disease, but their pathogenesis is poorly clarified. Immunosuppressive treatment could promote viral load and impair hepatic disease, also worsening the vasculitis by enhancing viral antigenemia. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue approved for treating chronic hepatitis B, that decreases the amount of viral antigens by suppressing HBV replication. Several reports have suggested lamivudine in the treatment of vasculitis associated with HBV infection, but, although significant inhibition of HBV is achieved in the short term, resistance develops in 15-32 percent annual risk rating. We report an elderly patient whose chronic hepatitis B decompensated cirrhosis with associated refractory hepatic hydrothorax and extensive leukocytoclastic vasculitis was successfully treated with ongoing long-term lamivudine monotherapy.
