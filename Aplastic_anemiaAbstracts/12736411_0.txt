Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia. We report 6 children diagnosed as Diamond-Blackfan anemia at our clinic. All had severe pallor at presentation, with mild hepatomegaly and just palpable spleen in one child. Thumb anomaly was present in one of them. All of them had macrocytic or normocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia, and bone marrow examination revealed marked erythroid hypoplasia. All of them were treated with oral steroids with a good response.
