Sixteen (24%) of 68 patients with aplastic anemia had antibodies cytotoxic to their own lymphocytes before specific disease treatment. These antibodies displayed the characteristics of cold reactive lymphocytotoxins (LTs). No correlation existed between the detection of auto-LTs and a viral or toxic cause of the disease or the patients' HLA genotype. A lower frequency of anti-HLA antibodies was recorded in the pretreatment sera of patients with auto-LTs. However, the response rate to antilymphocyte serum treatment and the outcome of the bone marrow grafts were comparable among the patient's groups with or without pretreatment auto-LTs.
