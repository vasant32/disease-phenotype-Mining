A 16-yr-old girl received liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis. Aplastic anemia developed, and she received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Eleven months after liver transplantation, abdominal lymph node enlargement and colon ulcers were observed, and colon biopsy showed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Immunosuppression reduction was attempted, but it produced no therapeutic effect. Fourteen months after liver transplantation, she received a second HSCT due to engraftment failure, and PTLD resolved completely. The second HSCT can serve as cellular therapy for PTLD.
