With the aim to detect genotypically identical donors for patients suffering from some type of leukemia or aplastic anemia, HLA antigens and MLC reactivity were determined in 72 families, having together 209 children. HLA identical, MLC negative sibling donors were found for 31 patients, i.e. 43%. Compared to the healthy population, no significant differences were found in the frequency of HLA antigens and haplotypes in 58 leukemic patients. Two recombinations were recorded, one between the loci HLA-A and HLA-B, and the other one between HLA-B and HLA-D/DR. Only 9 persons (2.5%) homozygous for HLA-D antigens were found in the whole series of 353 subjects investigated.
