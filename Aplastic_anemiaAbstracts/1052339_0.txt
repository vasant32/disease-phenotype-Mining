The cell composition of peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen of CBA mice after the transplantation ca. 20.10(6) lymph node cells of a Wistar rat, sensitized against mouse liver antigens 10--15 days prior to the transplantation, during first 24 hrs after birth was studied. The runt disease developed in 100% recipients and was characterized by sharp disturbances of the formation of immuno- and hemopoietic systems. All runting animals suffered from aplastic anemia, leukopenia with predominance of hyperlobular neutrophils and histio-monocytes in the peripheral blood. The total number of cells in bone marrow decreased almost 15 times. The elimination of erythroid line was coupled with relative augmentation of undifferentiated myeloid and monocytoid cells. The cellular pool of spleen increased twice and more. The intensive proliferation of histio-monocytes and macrophages was accompanied by the destruction and depletion of lymphatic structures. A suggestion is put forward to the effect that the incorporation of "not-self" genetic information, such as non-syngeneic lymphocytes, during the early postnatal period may not only induced some genuine immunological effects, but inhibit the normal way of differentiation in proliferating cell systems due to the lack of their mutual adaptation as well.
