One of two sisters with hypoplastic anemia and increased chromosomal fragility, but no clinical stigmata of Fanconi's anemia (FA), progressed to preleukemia (with a clone of chromosomally abnormal cells in the bone marrow), and then to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The findings indicate that constitutional genetic instability can lead to karyotypically aberrant neoplastic clones in the Estren-Dameshek variant of FA as well as in the more typical chromosomal fragility syndromes.
