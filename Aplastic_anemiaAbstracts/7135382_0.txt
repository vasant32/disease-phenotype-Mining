In the period 1975-1981 seventeen patients aged from 4 to 30 months were seen with transient normochromic, normocytic anemia and reticulocytopenia caused by erythroblastopenia. The majority of the cases (12/17) were seen in autumn and winter. In 16 of the patients bone marrow aspirates were obtained; they showed erythroblastopenia. In 7 cases we observed young lymphoïd cells, which suggested the diagnosis of leukemia. Distinguishing features of congenital hypoplastic anemia and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood are compared. Except for blood transfusion, therapy e.g. corticosteroïds is not necessary in transient erythroblastopenia of childhood. Spontaneous recovery is a diagnostic feature, contrasting with congenital hypoplastic anemia.
