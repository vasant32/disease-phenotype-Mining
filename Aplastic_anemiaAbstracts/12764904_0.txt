 OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of TCM for reinforcing Shen and activating blood circulation to dredge Channels in auxiliary treating chronic aplastic anemia (CAA), and to explore its mechanism. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with CAA were randomly divided into the treated group treated with TCM plus western medicine and the control group treated with western medicine alone. The clinical efficacy was observed and levels of plasma sFas and sFasL before and after treatment were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The basic cure rate and total effective rate in the treated group were 37.50% and 87.50%; while in the control group were 20. 51% and 61.54% respectively. Comparison between the two groups showed significant difference (P < 0.01). The sFas level was markedly lower in both groups before treatment, but after treatment, it got elevated in the treated group significantly (P < 0.05), as compared with that in the control group, the difference was significant (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: TCM is effective in treating CAA with less toxic and side-effect, the mechanism might be the inhibition on over apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in CAA patients through regulating immune function of organism.
