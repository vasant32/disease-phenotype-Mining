A 71-year-old female patient was admitted with generalized lymphadenopathy, anemia and thrombocytopenia. On admission a peripheral blood examination showed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 1.95 x 10(6)/microliter, hemoglobin (Hb) 5.0 g/dl, platelet count (Plt) 2.2 x 10(4)/microliter and no reticulocytes. A bone marrow aspiration specimen was hypocellular with a nuclear cell count 1.0 x 10(4)/microliter, erythroblasts less than 0.3% and no megakaryocytes. Serum examination showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and the results of the direct/indirect Coombs test indicated the existence of auto-antibodies. as immunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like T cell lymphoma was diagnosed based on the lymph node biopsy specimen. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and etoposide obtained improvement of lymphadenopathy, hypergamma globulinemia, hypoplastic bone marrow and thrombocytopenia. On the other hand, the anemia did not improve and the ratio of erythroblasts in total bone marrow cells was remainde 0.5%. The detailed mechanism of this hypoplastic anemia is still unknown, however, our results imply some
