Pancytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed in a 62-year-old woman. Scattered granulomatous nodules in the bone marrow, composed of numerous eosinophilic concentric spherules with amorphous eosinophilic deposits and reticulin fibrosis between them, resulted in the destruction of the bone marrow architecture. These rare morphologic appearances in the bone marrow may have been caused by lipogranulomatosis and multiple bone marrow infarctions, which were subsequent developments to DIC. Such a process is believed to have induced a lethal secondary hypoplastic anemia.
