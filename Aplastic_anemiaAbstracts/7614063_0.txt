We used polymerase chain reaction amplification of minisatellites sequences (33.6.3, G3, PMS51, YNZ22) and of a Y chromosome specific sequence (DYZ1) to document chimaerism in 50 patients. Indications for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was acute leukemia (n = 23). Aplastic anemia (n = 18) and inherited newborn disease, SCID and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 9). The method was informative in all cases. We were able to demonstrate engraftment in 23/23 leukemia patients, 15/18 in aplastic patients and 8/9 in the last group of patients. HLA mismatching BMT was significantly less efficient. Analysis with DYZ1 probe in case of sex mismatched. BMT revealed the frequency of host residual cells after Bott. Their detection in a 0.01-1% range does not seem to influence the outcome of the transplantation procedure.
