Three young patients with severe aplastic anemia undergoing intensive immunosuppressive therapy developed fever and pulmonary infiltrates during longlasting severe granulocytopenia, despite multiple broad spectrum antibiotic combinations and granulocyte transfusions. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed only by thoracotomy. In conjunction with high dose amphotericin-B therapy complete resolution of aspergillosis was achieved in two cases, paralleled by slow recovery of bone marrow function, whereas in the third case only a partial remission was possible together with transient amelioration of granulopoiesis. We suggest early aggressive surgical methods to establish the diagnosis of aspergillosis in these severely menaced patients, so that antifungal therapy with high dose amphotericin-B can be initiated at an early stage.
