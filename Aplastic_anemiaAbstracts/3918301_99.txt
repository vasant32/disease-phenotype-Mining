We have investigated interferon as a mediator of hematopoietic suppression in bone marrow failure. Interferon production by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with aplastic anemia was significantly higher than that observed in controls; spontaneous interferon production by these cells was also high for more than half of aplastic anemia patients. Circulating interferon, not detectable in normal individuals, was detected in 10 of 24 patients. Interferon is a potent inhibitor of hematopoietic cell proliferation and, therefore, may be the mediator of suppression in many in vitro models employing patients' cells and sera. The possible pathogenic importance of interferon in aplastic anemia was suggested by an increase in hematopoietic colony formation in vitro after exposure of bone marrow cells to antiinterferon antisera (277 +/- 71% increase for patients compared to 1.6 +/- 1.6% for normal individuals). Interferon levels in the bone marrow sera of aplastic anemia patients were high (mean = 203 international units (IU)/ml, n = 8), even in comparison to circulating levels in the same patients. Normal bone marrow sera also contained measurable interferon but at lower levels (41 IU/ml, n = 16), indicating that interferon may be a normal bone marrow product. High concentration of bone marrow interferon, possibly due to abnormal immunologic activity or a reaction to virus infection of the bone marrow, may mediate hematopoietic suppression in aplastic anemia patients.
