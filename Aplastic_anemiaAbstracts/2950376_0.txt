Anti HbS antibody levels were retrospectively studied in 31 children who received at least 4 immunisations with HEVAC vaccine. Results were as follow: 305 mUI/l (6 immunocompetent patients), 263 mUI/l (4 patients with solid tumors of therapy), 26 mUI/l (16 acute leukemias receiving intermittent reinduction therapy), 0.7 mUI/l (3 acute leukemias on maintenance therapy), 0 mUI/l (2 patients allografted for severe aplastic anemia, on immunosuppressive therapy). Antibody levels of patients who received immunisation during reinduction therapy were not correlated with intervall between immunisation and previous or next reinduction, not correlated with intervall from start of therapy, but seemed inversely correlated to age at time of diagnosis and at time of immunisation.
