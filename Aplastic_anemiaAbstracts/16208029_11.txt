We report a case of breakthrough invasive zygomycosis in a stem cell transplant recipient who was receiving caspofungin for treatment of a breakthrough Candida krusei fungemia that occurred during fluconazole prophylaxis. Also, patients receiving the echinocandin caspofungin remain at risk for pathogens, such as zygomycetes, that are intrinsically resistant to this agent.
