Much progress has been made in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and acute leukemia (AL). In SAA it was shown that hemopoietic chimerism and apparently permanent cures can be achieved in the majority of patients by conditioning with cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling. The previous transfusion history is crucial for failure or success: untransfused patients do very well while graft rejection is an enormous problem in most polytransfused ones. We have shown that most patients without HLA-identical sibling donors can be adequately helped as well. After conditioning with ALG followed by transfusion of haploidentical marrow and low dose androgens there is partial to complete autologous hemopoietic reconstitution in virtually all patients. This points to the fact that most of these patients have pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells that are intact, but apparently unable to differentiate to mature cells, because they are inhibited by autoimmune mechanisms. The results of BMT in patients with endstage leukemia are modest. New pilotstudies with early marrow grafts, i.e. for ANLL in first remission and for ALL in second remission indicate that with this type of approach potentially over 50% of all patients with HLA-identical siblings can be cured. We recommend that HLA-typing should be performed early in families with SAA and AL and that the possibility of a marrow graft should be seriously considered before the patients have endstage disease. Marrow grafts are technically simple but they may pose enormous problems such as graft versus host reaction (GvH), interstitial pneumonia, graft rejection and leukemic recurrence. Therefore, the procedure should only be performed in highly specialized centers with much knowledge and experience in the immunobiology of bone marrow transplantation.
