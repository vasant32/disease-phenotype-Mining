Aplastic anemia is a failure of all the cellular components of the bone marrow and, untreated, usually results in death from bleeding and/or infection within 4 months. Treatment by bone marrow transplantation offers the only means of survival. When a bone marrow graft fails, the patient is extremely susceptible to severe infection and/or hemorrhage. In this case, a bone marrow transplantation in a 34-year-old white man with aplastic anemia failed. Among the medical problems that subsequently developed were severe, prolonged and life-threatening oral bleeding and infection.
