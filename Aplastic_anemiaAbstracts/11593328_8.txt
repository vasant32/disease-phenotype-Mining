Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is well described in children following liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) secondary to non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Successful immunosuppressive treatment of SAA following liver transplantation has been reported, but death from infectious complications is not uncommon. We report the 8-year follow-up of a 3.5-year-old boy who underwent successful HLA-identical sibling donor bone marrow transplant for SAA 7 months following orthotopic liver transplant for non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. His post-bone marrow transplantation course was uneventful with no evidence of liver toxicity. Eight months following BMT he developed renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lymph nodes which was treated surgically. Six years following BMT he developed a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland also treated surgically. Despite these malignancies, he is currently well 8 years following liver and bone marrow transplantation, without signs of GVHD, growth failure or liver graft rejection. This is the first report of long-term follow-up of bone marrow transplantation for SAA following liver transplantation. The occurrence of two subsequent malignancies in this child underscores the need for close follow-up of future similar cases.
