It is generally appreciated that bone marrow function and growth of myelopoietic cells depends on an intact microvasculature. A pivotal regulator of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we describe analysis of VEGF expression and microvessel density in the bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia by immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow was examined at diagnosis and at the time of hematological remission after immunosuppressive therapy using anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A, and glucocorticoids or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At diagnosis, both VEGF expression and microvessel density were found to be significantly lower in aplastic anemia compared to normal bone marrow (aplastic anemia, 1.1 +/- 0.7 events per field, versus controls, 5.9 +/- 3.0 events per field; P < 0.05). In response to successful therapy, VEGF and microvessel density in the bone marrow increased substantially. Serum VEGF levels were also found to be significantly lower at diagnosis in aplastic anemia compared to healthy controls (aplastic anemia, 51 +/- 35 pg/ml versus controls, 444 +/- 220 pg/ml; P < 0.05). VEGF in the serum increased substantially after successful immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell transplantation (P < 0.05). Taken together, these data show that aplastic anemia is associated with reduced angiogenesis and reduced VEGF expression.
