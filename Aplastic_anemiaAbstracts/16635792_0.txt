We compared the functional status of the hypothalamic dopaminergic tone in patients given an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with that observed in patients with allo-HSCT without chronic GVHD and in healthy controls. The effect of acute dopaminergic blockade with intravenous metoclopramide on serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations was evaluated. Twenty volunteers, 20 to 52 years of age, seronegative for both hepatitis C virus and the human immunodeficiency virus, were studied: (1) 10 clinically healthy men (group 1), and (2) 9 patients with leukemia, and 1 patient with refractory aplastic anemia who underwent allo-HSCT, 5 of whom (3 men and 2 women) developed chronic GVHD (group 2), and 5 (3 men and 2 women) who did not develop chronic GVHD (group 3). Serum PRL concentrations were measured both fasting and after intravenous administration of metoclopramide (10-mg bolus). The area under the PRL curve was calculated. Patients in group 2 were older than those in groups 1 and 3 (P<.018), but their body mass index was similar. Fasting serum PRL concentrations were similar among the 3 groups; however, group 2 had higher PRL concentrations throughout the test (P<.001) and a greater area under the PRL curve than groups 1 and 3 (P<.001), without differences between the last 2 groups. The differences remained significant after adjustment for age (P<.01). Our results in a small group of patients with chronic GVHD after allo-HSCT suggest the existence of an increased functional level of their hypothalamic dopamine tone, which would favor a tendency toward a diminished endogenous production, release of pituitary PRL, or both. This could represent an adaptive mechanism aiming to maintain circulating PRL concentrations within a physiological range.
