 OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of invasive pulmonary fungal infection (IPFI) secondary to malignant blood diseases (MBD). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 52 patients with IPFI secondary to MBD admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1995 to December 2008. RESULTS: The incidences of IPFI secondary to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and aplastic anemia (AA) were 4.6%, 3.2%, 2.8%, and 2.5%, respectively. In patients with IPFI secondary to AML, 88.5% (23/26) of the patients suffered from the infections during the non-remission (NR) period (including relapse), and 11.5% (3/26) in the complete-remission (CR) period. In all the patients with IPFI secondary to malignant blood diseases, 86.5% (45/52) of MBD were neutropenic or agranulocytic, and 67.3% (35/52) had been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 96 hours before anti-fungal therapy. The total mortality after anti-fungal therapy was 13.7% (7/51). More than half of patients with fluconazole or itraconazole as the first-line therapy had to switch to other medicines because of poor infection control. CONCLUSIONS: IPFI secondary to MBD is most common in AML patients. Patients with NR of AML, neutropenia or agranulocytosis, and long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics usage are susceptible to IPFI. Fluconazole and itraconazole have low efficacy, and other more potent anti-fungal medicines should be considered.
