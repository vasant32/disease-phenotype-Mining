To observe normal bone marrow stromal function for supporting hematopoiesis and realize the correlation of bone marrow stromal function in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and anisodamine therapy, normal human marrow CFU-GM was assayed on bone marrow stromal layer (SL) formed on week 3 culture, and the CFU-GM without SL as a control (100%). Results showed that the production of CFU-GM on the normal SL was significantly higher than that of the control. The production of CFU-GM on the SL of 4 AA patients, who responded to anisodamine, was < 80% of the control, and when 2 of them were reexamined for stromal function after treatment, the number of CFU-GM on SL rose up to 168.8% and 249.2% from 38.7% and 39.7% of the control respectively. While in the rest 6 patients, the number of CFU-GM was > 80% of the control, only one patient was improved by anisodamine therapy. So, normal bone marrow stromal layer can obviously support the growth of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells. Anisodamine therapy could be an effective agents for aplastic anemia with stromal dysfunction
