 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for benzene-induced severe aplastic anemia. METHODS: HLA-compatible sibling (pregnancy) allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (Allo-PBSCT) was successfully performed for a patient with severe aplastic anemia caused by benzene poisoning. 9.41 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg, 12.49 x 10(6) CD(34) positive cells/kg and CFU-GM 8.2 x 10(5)/kg were infused. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), total body radiation (8 Gy) and anti-lymphocyte globulin (60 mg/kg) before transplantation. Donor buffy coat cells (9.02 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg, 10.62 x 10(6) CD(34) positive cells/kg, 6.3 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg) were infused again on day 18 after transplantation to prevent from graft failure. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis consisted of both methotrexate and cyclosporin A. RESULTS: The lowest ANC was 0, the lowest platelet was 3 x 10(9)/L after transplantation. The patient achieved an ANC of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L from 21st day, and the platelet of greater than 50 x 10(9)/L from 28th day after transplantation. Grade I cGVHD was found the fourth month after grafting. Examination of recipient's bone marrow cells showed a normal 46, XX (presumably marrow donor) karyotype. Blood group changed from B to O. CONCLUSION: This is the first case reported in China showing a successful treatment of benzene-induced severe aplastic anemia with allo-PBSCT. Allo-PBSCT may be an effective remedy for this kind of patients.
