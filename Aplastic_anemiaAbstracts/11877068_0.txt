OBJECTIVE: To explore more effective regimen for reducing early mortality of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and improving therapeutic effectiveness. METHODS: Antilymphocyte globulin/antithymocyte globulin (ALG/ATG) and cyclosporine A (CsA) (sequential intensified immunosuppressive therapy, SIIST), with or without hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) were administered to 73 SAA patients in a prospective randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the addition of HGFs for the patients. RESULTS: The response rate of SIIST with HGFs group was significantly higher than that of SIIST alone group (89.2% vs 63.9%), with lower rates of early infection (24.3% vs 55.3%) and mortality (4.0% vs 16.7%), shorter duration of cytopenia and blood transfusion dependence and faster recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis. The addition of HGFs to SIIST was tolerated well in all patients. There was no difference in the treatment outcome of the two groups with GM-CSF plus Epo or G-CSF plus Epo. CONCLUSION: The use of HGFs in combination with SIIST could reduce early infection and mortality rates and, therefore, improve the response rates in SAA patients.
