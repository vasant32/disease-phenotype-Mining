Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by intravascular hemolysis leading to anemia and other clinical manifestations. Transfusions are often required to support hemoglobin at tolerable levels. A PNH patient with aplastic anemia was treated with the complement inhibitor eculizumab, followed by concurrent treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Eculizumab alone reduced hemolysis, increased PNH red blood cell (RBC) mass, and decreased transfusions. Addition of rHuEpo during eculizumab therapy, enhanced erythropoiesis, further increased PNH RBC mass and hemoglobin levels, and rendered the patient transfusion independent for more than two years. These data show that driving erythropoiesis during eculizumab treatment provided further benefit to a patient with PNH and underlying bone marrow failure.
