Each nineteen patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at Hyogo College of Medicine between 1980 and 1991. Rejection was one of the major problems for SAA patients. Conditioning regimen including irradiation reduced the rejection rate, but secondary cancers may develop as the dose of irradiation increased. It is practically important to determine the indication of BMT for MDS-refractory anemia (RA). We considered the indication of BMT for those who have abnormal karyotypes and/or life threatening complications. Five out of nine patients with MDS-RA are surviving after BMT. Four out of ten cases with MDS RAEB-T and overt leukemia are alive. BMT should be recommended for patients with MDS who satisfy the above conditions, if suitable donors are available. However, it remains to be determined whether the patients with RAEB or MDS overt leukemia should be treated with chemotherapy prior to the preconditioning for BMT.
