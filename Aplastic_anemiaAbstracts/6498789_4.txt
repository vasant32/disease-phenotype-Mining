Cytogenetic studies in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells from a female patient (aged 31 years) with inherited aplastic anemia and without other congenital anomalies are reported. Endoreduplication was increased in stimulated peripheral lymphocytes in several investigations. Chromosome breaks were shown to be near the control frequency, although chromatid exchange figures and dicentrics were present. Cytogenetic analysis was extended to the three children of our patient. Abnormal clones were detected in bone marrow preparations of our patient in all cytogenetic investigations. At the first examination, two of these clones were prevalent, with their karyotypes being 48,XX, +9, +16 and 46,XX,dup(1)(q24----q32),t(17;?)(p12-13;?). The prevailing karyotype after 2 years was 46,XX,t(17;?)(p12-13;?). Involvement of chromosomes #1 and #17 is discussed, taking into account data from the literature concerning several human neoplasias.
