4 patients (3 female, 1 male) bone marrow transplanted for severe aplastic anemia (3 allogeneic, 1 syngeneic) became pregnant or parented children 19, 37, 81, and 34, 52 months, respectively, after BMT. Conditioning regimen consisted of 200 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide. Donor buffy coat cells were used for rejection prophylaxis, and methotrexate was used as GVHD prophylaxis. 1 female patient developed a mild chronic graft versus host disease with vaginal sclerosis which made a cesarean section necessary. 3 out of 5 pregnancies were uneventful. 1 patient had mumps in the 14th week, another patient had a late abortion in the 25th week of unknown cause. A high incidence of offspring complications was noticed including 1) persistence of fetal circulation syndrome, 2) erythroblastosis fetalis, and 3) prolonged newborn-icterus. These observations confirm previous reports on resumed fertility after BMT for SAA. A relation between the unexpected high incidence of pre-, peri-, and postpartal complications and the BMT procedure can neither be proved nor excluded.
