Engagement of the membrane program death-1 (PD-1) receptor by its ligands suppresses T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Aberrant over-expression of costimulatory molecules, including PD-1, has been associated with persistent activation of self-reactive T cells in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the dysfunction of PD-1 in the regulation of T-cell activation in such diseases remains unclear. Here, we report the overexpression of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell PD-1 and elevated serum levels of soluble PD-1 in aplastic anemia (AA) patients. Detailed characterization of soluble PD-1 revealed that it corresponded to an alternative splice variant PD-1Deltaex3, which lacks the transmembrane domain but has a soluble extracellular domain of the PD-1 molecule. In a further study, PD-1 fusion protein displayed the ability of increasing the proliferation of T cells in vitro, which suggested that soluble PD-1 might serve as an autoimmune antibody to block the function of membrane-bound PD-1 on T cells and lead to aberrant T cell proliferation. Our study revealed a novel pathogenic pathway in which the function of overexpressed PD-1 to restrict over-self-reaction is counteracted by the excessive production of soluble PD-1.
