 BACKGROUND: Modern plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates are produced using various virus-inactivation protocols and are assumed to be safer than they were previously with regard to the risk for transmitting viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The risks from viruses that are relatively resistant to the current inactivation procedures remain uncertain. PATIENT: A 7-year-old with mild hemophilia A who had not been previously infused with any blood products was treated with a plasma-derived, monoclonal antibody-purified factor VIII concentrate to cover orthopedic surgery after traumatic fracture of his left arm. RESULTS: A typical primary human parvovirus (HPV)-B19 infection was observed associated with transient hypoplastic anemia. Retrospective studies including serologic examination and polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the HPV-B19 infection was transmitted by the factor VIII concentrate. CONCLUSIONS: Clotting factor concentrates for the treatment of hemophilia retain a risk for HPV-B19 contamination. HPV-B19 viral infection might induce hypoplastic anemia in these patients, particularly during enhanced hemopoiesis after acute blood loss.
