A 12-year-old boy with aplastic anemia developed severe but reversible cardiac failure after treatment with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (4 x 50 mg/kg on four consecutive days) given as preparation for bone marrow grafting. This and previously reported cases demonstrate the possibility of cardiotoxicity after high doses of the drug.
