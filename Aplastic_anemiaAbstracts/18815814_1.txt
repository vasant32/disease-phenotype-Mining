Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) has been associated with primary immunological disorders, such as lymphoma and thymoma. While several different explanations have been proposed, much of the literature has implicated activated T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis. We report a patient with minimal change nephrotic syndrome presenting concurrently with thrombocytopenia and anemia, with a subsequent diagnosis of aplastic anemia. To our knowledge, this is the first such case described in the literature.
