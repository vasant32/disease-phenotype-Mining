Diagnosis of erythrovirus B19 relies on serology and the detection of viral DNA. These techniques were believed to detect all field isolates because erythrovirus B19 has been known to undergo little genetic variation (1-2%). Recently, a distinct erythrovirus isolate termed V9, markedly different from erythrovirus B19 (>11% nucleotide disparity), was isolated from a child in France suffering from transient aplastic anemia. Standard PCR assays and serological tests failed to demonstrate an acute erythrovirus B19 infection. Subsequent sequencing of the erythrovirus V9 genome shows that the nucleotide discrepancies encompass the entire genome, indicating that standard erythrovirus B19 PCR assays will not reliably detect erythrovirus V9 DNA. As a tool for studying the epidemiological role and medical importance of this erythrovirus variant, a PCR assay is described that allows simultaneous detection of, and distinction between, erythrovirus B19 and the V9 isolate. Examination of 100 erythrovirus B19 IgM positive samples as well as plasma pools representing 100,000 Danish blood donor units for the presence of B19 and V9 DNA was performed. Despite the apparent absence of erythrovirus V9 in the clinical samples at present, the DNA sequence variability demonstrates that the erythrovirus group may be more divergent than thought previously and the child harboring this isolate may herald erythrovirus V9 as a possible emerging virus.
