OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence and characteristics of documented infections in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (UD-BMT). METHODS: We studied the occurrence of infections in 22 patients with hematologic malignancies or severe aplastic anemia who underwent UD-BMT from April 1990 to December 2000. The median age was 26 years (range 13-46). Acyclovir-ganciclovir, co-trimoxazole, fluconazole-nystatin and ciprofloxacin were administered for anti-infectious prophylaxis. RESULTS: We registered 61 infectious episodes. During the early post-transplant period, there were eight clinically documented infections (CDIs), four cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO), seven cases of bacteremia, two cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia, and one case of CMV disease. In the intermediate period (days 30-100 after BMT), there were nine cases of CMV antigenemia, three bacterial infections, two fungal infections, one case of disseminated toxoplasmosis, and one case of FUO. In the late period (day 100 and later), we documented 13 viral infections, eight bacterial infections, one CDI, and one case of invasive aspergillosis. Infections contributed to death in 10 of 17 patients. Citrobacter bacteremia and sepsis of unknown origin were the main causes of infectious mortality in the early period. Infection was the main cause of death in six of seven patients in the late period. CONCLUSION: A high incidence of life-threatening infections and infection-related mortality was observed. A high rate of CMV infection in the early period, and death caused by multiresistant Gram-negative microorganisms in the late period, were the main findings in this series.
