Hematologic complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) usually involve peripheral destruction of blood cells. We report a case of aplastic anemia associated with SLE observed during the remission phase of SLE 3 months after the beginning of treatment. CD8+ T cells in the patient's bone marrow may have suppressed maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which may have induced the aplastic anemia associated with SLE. Repeated therapy with high-dose methylprednisolone resulted in lasting remission.
