A 16-year-old boy with aplastic anemia that was resistant to treatment with androgens and prednisone and that had a high transfusion requirement was treated with antilymphocyte globulin. A complete normalization of the hematologic values was obtained. The result supports the theory of immune pathogenesis in some cases of aplastic anemia.
