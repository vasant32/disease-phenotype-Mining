 OBJECTIVE: To measure the telomere length in patients with bone marrow failure syndrome (BMF) using fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (Flow-FISH). METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 8 patients with BMF. Telomere lengths of mononuclear cells from 8 BMF patients and granulocytes from 3 of these 8 BMF patients (all these 3 patients were suffered from aplastic anemia) were measured using Flow-FISH, and the results were compared with those of normal controls. Telomere lengths were measured by Southern blot in 3 patients, and the results were compared with those obtained from Flow-FISH. RESULTS: Among these 8 BMF patients, 5 have decreased telomere length in their mononuclear cells. However, different white cell subgroups, specifically mononucleated cells and granulocytes, have different degree of telomere shortening. In 3 BMF patients who underwent both Flow-FISH and Southern blot, 2 patients had consistent measurement results. CONCLUSION: Flow-FISH can be used for the measurement of telomere length in Chinese patients with BMF.
