Clinicopathologic features of 45 patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to massive or submassive hepatic necrosis were studied. Both percutaneous biopsies and liver explants were available in 23 patients, whole livers only in 11 cases, and biopsies only in 11 cases. An etiologic diagnosis was established in 16 cases (36%). A further 3 cases (7%) were associated with aplastic anemia. Established etiologies included drug reactions (n = 7); autoimmune hepatitis, type 2 (n = 3); halothane hepatitis (n = 1); ischemia/hypotension (n = 1); mushroom poisoning (n = 1); mitochondrial disorder (n = 1); hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 1); and adenoviral hepatitis (n = 1). The extent of necrosis on liver biopsy correlated poorly with that in liver explants (mean difference, 32% +/- 23.8%). Almost all cases could be classified into one of 2 broad patterns of necrosis, namely, (1) zonal coagulative necrosis or (2) panlobular (nonzonal) necrosis. These patterns differed significantly with respect to several clinical parameters including sex ratio, peripheral blood white cell count, serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, conjugated bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels. Livers with panlobular necrosis showed a spectrum of histopathologic findings that included central venulitis (76%), lymphocytic infiltration of large duct/gallbladder epithelium (54%), and syncytial giant cell transformation (18%). These features were not seen in livers with zonal coagulative necrosis which frequently showed prominent steatosis (91%). Both patterns of necrosis frequently showed ductular proliferation (100%) and cholangiolitis (80%). The diagnostic yield of ancillary studies (histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy) was very low (<1%). The small proportion of cases with etiologic diagnoses precluded correlation of clinical and histopathological parameters with specific etiologies. In summary, this study describes the spectrum of changes seen in massive and submassive necrosis in children and identifies clinical features that might differentiate between 2 broad patterns of necrosis.
