Frequent blood transfusions are necessary in aplastic anemia because of decreased hematopoietic function. In order to maintain the hemoglobin level and to decrease the need for blood transfusion, human ceruloplasmin was used for the treatment of 73 patients with aplastic anemia. A marked beneficial effect was obtained in 16 cases. The treatment was moderately effective in 17 cases, slightly effective in eight cases, and ineffective in 32 cases. The usual dose of ceruloplasmin was 15 mg/day, but it was varied according to symptoms. Side effects were minimal when ceruloplasmin was administered by slow intravenous injection.
