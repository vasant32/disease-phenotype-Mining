Pulmonary function was studied prospectively in 25 children with leukemia and aplastic anemia undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Whereas 11 patients have died, only one did so primarily due to interstitial pneumonia. Fourteen patients (56%) survived a median of at least 36 months. Seventeen patients received pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Four patients transplanted for leukemia in relapse following preparation with a very intensive regimen (cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, total body irradiation, 1,000 rad, BCNU, cytosine arabinoside) developed restrictive lung changes. Patients undergoing BMT for aplastic anemia and leukemia in remission prepared with more commonly used and less intensive regimens maintained normal pulmonary function. As new regimens are devised, PFTs should be utilized to characterize the pulmonary toxicity of these regimens as well.
