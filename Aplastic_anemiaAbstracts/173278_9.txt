The effect that breeder-flock immune status regarding the infectious bursal agent (IBA) and two avian adenoviruses (DPI-1 and DPI-2) has on the susceptibility of their commercially reared Delmarva broiler progeny to the hemorrhagic-aplastic-anemia syndrome and concurrent gangrenous dermatitis was determined. Lack of immunity to the IBA in breeder flocks was related to an increased susceptibility of progeny to anemia and dermatitis. Breeder-flock immunity to the two adenoviruses tested could not be related to the resistance or susceptibility of their progeny to the hemorrhagic-aplastic-anemia syndrome and gangrenous dermatitis.
