Drug-induced dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia) in Sweden during a 10-year period (1966-75) have been analyzed. The overall occurrence is remarkably constant, although marked changes have occurred with regard to offending drugs. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis are about twice as common as hemolytic anemia, which in turn is twice as common as aplastic anemia. There is a marked increase with age in the incidence of all drug-induced cytopenias. Women predominate and make up close to 70% of the material. With regard to responsible drugs, the most remarkable finding is the high frequency with which sulfonamides appear as responsible for all types of drug-induced cytopenia.
