Of the 31 cases of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation performed in the past 4 years at the National Taiwan University Hospital, 25 evaluable cases were retrospectively studied for incidence, severity, and risk factors of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The incidence was 60% (15/25) with the proportion of severe form (greater than or equal to grade II) being 53% (8/15). Skin involvement was the most common (13/15), gut the second (5/15), and liver the third (4/15). Most of the diagnosis of skin disease were confirmed by biopsy. Acute GVHD accounted for 3 deaths directly and was the next most common cause of death in post-transplant patients. The long-term survival rate for cases with grade 0-I disease was 65%, and that for those with grade II-III disease was 38%. Multivariate linear regression analysis of risk factors associated with severe form GVHD showed that the diagnosis of aplastic anemia was the most significant factor. Total lymphoid irradiation with or without plasmapheresis in aplastic anemia might contribute to the occurrence of severe acute GVHD.
