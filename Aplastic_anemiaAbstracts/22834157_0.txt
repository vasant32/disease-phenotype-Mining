In most cases the immediate cause of lethal outcomes of aplastic anemia is increased hemorrhage. The multifactorial causality of development of hemorrhagic syndrome is to be taken into account to receive informative and accessible characteristics in assessing the state of homeostasis system in patients with aplastic anemia during acute period of disease. The comprehensive analysis of homeostasis system indicators during acute course of aplastic anemia established such characteristic alterations as the presence of signs of activation of homeostasis system, decrease of factor XIII level, inhibition of fibrinolysis system, qualitative deficiency of platelets in peripheral blood. Hence their significance in pathogenesis of hemorrhage in patients with aplastic anemia is approved.
