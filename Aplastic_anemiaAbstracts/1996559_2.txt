Serum albumin, cholinesterase, and cholesterol were measured in ten patients with aplastic anemia and eight with myelodysplastic syndrome who received the administration of recombinant human GM-CSF. Serum albumin, cholinesterase, and cholesterol were significantly lowered by the administration of GM-CSF and recovered after the cessation of GM-CSF. These data suggest that GM-CSF impairs the biosynthesis of liver cells and that cholesterol-lowering activity of GM-CSF, which is previously reported, is due to the impairment of liver biosynthesis by GM-CSF.
