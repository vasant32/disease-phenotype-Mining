Unlike hemopoietic cell, stromal cells of aplastic anemia patients' bone marrow undergo pathological shifts. This has been proved by ultrastructural investigations which showed intranuclear inclusions structurally similar to virus bodies. The latter are divided into three types this allowing follow-up of the inclusions to mature forms seen in the stromal cells cytoplasm. The findings suggest primary viral affection of stromal cellular elements of aplastic anemia patients' bone marrow. The attention is also drawn to ultrastructural shifts recorded in adipose cells in aplastic anemia.
