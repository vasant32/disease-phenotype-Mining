This study was designed to evaluate the utility of blasts with a clear halo around their nucleoli (BCHN) as a predictive indicator of disease progression in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and aplastic anemia (AA). Bone marrow aspirates from 75 patients with MDSs and 18 with AA were fixed in 95% ethanol solution or 10% neutral formalin and stained with the Papanicolaou method. BCHNs were detected in 57 of 75 patients with MDSs and in 10 of 18 AA patients. Disease progression was restrictedly observed in 17 patients with MDSs who had BCHNs at onset and in 1 patient with AA. The proportion of BCHNs increased with disease progression in these 16 of 17 patients with MDSs. The presence of BCHNs at onset and the increase in proportion of BCHNs during the clinical course of MDSs were significant indications for predicting disease progression.
