 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: Twelve patients with severe AA (SAA) and 4 with chronic AA (CAA) received allo- HSCT. The effectiveness and complication were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Hematopoiesis reconstitution was achieved 14 patients (87.50%). The median time of neutrophils reached to 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets reached to 20 x 10(9)/L were 14 (11 - 16) and 14 (10 - 33) days, respectively. Six cases developed grade I - II acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic local GVHD occurred in 2 patients. Graft rejection occurred in 3 cases. Thirteen cases survived with a median of 10 (0.5 - 84) months at the end of follow-up. Three cases died of un-engraftment, graft rejection (GR) and interstitial pneumonia (IP) each. CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT is an effective therapy for patients with AA. Enhancing immunosuppressive treatment for conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of GR and GVHD.
