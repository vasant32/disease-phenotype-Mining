A 47-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had been treated with greater than 7 g of gold sodium thiomalate over a 5 year period when aplastic anemia developed. Treatment with corticosteroids, plasmapheresis and infusion of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) resulted in complete hematologic remission. Infusion of NAC increased daily urinary excretion of gold and use of an ambulatory infusion pump with a Hickman catheter allowed protracted outpatient infusion for more than 4 months' duration. It is now 20 months since the onset of aplastic anemia and she remains in complete hematologic remission.
