OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between serum level of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and clinical status, treatment outcome and prognosis in severe aplastic anemia (SAA-I) patients. METHODS: Serum G-CSF level was detected by ELISA assay in 36 SAA-I patients. RESULTS: Pre-treatment serum G-CSF levels of 27/36 (75%) SAA-I patients were above normal. These patients achieved better curative outcomes in a shorter period of treatment. CONCLUSION: Detection of serum G-CSF level in SAA-I patients is helpful for judging the clinical status and prognosis.
