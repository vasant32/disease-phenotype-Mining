OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effects of Yishen Shengxue tablet (YSSXT) on aplastic anemia. METHODS: All patients were divided into two groups by simple randomized methods, 106 patients of the treatment group were treated with YSSXT, 36 patients of the control groups were treated with Renshen Guipi Pill (RSGPP). Peripheral blood and bone marrow of the two groups of patients were measured before and after treatment. The toxicity and side effects of YSSXT were also observed. RESULTS: The basical cure rate, remission rate, total effective rate of the treatment and control groups were 23.6%, 36.8%, 82.1% and 11.1%, 22.2%, 58.3% respectively. There was significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). The effect of treatment group was obviously better than that of control group. Follow up study showed that from onset of the disease to follow up time in the treatment group, the longest one was 18 years 4 months, so the long-term curative effect is promising. During the period of clinical observation, no obvious side effect and toxicity of YSSXT were found. CONCLUSION: YSSXT is an effective and safe drug in treating aplastic anemia. It has a good prospect and application.
