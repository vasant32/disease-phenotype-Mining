: Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare entity characterized by symmetrical and painful thickness and induration of the skin, especially localized on forearms and thorax and generally accompanied by eosinophilia. Although several reports indicate the relationship between EF and hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia, polycythemia vera, or myelomonocytic leukemia, the association with lymphomas is extremely rare. Only a few cases of EF have been previously described preceding or concomitant to the Hodgkin disease, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, and mycosis fungoides. We report for the first time a 76-year-old man with an EF associated with a peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified. We review the relationship between both conditions. In conclusion, we present a unique case of EF as a manifestation of a T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified. The present case demonstrates the importance of clinical and radiological studies in those cases of EF to rule out a visceral, lymph node, or cutaneous lymphoma.
