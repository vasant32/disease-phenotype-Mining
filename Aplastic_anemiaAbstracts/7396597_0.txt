Marathon runners are subject to many unique physical problems, especially blistering of the feet. Once the feet have become blistered, some runners use rubber cement, which contains benzene as an impurity, to keep adhesive tape in place over the denuded areas while running. We report the case of a marathon runner who used rubber cement in this fashion for more than one year in whom aplastic anemia developed.
