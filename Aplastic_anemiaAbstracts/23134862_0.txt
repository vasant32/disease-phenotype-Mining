 OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes of regulatory T (Treg) cells and Th17 cells in a novel mouse severe aplastic anemia (SAA) model induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) combined with busulphan (BU), and to demonstrate the rationality of the model in immunology level. METHODS: The BALB/c female mice SAA model was constructed by intraperitoneal injection with IFN-γ and intragastric administration with BU (combined group), with BU group, IFN-γ group and normal group as controls. After collecting the mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and spleen of mice in each group, the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in the mononuclear cells were detected by flow cytometry(FCM), and to analyze the changes. RESULTS: The percentage of the Treg cells in PB and spleen was (3.19 ± 0.76)% and (4.77 ± 1.05)% respectively in combined group, being significantly lower than in other three groups (all P < 0.01). The percentage of the Th17 cells in PB and spleen was (2.07 ± 0.12)% and (3.18 ± 0.46)% respectively in combined group, being significantly higher than that in other three groups (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lower Treg cells and higher Th17 cells was found in the novel mouse SAA model induced by IFN-γ combined with BU, which demonstrates that this SAA model may be more close to the human immune-mediated marrow failure.
