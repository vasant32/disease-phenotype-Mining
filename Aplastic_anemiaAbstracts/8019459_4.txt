Allogeneic BMT for severe aplastic anemia is associated with a significant rate of graft rejection, especially in patients who have been previously transfused. We report a child with aplastic anemia who rejected donor marrow twice despite adequate immunosuppression as part of the conditioning therapy but engrafted successfully following combined administration of three modalities of immunosuppression: antithymocyte globulin, total lymphoid irradiation and the monoclonal antibody Campath-1G. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies > 1 year after BMT show full donor hematopoiesis with no evidence of autologous recovery.
