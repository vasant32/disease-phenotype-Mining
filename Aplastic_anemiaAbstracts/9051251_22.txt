Chronic restrictive lung disease in a 9-year-old boy with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) 7 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is described. When he was 1 year and 10 months old, severe aplastic anemia developed. He received a marrow transplant from his HLA serologically identical, but HLA-DP mismatched brother. He developed grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and thereafter chronic GVHD of progressive type, and was treated with both prednisolone and azathioprine resulting in clinical improvement. Thereafter he complained of dyspnea, and bilateral noncircumscribed interstitial shadows on chest CT scan were present. His pulmonary function showed restrictive changes. Prednisolone was not effective and he died of respiratory failure. Post-mortem examination confirmed interstitial fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltration of the bronchioles and alveoli with luminal fibrosis. There was no evidence of chronic GVHD in the skin and the liver. These findings raise the possibility that this pulmonary complication was associated with DC itself.
