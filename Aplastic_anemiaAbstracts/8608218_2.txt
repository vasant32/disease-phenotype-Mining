Endogenous plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentrations were serially measured in 68 patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA). A very sensitive chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLEIA) was used to measure the plasma G-CSF concentration. The minimum detection limit of this assay (0.5 pg/mL) was sufficient for the determination of G-CSF concentrations in patients and normal subjects. The plasma G-CSF concentrations were significantly higher in 51 AA patients without signs of infection as compared with healthy control subjects. In AA patients with signs of infection, the G-CSF concentrations appeared to increase during the acute phase. There was a significant negative correlation between plasma G-CSF concentrations and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in AA patients without signs of infection. Although a decrease in the plasma G-CSF concentration was observed in all patients who achieved self-sustaining hematopoiesis following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or immunosuppressive (IS) therapy, it was lower in patients undergoing BMT as compared with those receiving IS therapy for any given degree of neutropenia. Plasma G-CSF concentrations were higher in patients responding to IS therapy than in nonresponders. This study demonstrated the negative feedback regulation of G-CSF that plasma G-CSF concentrations may be useful in predicting the clinical response to IS therapy.
