Clinical effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation has been analyzed in 83 patients with aplastic anemia. Bone marrow of non-related donors with high degree of histocompatibility, according to the antigen system HLA of loci A, B, C and DR, was used. Freshly prepared bone marrow was transplanted in doses from 3.4 x 10(9) to 15 x 10(9) myelokaryocytes. Immunosuppression was provided by corticosteroid hormones and antithymocytic globulin. Complete or partial remission lasting for more than a year was recorded in 56 patients. Formed elements of the donor's blood were detected in the blood of 39% of the patients (the observation period lasted from 1 to 8 months). Symptoms of a secondary disease were observed in 29% of the patients. Significant changes in the cellular immunity parameters were recorded in all the patients investigated. The character of the time course of these changes may serve as a prognostic factor of myelotherapy effectiveness.
