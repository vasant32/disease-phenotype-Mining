1. The gamma chain composition of 17 patients with varying degrees of bone marrow failure was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. All 10 patients with anemia had high G gamma levels (48.1-68.5%), while 5/7 patients in remission had G gamma in the range 30.0-38.8%. 2. There was also an association of higher G gamma values with higher HbF levels. The average value of G gamma in the HbF of patients with active aplastic or hypoplastic anemia differed from those obtained both for normal adult and for newborn HbF. 3. Thus, in spite of activation of both the G gamma and A gamma genes, the former are more effectively expressed as HbF increases.
