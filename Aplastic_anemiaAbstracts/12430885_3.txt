We have used a novel method to conduct non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST), making the following changes in previous methods: Use of the cheapest conditioning drugs, tailored number of apheresis sessions in the donors, elimination of ganciclovir and IgG, outpatient conduction when possible, diminished number of transfusions of blood products and diminished number of donor lymphocyte infusions. With this method, we have prospectively conducted 70 allografts in patients with different diseases: Chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplasia, thalassemia major, relapsed Hodgkins disease, Blackfan-Diamond syndrome and aplastic anemia. In them, the median granulocyte recovery time to 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 11 d, whereas the median platelet recovery time to 20 x 10(9)/L was 12 d. Twenty patients did not need red blood cell transfusions and 17 did not need platelet transfusions. In 55 individuals (78%), the procedure could be completed fully on an outpatient basis. Follow-up times range between 30 and 800 d.: Four patients failed to engraft and recovered endogenous hemopoiesis; 16 patients (23%) developed acute graft versus-host disease (GVHD) whereas 28 (49%) developed chronic GVHD. Thirty two patients (47%) have died: 21 with a relapsing disease and seven as a result of GVHD; the median post-trasplant survival (SV) was 420 d., whereas the 12-mo. SV was 42%. The 100-day mortality was 3.8% and the transplant-related mortality was 14.2%. The median cost of the allografts was 18,000.00 US dollars. This method could be particularly adequate in developing countries, where very few individuals can afford the cost of a conventional bone marrow transplantation procedure.
