OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of elevating efficacy for aplastic anemia (AA) by using blood-activating and stasis-eliminating drugs. METHODS: Immune-induced aplastic anemia model was established. Each mouse was gastrogavaged by 0.2 ml 100% composite blood-activating decoction (CBAD) twice a day. On the 10th day, the bone marrow histology, CFU-F, adhesive function of the cultured stromal cell layer, bone marrow PO2 were observed. RESULTS: In CBAD group, the WBC count, bone marrow karyocytes, bone marrow hematopoietic tissue volume, CFU-F count were significantly higher than those in AA group (P < 0.01). Moreover, the adhesive function of stromal cells and bone marrow PO2 recovered to normal level. CONCLUSION: The commonly used composite blood-activating decoction could promote the recovery and oxygen-supply of bone marrow microenvironment in AA mice, and improved the bone marrow hematopoiesis.
