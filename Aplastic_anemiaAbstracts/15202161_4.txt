Human parvovirus B19 (PVB19) infection may cause mild pancytopenia characterized by transient and spontaneous recovery in healthy subjects. Severe aplastic anemia associated with PVB19 infection in patients without an underlying disease has been described in a number of reports. Here, a previous healthy, 10-year-old girl with severe aplastic anemia associated with PVB19 infection is described. The patient underwent bone marrow transplantation from her HLA-identical sibling resulting in complete recovery. PVB19 infection should be considered as one of the causes of aplastic anemia in patients without an underlying disease.
