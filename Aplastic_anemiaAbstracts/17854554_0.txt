 OBJECTIVE: Adopting methods of cell culture to explore the effects and mechanisms of Jianpi Bushen Huoxue Prescription (JPBSHXP), a traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine for strengthening spleen, reinforcing kidney and activating blood circulation, in inhibiting hematopoietic cells apoptosis in a mouse model of aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: Blood serum of AA mice was made from an AA mouse model. Blood serums containing different traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine were made from rats after intragastric administration of JPBSHXP and its related decoctions, respectively. Bone marrow cells of normal mice were incubated by these blood serums for 24 hours, respectively. The apoptosis of the bone marrow cells were assayed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: It was indicated that the bone marrow cells of normal mice incubated with blood serum of AA mice displayed typical apoptosis. The apoptosis rates of bone marrow cells of the AA mice incubated by blood serum containing different traditional Chinese herbal medicine were decreased. The effect of Bushen (reinforcing kidey) Recipe was better than Jianpi (strengthening spleen) Recipe and Huoxue (activating blood circulation) Recipe, while the effect of JPBSHXP was the best. TEM results showed that the effect of Bushen Recipe was better than that of the Jianpi Recipe and the Huoxue Recipe, while the effect of JPBSHXP was the best. CONCLUSION: JPBSHXP and its related decoctions can significantly decrease the apoptosis rate of bone marrow mononuclear cells of the AA mice. It is inferred that JPBSHXP can promote bone marrow hematogenesis.
