To explore the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) CD11a and CD49d in patients with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) and its clinical implications, the expression of CD11a and CD49d in mononuclear cell (MNC) of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) were measured using APAAP techniques in 20 patients with CAA before and after SSL/C therapy. The results showed that the expression of CD11a and CD49d in MNC of BM and CD11a in MNC of PB increased significantly (P < 0.05) after SSL/C therapy, and there was no significant change of CD49d in MNC of PB in both groups. In conclusion, the decrease of CAMs of CD11a and CD49d participated in the pathogenesis of CAA. The expression of CAMs increases with effective treatment, so the restoration or improvement of altered CAMs of CAA might be beneficial to the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell, and improvement of hematopoiesis in CAA.
