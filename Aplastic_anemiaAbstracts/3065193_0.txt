Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is now increasingly applied not only to hematologic disorders such as leukemias and aplastic anemia but also to some of solid tumors. We experienced ten cases of bone marrow harvest and six cases of autologous or allogeneic BMT during the period from June, 1986 to August, 1987. For autologous BMT cases, bone marrow cells were harvested and cryopreserved at -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen tank and colony forming assays were examined to ascertain the colony forming ability of harvested bone marrow stem cells. Recovery of colony forming ability after cryopreservation in colony forming unit in culture and burst forming unit in erythrocyte is about 63 to 73% and well preserved. Among 6 cases undergone BMT, five cases are patients with advanced solid tumors including breast cancer, seminoma, lung cancer, malignant lymphoma and brain tumor and these 5 cases have undergone autologous BMT. Conditioning regimen for each cancer in autologous BMT differs based upon conventional chemotherapy regimen and two to four fold dose of conventionally used chemotherapy regimen were administered and after two or three days of high dose chemotherapy, cryopreserved bone marrow cells were thawed and infused. Peripheral white blood cells and platelets were recovered to more than 1000/microliters and 5 x 10(4)/microliters, respectively, within 21 days after bone marrow cell infusion. Disappearance or decrease in tumor size was observed in all cases except brain tumor even though those cases were advanced ones. After autologous BMT, recurrence occurred within three to five months in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
