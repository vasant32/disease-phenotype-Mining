The clinical effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF), produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells, was studied in 27 patients with childhood neutropenias. The sample consisted of 8 patients with congenital neutropenia (Kostmann type), 9 with neutropenia with miscellaneous causes (5 chronic benign, 2 associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, 1 drug-induced, and 1 hypoplastic type), 3 with cyclic neutropenia, and 7 with severe aplastic anemia. The rG-CSF was given subcutaneously (or in a few cases intravenously) at a dose of 2 micrograms/kg/day for 7 days and 5 micrograms/kg/day for additional 7 to 28 days in cases with poor response. The rG-CSF was effective in 18 of 27 cases (67%). Patients with congenital neutropenia and aplastic anemia responded less frequently and poorly. The mean level of absolute neutrophil counts of 8 congenital neutropenia cases increased from 88/microliters to 2,718/microliters. That of 9 miscellaneous cases changed from 189/microliters to 7,224/microliters at a dose of 2 micrograms/kg/day. In 7 aplastic anemia cases pretreatment level of 220/microliters rose to 851/microliters, usually after increasing the dose up to 5 micrograms/kg/day. The rG-CSF was apparently effective in 3 cases of cyclic neutropenia. In any type of neutropenia, the effect was largely transient; after the discontinuation of rG-CSF, the absolute neutrophil counts tended to decrease to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 weeks. The G-CSF was well tolerated, and only one case with mild lumbago and another with minimal elevation of transaminases were observed. We conclude that the rG-CSF can be effective for treating various types of childhood neutropenia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
