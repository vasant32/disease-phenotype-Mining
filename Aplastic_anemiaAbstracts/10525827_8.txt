We measured serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin (IL)-11, and IL-6 in 90 different samples from 67 pediatric patients with thrombocytopenia (TP). The cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and the biological activity of TPO was measured using a cell line transfected with human c-mpl. In patients with impaired megakaryocytopoiesis, as found in diseases such as aplastic anemia, amegakaryocytic TP, or TP with absent radii, we found TPO levels which were highly elevated compared with normal values (mean=261 AU/ml, n=52, vs. 22 AU/ml in healthy controls). In contrast, patients suffering from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (mean=16 AU/ml, n=31) or platelet function defects (mean=23 AU/ml, n=7) demonstrated normal TPO levels. The biological activity tested in the bioassay correlated well with the ELISA data. However, sera of some patients with amegakaryocytic TP demonstrated a remarkably higher biological activity of TPO than expected from the ELISA data. Within the different groups there was no correlation between platelet counts and TPO levels. Only 27% of all samples had elevated levels of IL-11 (mean=450 pg/ml, n=20). Elevated IL-6 serum levels were detected in only 13% of all samples analyzed (mean=42 pg/ml, n=12). We conclude that megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated mainly by TPO, that it is dependent on the platelet and the megakaryocytic mass, and that IL-11 plays an additional role in supporting the platelet production. IL-6 does not appear to be up-regulated in children with thrombocytopenia.
