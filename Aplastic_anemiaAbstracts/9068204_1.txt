BACKGROUND: Approximately one-fourth of patients who could benefit from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are served by a genotypically identical sibling donor. When patients do not have an HLA-matched donor, alternative marrow sources should be explored. The way to allow survival in some patients is to perform two- or three loci HLA mismatched BMT. Preliminary results with BMT in partially-matched, related donors performed at Veterans General Hospital-Taipei are reported. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1994, a total of 121 patients were enrolled in this study. Ten patients received BMT with HLA partially-matched, related donor, including 2 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 5 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and 3 severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Three and four hematologically malignant patients received cyclophosphamide (Cy) + radiotherapy (RT) and Cy + Busulfan(Bu) preconditioning regimens, respectively; three SAA patients received standard Cy + RT regimen. Additional prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) consisted of methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporin-A (CSA). The median follow up was 36 months. Seven were 2-loci disparate and 3 were 3-loci. RESULTS: Engraftment developed with a mean of 20.9 days after transplant. Nonengraftment rate was 1/10 (10%), delayed graft failure 2/10(20%) and venoocculsive disease (VOD) 1/10(10%). The percentage of patients who developed grade II to IV acute GVHD was low (13.6% of those mismatched at 0 locus, 31.6% mismatched at 1 loci and 14.3% at > or = 2 loci. p = 0.181). Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 16.7% (34.1% of those mismatched at 0 locus, 41.2% mismatched at 1 loci and 16.7% at 2 loci. p = 0.492). There were five deaths. The other 5 still survived at 36 months of follow-up. Log-rank analysis revealed no statistical significance between those mismatched at > or = 2 vs at 1 (p = 0.146) but the difference between those mismatched at > or = 2 and at 0 (p = 0.0359) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: When patients requiring BMT without an HLA identical sibling donor, an alternative transplant from haploidentical family members remains a viable option, especially when a patient has CML, SAA or other refractory hematologic malignancies.
