Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) was administered to 14 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and seven patients with aplastic anemia (AA). In 19 patients, doses of 6000 units were given intravenously three times a week (t.i.w.) with the dose being doubled up to 24,000 units every 8 weeks until a response was obtained. RhEpo was given subcutaneously in two patients. Seven patients, four with MDS and three with AA, showed a significant response with an increase of hemoglobin concentration during therapy. The response occurred at doses of 12,000 units in five and 24,000 units in two patients. Responding patients with both MDS and AA had a relatively low serum Epo (s-Epo) level prior to Epo therapy. MDS responders had either refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS), while two of the Epo responders in AA had a severe form of the disease. However, since some of the Epo responders had a high initial s-Epo concentration, a high s-Epo level does not preclude the use of rhEpo. Serial determination of s-Epo levels showed a progressive decline in six of the seven responders even when they were on rhEpo therapy, while the s-Epo levels remained elevated or further increased with time in most nonresponders. RhEpo was well tolerated by all patients. The results suggest that rhEpo is a safe and effective treatment for a certain proportion of patients with MDS and AA. Moreover, serial determination of s-Epo during therapy may be useful in monitoring and predicting the therapeutic effect of rhEpo.
