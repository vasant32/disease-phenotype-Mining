Although described initially in children, typhlitis is an important clinical condition that may also occur in adults with hematologic malignancy or, less commonly, aplastic anemia. We describe 6 adult patients with typhlitis and review the salient features of this condition. In typhlitis, a necrotizing process of multifactorial origin involves the right colon alone or the right colon and other areas of the intestine as well. Secondary colonization of mucosal ulcers by colonic flora commonly leads to septicemia and pyrexia. Typhlitis may be associated with a variety of clinical and radiographic findings. However, a high index of suspicion and certain constellations of clinical and radiographic findings may lead to an accurate presumptive diagnosis of typhlitis, followed by the institution of appropriate therapy. Notwithstanding, the short-term prognosis for typhlitis remains poor.
