The main purpose of the present study was to determine the response rate to immunosuppressive therapy combined with recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and its efficacy for preventing infections in patients with severe aplastic anemia. The treatments included one course of antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A, methylprednisolone, danazole and rhG-CSF. Three patients had very severe aplastic anemia and two had moderate aplastic anemia. One patient relapsed 13 months following the first course of therapy and received a second course. Five patients received six courses of treatment and the response rate at 6 months was 83.3%. All patients achieved an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L within 40 days. All patients with a complete response are transfusion-free and doing well. All five patients are currently alive and have not had any episode of infection for 17-53 months. The results of the study indicate that this therapy may improve the poor prognosis of young patients with severe aplastic anemia. It has a good response rate and induces a rather rapid increase in the neutrophil count, which protects against life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections.
