To explore the effects of infusion with human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow on bone marrow hematopoietic function and survival in mice with aplastic anemia (AA), immuno-mediated aplastic anemia mice model was established according to Yao's method. Thirty BALB/c female mice were divided into AA model group, MSC group and radiation group. In MSC group, 1 x 10(6) MSC was infused by intravenous injection at 3 days after establishment of model. The changes of blood count, the number of nuclear cells in a single thigh-bone, colony-forming units (CFU), pathological features of bone marrow and survival rate of mice were observed in all groups. The results showed that the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood of AA model group at day 7 after establishment of model was (0.65 +/- 0.05) x 10(9)/L, which was significantly lower than those in MSC group and radiation alone group, respectively. Pancytopenia was found in all three groups at day 10. At day 14 the pancytopenia was continued in AA model group while it was less severe in MSC and radiation groups. In MSC group the number of nucleated cells in single thigh bone and pathological slice as well as CFU-GM were significantly higher than those in AA model group, respectively. The survival rate of mice in MSC group was 80.0% which was higher than that of group in AA model (18.2%, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between MSC group and radiation alone group in bone marrow hematopoiesis and survival rate. It is concluded that MSC infusion reduces the degree of bone marrow failure and improve survival of immuno-mediated AA mice model.
