Made in Russia antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) was given to 43 patients with aplastic anemia (AA). 56% of the patients responded, 30% reached a complete or partial remission. 5-year actuarial survival of ALG-treated patients was 52% (44 and 60% for severe and non-severe forms). The data on ALG efficacy suggest its benefits in first-line therapy of both severe and non-severe AA as well as in management of patients resistant to other methods of immunosuppressive treatment.
