160 Kunming mice were divided at random into 3 groups. Group 1: normal control (40 mice). Group 2: aplastic anemia (AA) control (60 mice); benzene inhalation was carried out for 2.5 months and sterilized normal saline was injected i.p. for another 6 weeks. Group 3: treated AA (60 mice); benzene was administered by inhalation in a similar manner, Sheng-Mai Injection (SMI) was administered i.p. for 6 weeks after the AA models were established. SMI is a famous Chinese traditional prescription of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (0.1 g/ml), Ophiopogon japonicus (Thunb.) Ker-Gawl (0.312 g/ml) and Fructus Schisandrae (0.158 g/ml). Activities of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase in BFU-Es and CFU-Es were estimated by ion pair reversed phase HPLC (IPrHPLC). Accompanying the sharp drop in counts of erythroid progenitor cells, the PRPP synthetase activity in CFU-Es of AA mice was reduced significantly (P<0.01), whereas there were no remarkable changes of this enzyme activity in their BFU-Es compared with the control group. Both the counts of erythroid progenitor cells and PRPP synthetase activity in CFU-Es returned nearly to normal levels following treatment with SMI of mice in Group 3 (P<0.01). Our results suggest that the attenuation of PRPP synthetase activity in peripheral erythrocytes of AA patients may originate from the weakening of activity of this enzyme in CFU-Es from their bone marrow. The impairment of PRPP formation would explain ATP depletion and disorders of energy metabolism in AA erythrocytes. SMI can distinctly increase the reduced quantity of erythroid progenitor cells and promote rapid restoration of PRPP synthetase activity in CFU-Es of AA mice.
