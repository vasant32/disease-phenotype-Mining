This report describes a method of bleeding control at dental extraction sites using medicaments (thrombin, cocaine, Amicar, Surgicel) in conjunction with a dental appliance containing vinyl polysiloxane silicone putty (Optosil) to provide greater coverage and pressure at the extraction sites. The acrylic splint was used to control bleeding in a 15-year-old male, with an aplastic pancytopenia anemia, who had required removal of severely mobile exfoliating teeth prior to a bone marrow transplantation procedure.
