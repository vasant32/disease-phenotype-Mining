We have shown the possibility to modulate various anemic syndromes during acquired immunodeficiency differed in pathogenesis and induced by graft versus host reaction (GVHR). There are different variants of combined erythro- and immunopoiesis disorders in the semiallogeneic system DBA/2 --> B6D2F1: immunodeficiency plus hemolytic anemia and immunodeficiency plus hemolytic anemia plus immunocomplex glomerulonephritis. In the allogeneic system C57BL/6 --> BALB/c there is immunodeficiency plus hypoplastic anemia with reduced bone marrow erythropoiesis. Differences in pathogenesis of anemic syndrome are connected with the functional properties of macrophages and cytokine production by macrophages. There is some positive effect of chronic hypoxia on GVHR-induced immunopathology in B6D2F1 mice: it increases humoral immune response, has favorable effect on anemia and corrects early and late committed precursor number. The absence of any influence of chronic hypoxia on the secreted activity of macrophages gives an evidence to the direct influence of erythron on the humoral immune response. VM-2-84 has favorable effect on anemia (suppresses IL-1 production, reduces the number of early erythroid precursors and stimulates the amount of the granulocyte and macrophage precursors) in B6D2F1 mice with glomerulonephritis. The compound from alkancarboxylic acids - VM-2-84, up to two months decreases proteinuria and reduces proliferation of mezangiocytes and chronic inflammation with the restoration of immune system. Trecrezan, while having beneficial effect on anemia, reduces a hyperplasia of erythron in mice with immunodeficiency; it influences the production of monokines. The obtained facts about effectiveness of preparation possessing combined erythro- and immunopoiesis-modulating properties, open new ways of a target regulation of disorders of immunity.
