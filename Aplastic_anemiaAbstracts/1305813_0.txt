Bone marrow transplantation has become the accepted treatment for several hematologic disorders. We have done 3 autologous and 6 allogeneic bone marrow transplantations at Ramathibodi Hospital since July 1989 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and severe aplastic anemia. Only one patient with aplastic anemia had late graft rejection, but the rest of them engrafted and did well during the median follow up period of 317 days (range: 39 to 962 days) post transplantation. None of the allogeneic BMT had graft-versus-host disease. We use cyclosporin and short course methotrexate for post transplantation immunosuppression.
