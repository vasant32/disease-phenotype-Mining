OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Yiyuan Shengxue capsule (YYSXC) on peripheral gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Applying the assay of microcell lesion inhibitory and L595 cytotoxicity test to detect gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha level 36 thirty-six cases with CAA before and after treatment with YYSXC. RESULTS: To compare the test group with the normal group, the difference was significant before treatment (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), but after treatment, the difference was insignificant between these two groups (P < 0.05). To compare the group of Kidney Yin Deficiency with Kidney Yang Deficiency, both the difference of before and after treatment were significant. For the therapeutic effective rate, the group of Kidney Yang Deficiency was higher than that of Kidney Yin Deficiency. CONCLUSION: YYSXC could treat CAA through reducing the level of peripheral gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha of CAA patients, and the effect was through regulating the dysfunctional immune state.
