Fulminant puerperal sepsis due to Clostridium perfringens occurred in a primiparous 19-year-old woman who developed aplastic anemia during pregnancy. Although the risk of infectious complications among pregnant women with compromised host defenses has not been accurately determined, it appears to be increased, particularly in patients with granulocytopenia. It therefore seems reasonable to give antibiotic prophylaxis during the intrapartum period to immunosuppressed women who come to term. Consideration of the bacterial pathogens most likely to cause acute endometritis in the early puerperium has led us to recommend a short course (72 hours) of penicillin G, 4 million units q4h, and gentamicin, 1,5 mg/kg q8h, as an appropriate regimen for such patients.
