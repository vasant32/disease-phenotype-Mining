Hepatic tumors unassociated with cirrhosis were encountered in seven patients aged 10 to 19 years. Four patients had received androgens for aplastic anemia. Two patients had transfusional hemosiderosis. One patient had had a renal transplant 2 1/2 years ago. Two patients are alive at 2 3/4 and 2 1/2 years after surgical resections. Nodules were found at autopsy in the others. The tumors were well differentiated and, in the androgen-related cases, differed from the others in the following features: canalicular bile retention, mild nuclear atypia, and acinar formation. No mitoses, vascular invasion, or metastatic tumor were evident. The clinical setting was variable; different factors, including iron overload and androgen therapy, played a role in the development of tumor. Although the androgen-related cases showed mild cellular atypia, biologic evidence of malignancy was lacking as in most previous reports.
