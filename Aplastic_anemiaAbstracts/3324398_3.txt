Over 300 individuals have received fetal liver transplants for a spectrum of disorders including immunodeficiencies, aplastic anemia, leukemia and genetic disorders. In some instances, the objective has been to reconstitute the immune system from fetal liver-derived lymphoid stem cells. In aplastic anemia and leukemia two distinct approaches have been used: engraftment of fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem cells or attempts to stimulate recovery of autologous hematopoiesis via factors produced by fetal liver. In genetic disorders, partial engraftment of fetal liver-derived hematopoietic and hepatic cells has been investigated. This report critically reviews data presented at a symposium on fetal liver transplantation in New-Delhi, 1-5 February 1986.
