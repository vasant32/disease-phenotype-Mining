We evaluated the outcomes of patients with hematologic diseases diagnosed with acute invasive Aspergillus rhinosinusitis comparing a group of patients diagnosed after voriconazole was available at our center with a historical group of patients diagnosed before voriconazole was available. Voriconazole use was associated with a decrease in mortality and earlier clinical response.
