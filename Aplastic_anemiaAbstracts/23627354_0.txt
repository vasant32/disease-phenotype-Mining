 UNLABELLED: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare but extremely serious disorder that results from an unexplained failure of the bone marrow to produce blood cells. Patients with AA are at high risk for infections, including periodontitis. Treatment modalities are complicated by bleeding disorders. This is a case report of the successful periodontal and prosthesis treatment in a patient with AA, chronic diffuse gingivitis, excessive tooth caries that interfered with mastication, painful oral lesions, and limited mouth opening. Physiotherapy was performed to improve the mouth opening, and the patient was examined for HBsAg, HBsAb, and HIV; white blood cell and platelet count and coagulation tests were given before every periodontal treatment. Caries removal and root canal therapy were done, hopeless teeth were extracted, and full-mouth crown lengthening was performed. Free gingival grafts were placed in areas of inadequate keratinized tissue, and full-mouth rehabilitation with fixed prosthesis was completed. RESULTS: The mouth opening was improved to 31 mm, inflammation was significantly controlled especially after comprehensive periodontal treatment, the redness significantly decreased, and an acceptable condition for prosthesis reconstruction was obtained. DISCUSSION: The treatment modalities used in this case provide a new ray of hope for patients who are severely medically compromised.
