 BACKGROUND: The tumor suppressor gene p53 is involved in the control of cell proliferation, particularly in stressed cells. p 53 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic event found in human cancers. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is the most common representative of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) with a leukemic propensity. P 53 DNA alteration has not been studied before in Egyptian children with FA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we investigated p53 mutation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of forty children, FA (n = 10), acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) (n = 10), and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as a control (n = 20), using real-time PCR by TaqMan probe assay. RESULTS: Mutation of p53 gene was demonstrated in the BM of 90% (9/10) of children with FA, compared to 10% (1/10) in AAA (p < 0.001), while, no p53 DNA mutation was seen in the control group. A positive correlation between DNA breakage and presence of p53 mutation was seen in FA (p < 0.02, r0.81). CONCLUSION: mutation of p53 gene in hypoplastic marrow especially FA may represent an early indicator of significant DNA genetic alteration with cancer propensity.
