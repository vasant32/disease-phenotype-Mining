To identify candidate antigens in aplastic anemia (AA), we screened proteins derived from a leukemia cell line with serum of an AA patient and identified diazepam-binding inhibitor-related protein 1 (DRS-1). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed high titers of anti-DRS-1 antibodies (DRS-1 Abs) in 27 (38.0%) of 71 AA patients displaying increased paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells (PNH(+)), 2 (6.3%) of 32 PNH(-) AA patients, 5 (38.5%) of 13 PNH(+) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, and none of 42 PNH(-) MDS patients. DRS-1 gene was abundantly expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines and in CD34(+) cells derived from healthy individuals. Stimulation of T cells from an AA patient displaying high DRS-1 Abs with a putative CD4(+) T-cell epitope (amino acid residues [aa's] 191-204) presented by HLA-DR15, which overlapped with a hot spot (aa's 173-198) of DRS-1 Ab epitopes, gave rise to T cells cytotoxic for L cells (murine fibroblasts) that were transfected with DRB1*1501 and DRS-1. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay demonstrated increased frequency of T-cell precursors specific to the DRS-1 peptide in other HLA-DR15(+) AA patients displaying high DRS-1 Ab titers. These findings indicate that DRS-1 may serve as an autoantigen eliciting immune attack against hematopoietic stem cells in a subset of AA patients characterized by increased PNH-type cells.
