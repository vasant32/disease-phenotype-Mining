The relationship of bone marrow mast cell counts to prognosis was investigated in 48 patients with preleukaemic myelodysplasia, in 59 patients with aplastic anemia and in a DMBA induced myelodysplasia/leukaemia rat model. In patients with myelodysplasia terminating in overt leukaemia the number of mast cells per square millimeter was not correlated to duration of the preleukaemic course. Leukaemia development probabilities of patients at risk were not different for low and elevated mast cell counts. In aplastic anaemia, however, a lower bone marrow mast cell count was related to a higher survival probability and longer survival time. In the animal model no significant differences could be found between myelodysplastic, leukaemic, and control animals.
