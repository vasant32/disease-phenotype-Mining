To investigate the differences of proliferation capacity and phenotype properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow (BM) of aplastic anemia patients, fetuses and children, MSCs were isolated from BM of patients with aplastic anemia and expanded in vitro; MSCs derived from BM of fetuses and children were used as normal control groups, three sources of MSCs were compared by morphology, in vitro proliferation capacity, phenotype and immunocytochemistry. The results showed that MSCs could be isolated and expanded from aplastic anemia patient BM. MSCs derived from BM of aplastic anemia patients shared a similar morphology and phenotype with derived MSCs from BM of fetuses and children. However, in vitro proliferation capacity of MSCs derived from BM of aplastic anemia patients after 20 population doublings (PD) was significantly lower, compared with MSCs from BM of fetuses and children. BM MSCs derived from children and fetuses proliferated for more than 30 PD. It is concluded that BM MSCs from aplastic anemia patients appears to be normal in phenotype but their proliferation capacity is lower in comparison with control groups.
