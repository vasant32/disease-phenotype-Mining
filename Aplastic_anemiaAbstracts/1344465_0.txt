Infection and acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) are the most common complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which compromise this therapeutical method for hematologic diseases. Beside the appreciation of customary preventive measures and the treatment of infections, it is necessary for every bone marrow transplantation center to analyze the development of bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the patients and to generate the most efficient and most rational program for their prevention and treatment. At the Hematology Department in Novi Sad seven allogenic bone marrow transplantations were performed in patients with malignant hematologic diseases and severe form of aplastic anemia. Prevention of the infection by isolation of the patient in a sterile unit, selective decontamination of the digestive tract with sterile food, skin and mucus hygiene and prophylactic drug administration proved rather beneficial and adequate for patients with the graft accepted, hematopoiesis recovered and immunity reconstructed. Risks of infections were increased by permanent vein catheter, acute GVHD and rejection of the bone marrow graft. Prompt isolation and identification of bacteria and fungi, especially in blood, the establishment of a minimal suppressing and bactericide antibiotic concentration, along with the assessment of their synergism, as well as early diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and administration of specific drugs, can significantly contribute to the more successful treatment of infections in transplanted patients.
