A 27 year-old woman had a normal full-term delivery 4 years after bone narrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. She had received combination regimens of systemic high-dose cyclophosphamide and one fraction of total body irradiation for 300cGy as pre-BMT conditioning regimens. This case illustrates that after regimens incorporating total body irradiation and high-dose cyclophosphamide, recovery of ovarian function and normal pregnancy are still possible.
