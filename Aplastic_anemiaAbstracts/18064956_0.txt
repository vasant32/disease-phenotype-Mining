We present a case report of a 6-year-old female child, admitted in the Pediatric Clinic, diagnosed with Aplastic Constitutional Hereditary Anaemia (Fanconi Anaemia). On ophthalmic examination, on the left eye were noted important macular edema and a big preretinal haemorrhage of 4 DP situated on the posterior pole. The treatment of the systemic condition established the involution of the ophthalmic manifestations.
