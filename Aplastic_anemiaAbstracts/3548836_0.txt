Since 1983, twelve patients with severe aplastic anemia and nineteen patients with leukemia were treated with bone marrow transplantation. Six patients with severe aplastic anemia are still alive at 300 to 1,210 days after transplantation, and twelve patients with leukemia are alive at 199 to 671 days. The incidence of GvHD was relatively high (60%). Bacterial infections were the main causes of death.
