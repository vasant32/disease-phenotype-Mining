 BACKGROUND: We report a case of unilateral serous retinal detachment (RD) associated with parvovirus B19 infection. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old woman had a clinical history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia associated with parvovirus B19 infection. She demonstrated focal serous RD without retinal exudates. A focal cataract and anterior vitreous cells were also observed. Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed accumulation of subretinal fluid, but no vascular leakage. After vitrectomy, the retina was re-attached and visual acuity returned to 20/20. IgM antibody to parvovirus and viral DNA were detected by polymerase chain reaction in the vitreous fluid obtained at surgery. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the presence of anti-viral IgM and viral DNA in vitreous sample. Furthermore, the ocular findings in our patient are definitively different from previously reported cases of parvovirus-associated ocular disorders.
