Developments of oral mucosal ulcers induced by herpes simplex virus (HSV) were studied in patients with hematologic malignancy. Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) was identified by immunological staining using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies in the epithelial cells of such ulcers from two patients with malignant lymphoma (ML), three with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), one with refractomy anemia with excess blasts, two with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and one with aplastic anemia (AA). Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) was also identified in an ulcer from a patient with AML. Isolation of HSV-1 was successful in the two patients with ML, one with CML, one with AML, the one with ALL and the one with AA. The ulcers developed on the tongue (four cases), buccal membrane (five cases), hard palate (one case), soft palate (one case), soft palate (one case) and gingiva (two cases). Only one patient with CML and one with AML had accompanying labial vesicular lesions. All patients except the one with AA had previously been given combination chemotherapy with anti-neoplastic agents. The results indicate that HSV may have an important role to play in the development of chemotherapy-related oral mucosal ulcers in patients with hematological malignancy.
