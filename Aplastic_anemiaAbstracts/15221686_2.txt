A case of idiopathic aplastic anemia in a dog was characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow aplasia. Erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) were not detected in bone marrow culture. Addition of the dog's serum to CFU-E culture from control dogs failed to suppress colony formation, suggesting that humorally-mediated suppression at the CFU-E level was not a cause of the aplastic anemia.
