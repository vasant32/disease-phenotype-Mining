Pseudotumor cerebri (PC) is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure with a normal cerebrospinal fluid cell count and protein level in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or apparent obstruction to the cerebrospinal fluid pathway. Although PC is described in patients with various hematological diseases including iron-deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, acquired aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell disease, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, there is no case of PC with Fanconi anemia in the English literature. Here, we report a first case of PC in an 11-year-old boy with a diagnosis of Fanconi anemia.
