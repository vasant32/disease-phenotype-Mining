Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a newly appreciated disease whose hallmarks are local areas of hidebound and puckered skin with peripheral eosinophilia. It looks similar to progressive systemic sclerosis and morphea but often lacks positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and Raynaud's phenomenon. Contractures over joints may develop; several cases of coincident aplastic anemia have been reported. Deep skin biopsy of involved skin reveals lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasionally eosinophils. Unlike scleroderma, EF improves with the administration of corticosteroids.
