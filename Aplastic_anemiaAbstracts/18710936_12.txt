Telomerase adds simple-sequence repeats to chromosome ends to offset the terminal sequence loss inherent in each cycle of genome replication. Inherited mutations in genes encoding subunits of the human telomerase holoenzyme give rise to disease phenotypes including hematopoietic failure and pulmonary fibrosis. Disease-associated variants of the human telomerase RNA are expressed in heterozygous combination with wild-type telomerase RNA. Here, we exploit a sensitized human primary cell assay system to investigate the biological function of disease-linked telomerase RNA variants and their impact on the function of coexpressed wild-type telomerase RNA. We find that telomerase RNA variants discovered in patients with dyskeratosis congenita or aplastic anemia show loss of function without any indication of dominant-negative impact on telomere maintenance by the coexpressed wild-type RNA. To reconcile this result with contradictory findings from reconstitution assays in vitro, we demonstrate that the lack of dominant-negative impact on telomere maintenance correlates with physiological assembly of active human telomerase holoenzyme ribonucleoproteins harboring monomers rather than higher-order multimers of telomerase RNA and telomerase reverse transcriptase. These findings support loss of function of telomerase RNA as a general mechanism of human disease.
