OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of HLA DR2 status of patients with aplastic anemia and their response to immunosuppressive therapy at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Thirty eight consecutive patients of acquired aplastic anemia were evaluated with respect to demographic features, severity of HLA DR2 status and response outcome to immunosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 24.6 years + 16.4 with a male to female ratio of 2.8:1. Positivity of HLA DR2 was markedly high in acquired aplastic anemia patients. Twenty four (65%) out of 38 patients as compared to 45 (15%) of 300 healthy controls (p<0.0001) were positive for HLA DR2. Response to immunosuppressive therapy, which included antilymphocyte globulin, cyclosporin and methylprednisolone, was available in sixteen HLA DR2 positive patients and was found satisfactory in 12/16 (75%) patients. CONCLUSION: HLA DR2 was significantly higher in patients with acquired aplastic anemia and favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy was also associated with HLA DR2 positivity.
