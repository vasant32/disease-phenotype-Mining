A 20-month-old Hispanic male developed severe aplastic anemia after an episode of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Prompt and complete recovery of all hematopoietic cell lines occurred after treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and high-dose corticosteroids. Severe aplasia recurred two months later coincident with a mild upper respiratory infection. A second course of immunosuppressive therapy was followed by complete, sustained improvement. The authors' experience provides clinical evidence indicating that immunologic mechanisms are important in the treatment of severe post-hepatitis aplastic anemia. Children in whom aplastic anemia recurs after immunosuppressive treatment may respond to a second course of therapy.
