In childhood, aplastic anemia is a rare disease of unknown etiology. Besides toxic effects, also an infectious or an autoimmune origin are discussed. We report on an 8-year-old boy with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) who developed pancreatitis together with panniculitis. Initially, active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was thought to be possibly contributive. Ganciclovir was tried resulting in clearance of CMV, but VSAA persisted. Two months after the onset of VSAA, oligosymptomatic pancreatitis was observed together with the onset of severe febrile panniculitis, occurring with multiple painful enlarged subcutaneous infiltrates of up to 7 cm in diameter. Treatment according to the Severe Aplastic Anemia-94 (SAA-94) protocol consisting of glucocorticoids, cyclosporin A (CsA), anti-thymocyte globulin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was instituted. Since this treatment did not lead to remission after day 110, escalation of the CsA dose up to 8 mg/kg body weight was tried. This regimen resulted in complete recovery of panniculitis and symptoms of pancreatitis. Incomplete hematological remission was reached and, to date, the patient has not required transfusions for 6 months. Because this boy suffered simultaneously from three rare disorders, which all responded to intense immunosuppression, this observation may underline common autoimmune mechanisms of these distinct diseases.
