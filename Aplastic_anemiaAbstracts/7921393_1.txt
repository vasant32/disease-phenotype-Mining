BACKGROUND: The use of intensive cytotoxic drug therapy for malignant disorders often results in hepatic dysfunction. It is important to determine the cause of hepatic injury to institute appropriate therapy; however, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may prevent performance of hepatic biopsy to establish a cause. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the cause of hepatic dysfunction using laparoscopic biopsy of the liver in 20 consecutive patients who were receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy, with or without bone marrow transplantation, or who were being treated for severe aplastic anemia. One to three direct-vision laparoscopic biopsies were performed in each patient during general anesthesia and bleeding was controlled with spatula electrocautery. Platelet concentrate transfusions were given before, during, and immediately after the biopsy. RESULTS: Platelet and leukocyte counts at the time of hepatic biopsy ranged from 1,000 to 83,000 per microL (median of 23,500 per microL) and zero to 14,300 per microL (median of 2,200 per microL), respectively. Nineteen of 20 patients had platelet counts of less than 68,000 per microL. Bleeding at biopsy site was controlled during the procedure without evidence of bleeding or complications after biopsy. Biopsy specimens revealed graft-versus-host disease (n = 2), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (n = 1), steatosis (n = 5), cholestasis (n = 19), hemosiderosis (n = 19), and granuloma (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In several patients, the knowledge derived from hepatic biopsy results altered the therapeutic strategy. The use of laparoscopic hepatic biopsy to assess the cause of hepatic dysfunction should be encouraged because it is a safe procedure, even in patients who are severely thrombocytopenic and immunocompromised.
