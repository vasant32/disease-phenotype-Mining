Anomalous cells of the Pelger-Huët type appear mainly in diseases affecting granulopoiesis such as myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis [1]. The association of this anomaly with disorders of the lymphatic system is rare and had been described only in 1 patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [2]. Recently we have encountered another patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired Pelger-Huët anomaly.
