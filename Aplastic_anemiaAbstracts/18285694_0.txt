Over the last 7 years we have seen more than 200 severe aplastic anemia patients at this centre. Three of them developed an unusual complication in the form of thymic hemorrhage. Following this complication, all 3 patients recovered partially from their aplastic anemia, without any need for further immunosuppression. These cases show possible ways to manipulate the thymus gland as a management strategy for this disease.
