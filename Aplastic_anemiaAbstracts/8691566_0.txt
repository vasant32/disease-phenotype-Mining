Ferroerythrokinetic data including erythron transferrin uptake (ETU) calibration of 134 cases of control, hemolytic anemia, hypoplastic anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis (IEP) were subjected to canonical discrimination analysis. Axis rotation was then performed for the second variate so as to be parallel to the long axis of distribution ellipsoid of IEP group. The process yielded three variates. The first one, V-1, was assumed to represent the amount of effective erythropoiesis, the second one, V'-2, its efficiency ratio and the third one, V'-3, the rate of peripheral hemolysis. A definite correlation (r = -0.872) was obtained in IEP group between V'-2 and ETU, i.e. reduction in efficiency and compensatory hyperplasia in erythropoiesis. On the plane with concised parameters of V-1 and V'-2, an ellipse of 95 percent confidence of IEP group and three discrimination lines delineated five areas representing five patterns of ferroerythrokinetics, i.e. IEP, hemolytic, hypoplastic, IEP combined with hemolytic or with hypoplastic ones. This method is considered to be useful for application to those erythropoietic disorders having partial or complicated factors described above, where routine ferroerythrokinetic parameters may, be indecisive.
