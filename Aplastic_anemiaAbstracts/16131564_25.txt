Hematopoietic effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) may be responsible for certain aspects of the pathology seen in bone marrow failure syndromes, including aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and some forms of myelodysplasia (MDS). Overexpression of and hematopoietic inhibition by IFN-gamma has been observed in all of these conditions. In vitro, IFN-gamma exhibits strong inhibitory effects on hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Previously, we have studied the transcriptome of CD34 cells derived from patients with bone marrow failure syndromes and identified characteristic molecular signatures common to some of these conditions. In this report, we have investigated genome-wide expression patterns after exposure of CD34 and bone marrow stroma cells derived from normal bone marrow to IFN-gamma in vitro and have detected profound changes in the transcription profile. Some of these changes were concordant in both stroma and CD34 cells, whereas others were specific to CD34 cells. In general, our results were in agreement with the previously described function of IFN-gamma in CD34 cells involving activation of apoptotic pathways and immune response genes. Comparison between the IFN-gamma transcriptome in normal CD34 cells and changes previously detected in CD34 cells from AA and PNH patients reveals the presence of many similarities that may reflect molecular signature of in vivo IFN-gamma exposure.
