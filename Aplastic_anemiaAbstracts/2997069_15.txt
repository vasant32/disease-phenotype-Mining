Between April 1982 and March 1983, 10 of 26 (38.4%) allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients housed on a newly opened bone marrow transplant unit developed invasive aspergillosis. By contrast, between September 1977 and March 1982, only 3 of 46 (6%) transplant recipients developed invasive aspergillosis. A case-control study to identify host factors related to Aspergillus infection found that aspergillosis was more common in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and aplastic anemia, older patients, patients having cytomegalovirus disease, patients who experienced prolonged granulocytopenia, patients conditioned with ara-C (100-200 mg/day), and patients who received longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. A series of logistic regression analyses revealed that underlying disease was the single best predictor of Aspergillus infection. This study demonstrates that underlying disease is an important risk factor for aspergillosis and that special measures may be warranted when transplanting certain patients.
