 OBJECTIVE: To explore the significance of nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of hematological diseases. METHODS: A nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consisted of CD(3) monoclonal antibody, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine was used for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 33 patients with hematological diseases. Of them, 11 were acute leukemia (AL) in first complete remission (CR(1)), 4 AL-CR(2) approximately 3, 3 refractory AL, 4 severe aplastic anemia (SAA), 7 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, 1 each of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelofibrosis. RESULTS: All 33 patients passed the hematopoietic suppression stage smoothly and achieved engraftment of the donor cells. There were 24 cases of full donor chimerism (13 cases converted from mixed chimerism), 4 mixed chimerism (MC) and 5 developed graft rejection. Of the 33 cases, 7 (21.2%) developed acute GVHD and chronic GVHD, 25 (75.8%) still live and 8 (24.2%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells transplantation is a safe, less toxic and curative approach for patients with hematological disease.
