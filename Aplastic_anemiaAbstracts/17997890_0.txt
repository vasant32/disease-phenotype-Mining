 OBJECTIVE: To assess the reaction of cytokines induced killer (CIK) cells treatment in hematopoietic injury at different levels on patients with benzene poisoning and seek a novel, safe and effective immunotherapy for benzene poisoning. METHODS: CIK cells were in vitro activated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Thirty-two patients with benzene poisoning were treated with CIK cells. Nineteen patients with mild or moderate benzene poisoning in the control group were treated with VitB4, batilol, leucogen, inosine and stanozolol. The results for treatment of 12 patients with aplastic anemia induced by severe benzene poisoning (the efficacy rate and the case fatality rate) were analyzed. The change of T-lymphocyte subset analyzed by flow cytometry was also observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: For mild or moderate benzene poisoning, the increase of WBC and RLT in CIK group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The CD(4)/CD(8) levels were significantly increased after CIK treatment. And for severe benzene poisoning, the effective rate of the CIK group was 91.7% and the mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSION: CIK treatment is safe and effective for hematopoietic injury caused by benzene poisoning. The mechanism may be related with the immune modulation of CIK treatment on immunodeficiency of patients with benzene poisoning.
