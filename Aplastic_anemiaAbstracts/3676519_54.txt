Serum transferrin receptors were measured by a sandwich radioimmunoassay procedure in patients with iron deficiency anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia. The mean circulating transferrin receptor concentration of normal subjects and patients with iron deficiency anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia are 253 +/- 82 ng/mL, 730 +/- 391 ng/mL, 1,426 +/- 1,079 ng/mL, and 182 +/- 39 ng/mL, respectively. The values for those with iron deficiency anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia were significantly higher than that of normal controls and the values for those with aplastic anemia were lower than that of normal controls. After iron supplementation in iron deficiency anemia, the serum transferrin receptor values increased twofold over those of pretreatment values. This increase parallels an increase in peripheral reticulocytes. Therefore, the number of circulating transferrin receptors in anemic patients may reflect the level of bone marrow erythropoiesis and is a potentially useful new index for red cell production.
