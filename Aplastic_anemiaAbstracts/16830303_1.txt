Acute viral hepatitis with hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses in the etiology of fulminant hepatic failure either single or in combinations has been described. Parvovirus B19 is also an etiologic agent of acute liver failure and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. We present a patient diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis A referred for liver transplantation. Parvovirus B19 superinfection was detected when the patient developed anemia during the course of the disease. We discuss possible roles of both viruses in fulminant hepatitis and pure red cell aplasia.
