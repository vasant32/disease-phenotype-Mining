A 43 year old female patient with chronic renal failure originated from polycystic kidney disease was admitted with pancytopenia. Prior to the admission, she had a history of taking allopurinol for 3 months. Allopurinol was discontinued immediately and she was treated with blood transfusion (platelet and RBC) and fluoxymesterone. The lymphocyte stimulation tests were negative for allopurinol and oxipurinol. The determination of serum levels of allopurinol and oxipurinol was disclosed to be not so high compared with other patients treated with allopurinol. On 45th day after admission, she was transfused with bone marrow from her elder brother. Thereafter bone marrow finding of the patient began to improve despite the lack of bone marrow engraftment. For further improvement, pulse treatment with corticosteroid was carried out. Although the pathophysiology of allopurinol-induced aplastic anemia remains unknown, it is interesting to note that bone marrow transfusion and pulse treatment with corticosteroid seemed effective in this case.
