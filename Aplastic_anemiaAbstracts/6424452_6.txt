Because of frequent unavailability of HLA-compatible platelets or their inefficiency in increasing platelet counts in patients requiring platelet transfusions, platelet refractoriness remains a major problem. Since human gamma globulin has been shown to interfere with the binding of platelet-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) to platelets in vitro, and since gamma globulin has proved effective in reversing destruction of platelets in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, we decided to investigate intravenous gamma globulin as an adjunct to random-donor platelet transfusions. We studied three patients, one with acute T-cell leukemia, and two with aplastic anemia. When a total dose of 2 g/kg of body weight of intravenous gamma globulin was infused over five to six days in these patients, two of them showed a remarkable increment in platelet counts and improved hemostasis with random-donor platelet transfusions. We conclude that intravenous gamma globulin may be used in critical situations to improve the response of patients refractory to random-donor platelet transfusions.
