The analysis of the glue "RAZI" was carried out at the Republican Chromatographic Center of Georgia, with high-efficient liquid chromatographic equipment "Millipore Waters" (USA), by I. Wagner's Method. We were able to determine presumable composition of the glue chemical components. The different substances were evaporated at different times fixed by appropriate peaks on chromatogram. There have been at least five toxic substances identified within the glue composition, which are used as industrial or household chemical goods and as some authors explain, may be used as inhaling psychoactive substances. These substances are: benzol (benzene), toluene (toluol), phenol (carbolic acid), chloroform, and methyl-ketone. The glue is inhaled with a small polyethylene bag. The substances are evaporated during inhalation and join arterial blood through lungs. In several minutes leap forward a situation similar to alcohol intoxication. The evaporated substances characterized by strong toxicity and influence to the organism in different ways. The results of chronic glue abuse is serious, such as lethal aplastic anemia, leukemia, marrow damage, chromosome aberrations, functional disorders of CNS, dystrophic changes in myocardium, cirrhosis, liver atrophy and so on. Abuse of the glue "RAZI" can lead to very serious medical consequences and represents emerging public health problem in Georgia.
