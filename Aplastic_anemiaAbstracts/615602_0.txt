We are treating successfully for seven years a nineteenyear-old girl with Fanconi's aplastic anemia combining androgenes and corticosteroids. The cytogenetic analyses of the other family members showed typical chromosome abnormalities in her father, mother and a twelve-year old sister. In the bone marrow of this sister there are already present the first morphological abnormalities, although the values of her peripheral blood counts are still normal. In the present paper we are discussing when to start the specific therapy in the affected sister.
