Ten post-weanling 4-month-old cats, designated "tracers", were placed in a feline leukemia cluster household to determine the efficiency of horizontal transmission of feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The tracer cats were confirmed as negative for prior exposure to FeLV. Following the placement in the leukemia cluster environment, the tracer cats were serologically monitored at intervals of 3-6 weeks for a total period of 1 year. The tests employed included the detection of FeLV using fixed-cell immunofluorescence and the detection and titration of antibody to : (1) the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), as detected by membrane immunofluorescence; (2) viable FeLV, using serum neutralization; (3) virion core protein p30, using radioimmunoprecipitation; and (4) virion glycoprotein gp70, using radioimmunoprecipitation. All of the tracers had evidence of horizontal infection by FeLV, by several criteria. Seven of the 10 had virus that could be isolated from plasma. All of these 7 developed a terminal illness within 18 months; 3 developed aplastic anemia, 3 infectious peritonitis, and 1 lymphoma. The remaining 3 were negative for FeLV by both virus isolation and fixed-cell immunofluorescence. These 3 did, however, develop high antibody titers by all four criteria and they remained healthy throughout the examination period. These results clearly indicate that unprotected pros-weanling cats brought into a leukemia exposure household environment have a high risk of becoming infected with FeLV. Furthermore, a large proportion of the cats are at risk for development of persistent viremia and FeLV-related diseases.
