Bone marrow transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia who are fortunate enough to have allogeneic sibling donors. As patients have been transplanted earlier in the course of their disease, significant improvements have been obtained in long-term survival. However, in patients who have been sensitized by previous blood product transfusions, graft rejection continues to be a significant problem and second transplants when performed are frequently unsuccessful. This case report deals with a patient with myositis ossificans progressiva (MOP) who developed severe idiopathic aplastic anemia. He rejected his first graft after 160 days. However, he was successfully reingrafted with marrow from the same donor using a different conditioning regimen.
