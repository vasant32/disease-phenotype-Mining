 BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether vomiting at presentation of a febrile illness in immunocompromised children with central venous catheters (CVCs) predicts bacteremia. METHODS: A chart review was conducted of children who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of cancer or aplastic anemia, fever, and a CVC. Data were collected on the presence or absence of vomiting, catheter type, presence or absence of severe neutropenia, C-reactive protein (Crp) value, and culture results. RESULTS: There were 143 admissions for fever among 48 children. Among 35 admissions with emesis, 19 included bacteremia; whereas, among 107 admissions without emesis, 19 included bacteremia (P < .001). There was a 5-fold greater risk of bacteremia in children with children without vomiting (odds ratio, 5.50; 95% confidence interval, 2.20-13.67). Gram-negative organisms were more likely to be associated with vomiting than Gram-positive organisms (P = .008). Children with severe neutropenia did not have a significantly higher rate of bacteremia than children who had neutrophil counts >500 cells/mm(3). Other factors that were associated with higher rates of bacteremia were underlying diagnosis and catheter type. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised children with a CVC and a fever who presented with vomiting were more likely to have bacteremia than similar children who presented without vomiting. Gram-negative organisms were more likely to be associated with emesis than Gram-positive organisms. The absence of severe neutropenia was not associated with a decreased likelihood of bacteremia. These findings may be useful in identifying children who are at high risk for bacteremia and in determining initial, empiric therapy.
