The importance of the size of the infused marrow cell dose (MCD) was investigated in 274 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT between 1975 and 1990.  Among those, 65 had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 79 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 58 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 25 severe aplastic anemia (SAA).  MCD was analyzed in bivariate and multivariate analysis together with 6 other clinical factors.  In multivariate analysis a low MCD was significantly associated with increased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in all patients (p = 0.005) and in ALL patients (p = 0.02) whereas in CML a high dose was instead correlated to acute GvHD.  A low MCD was also correlated to an increased incidence of symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (p = 0.001).  A low MCD was also correlated to death in acute GvHD in all patients (p = 0.01) and to a poor survival in all patients (p = 0.04) (AML, p = 0.07).
