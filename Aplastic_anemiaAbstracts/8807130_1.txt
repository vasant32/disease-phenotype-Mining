Massive rhabdomyolysis followed by myocardial necrosis was observed in a 14-year-old patient undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. Rhabdomyolysis was preceded by the administration of cyclophosphamide as part of a preparative regimen for transplantation Although the specific etiology of this rhabdomyolysis is still unknown, an association with high-dose cyclophosphamide should be noted.
