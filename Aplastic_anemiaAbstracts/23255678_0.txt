Present work was carried out to study the prevalence of parvovirus B19 infection in pediatric patients with acquired aplastic anemia. Detection of parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR and IgM antibodies by ELISA was carried out in 66 pediatric patients with acquired aplastic anemia. 45 healthy children acted as controls. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected in significantly higher number of patients in comparison to controls (27% vs 2%, P= 0.001). Similarly, parvovirus B19 IgM antibodies were detected in 17 (25.8%) patients as against one control (2.2%) which again was statistically significant. Clinical and hematological profile of the patients with or without parvovirus infection was comparable.
