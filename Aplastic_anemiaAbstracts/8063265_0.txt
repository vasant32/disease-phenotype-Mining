Recent reports suggest that non-A, non-B, non-C viruses might not be uncommon etiologic agents of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. A 52-year-old woman without previous contact with toxic substances or drugs developed severe aplastic anemia sixteen days after the onset of acute hepatitis. Even after exhaustive serologic testing for hepatotropic viruses and PCR study for hepatitis C virus the etiologic agent could not be demonstrated. Evolution was fatal despite treatment. In this case the time lapse between the onset of hepatitis and the development of aplasia was shorter than in previously referred incidents. This fact supports the hypothesis that different non-A, non-B, non-C agents might be implicated in hepatitis-associated aplasia.
