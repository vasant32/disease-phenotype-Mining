In transfused patients with aplastic anemia, incidence of graft rejection remains significant. Seventeen transfused patients with severe aplastic anemia received BMT from HLA-identical sibling donors after conditioning with cyclophosphamide (CY, 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days) plus total lymphoid irradiation (TLI, 750 cGy in a single dose). For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis one patient received methotrexate, five patients received CsA and 11 received CsA in association with methylprednisolone. All patients had sustained engraftment. The actuarial survival of patients was 76% with a median follow-up for surviving patients of 11 years (range 0.3-14.5 years). The incidence of grade II-III acute GVHD was 24%, and chronic GVHD 35%. Median Karnofsky score of surviving patients is 100 (range 90-100). Only one patient developed interstitial pneumonia. None of the patients has developed a malignancy after BMT. The role of limited field irradiation in development of malignant neoplasms after BMT for aplastic anemia is discussed. We conclude that a conditioning regimen using CY + TLI in sensitized aplastic anemia patients results in a high survival rate on long-term follow-up.
