A 42-year-old man with aplastic anemia presented to hospital toxic and septic secondary to central Silastic catheter sepsis. The chronic indwelling catheter fractured during an attempt at removal and the distal remnant embolized to the right ventricular outflow tract and main pulmonary artery precipitating near cardiopulmonary collapse. The thrombosed catheter was successfully retrieved under fluoroscopy by an endovascular snare technique thus avoiding operative intervention in this immunosuppressed, thrombocytopenic and septic individual. The patient had an uneventful recovery.
