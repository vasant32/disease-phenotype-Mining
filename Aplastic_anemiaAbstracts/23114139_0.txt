This study was aimed to investigate the expression levels of TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with acquired aplastic anemia, and to explore their relation with onset of acquired aplastic anemia. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 40 patients with acquired aplastic anemia and 20 normal subjects as control were collected to detect mRNA expression of TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1 by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the expression levels of TRF1 and RAP1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with acquired aplastic anemia were significantly higher than that in normal controls (P < 0.05), while the expression level of TRF2 was lower than that in normal controls (P < 0.01). There was significant correlation between TRF2 and RAP1 expressions level (r = 0.522, P = 0.001). It is concluded that the changes in expression levels of TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of acquired aplastic anemia.
