Blackfan-Diamond anemia is a congenital hypoplastic anemia with a birth prevalence of about 1 in 200,000, usually presenting in the first few months of life and commonly associated with cardiac, urogenital and digital anomalies. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias are a group of rare congenital anemias characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis. We report on two cases of congenital fetal anemia, one with Blackfan-Diamond anemia and one with dyserythropoietic anemia, presenting with increased nuchal translucency at 12 weeks of gestation.
