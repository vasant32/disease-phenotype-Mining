A 22-year-old female patient with severe aplastic anemia was treated by ATG.bolus methylprednisolone therapy. After the therapy, anemia and thrombocytopenia began to recover within a month. The frequency of blood transfusion decreased thereafter. Since anemia due to splenomegaly was certified, bolus methylprednisolone therapy was performed in good response. Suppressor T-cells towards hemopoiesis were confirmed in this case, and hemopoietic potential was augmented by ATG.bolus methylprednisolone therapy. In spite of discontinuation of any therapy in 1986, she is being in good health more than five years.
