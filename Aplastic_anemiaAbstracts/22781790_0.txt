 OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) high resolution typing mismatching of donor-recipient pairs on prognosis of unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: 835 donor-recipient pairs of CMDP data from 2005 to 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 typing were performed using SBT, SSOP and SSP methods. The diseases involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (\%n\% = 288), aculte lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (\%n\% = 227), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (\%n\% = 187), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (\%n\% = 52), non-hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) (\%n\% = 25), aplastic anemia(AA) (\%n\% = 42) and thalassemia (\%n\% = 14). Of 835 donor-recipient pairs, 362 were completely matched, 159 had a mismatch for a single allele, 125 had a mismatch for a single antigen, 95 had mismatched for both single allele and single antigen, 29 were mismatched at double allele, 20 at double antigen, 45 at multiple allele and antigen. The follow-up assessment was completed before March 2011. RESULTS: HLA-matched pairs had higher overall survival (OS) than HLA-mismatched pairs (79.83% vs 73.15%), but there was no statistically significant differences (\%P\% > 0.05). HLA mismatch for a single allele plus a single antigen was a significantly risk factor for OS, disease free survival (DFS) and transplant-related mortality (TRM). The OS from high to low in different diseases were thalassemia, AA, CML, MDS, AML, NHL, and ALL. OS of HLA locus mismatch were DRB1 (94.4%), DQB1 (83.3%), B (75%), A (74.4%) and C (71.4%), respectively. OS of single allele mismatch at HLA locus from high to low were DRB1, C, A, B and DQB1.HLA-A, B, C locus mismatch were statistically significantly associated with lower OS and grade II-IV acute GVHD compared with HLA-matched pairs (\%P\% < 0.05). The donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*15:01/B*15:05, DRB1*12:01/DRB1*12:02, C*04:01/C*03:04, DQB1*03:02/DQB1*03:03 alleles mismatch were given priority. But the donor-recipient pairs with HLA-B*39:01/B*39:05, C*15:02/C*14:02, C*08:01/C*03:04, C*07:02/C*15:02 alleles mismatch were risk factors for influence of OS and aGVHD. CONCLUSION: The high resolution typing for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 can be identified nonpermissive mismatch, which is beneficial for the selection of a suitable donor improves survival on unrelated donor HSCT.
