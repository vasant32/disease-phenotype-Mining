Clinical histocompatibility testing has now developed to a stage where it is possible to select related bone marrow donors for some patients, when HLA genotypically identical siblings are not available. The most common type of such donors are the HLA phenotypically or HLA-D phenotypically identical related donors. The HLA-D homozygous recipient offers special options, since these patients can potentially receive bone marrow transplants from any of the parents or from HLA-haploidentical siblings. The studies in SCID have demonstrated that HLA-D compatibility in spite of HLA-A or B incompatibilities can be tolerated and there is now accumulating evidence that even patients with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia can be successfully treated with such bone marrow grafts.
