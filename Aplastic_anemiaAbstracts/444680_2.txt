Electron microscopy (thin sections and freeze-fracture replicas) was performed on the bone marrow of ten patients with Polycythemia vera prior to any treatment. In addition to a hyperplasia of all three cell lineages and the sinuses, atypias were observed in the maturing erythroblasts. These aberrations of normal development consisted mainly of deep invaginations of the nuclear envelope in proerythroblasts and conspicuous nuclear clefts in erythro- and normoblasts. In comparison with similar changes in dyserythropoietic and aplastic anemia as well as leukemia these alterations are discussed in connection with disturbances of DNA synthesis. Further atypias involved megakaryopoiesis which displayed microforms probably as an evidence for maturation arrest. These ultrastructural abnormalities and their morphological features of a neoplastic proliferation of all three cell lineages in Polycythemia vera are in good agreement with the new concept of a transformation of a pluripotent stem cell with clonal character.
