Oral administration of chloramphenicol did not significantly alter the early stage of chronic hypoplastic marrow failure induced by busulfan. Chloramphenicol reduction products were most suppressive to antigen-reactive cells detected by the Mishell-Dutton plaque-forming cell assay. This reduction in immunocompetence may be an important parameter in the initial phases of the etiology of chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia.
