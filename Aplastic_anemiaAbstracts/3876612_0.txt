The authors offer a method for cultivating trepanobiopsies in the agar drop-liquid medium system to measure the intramedullary colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in patients with different pathological conditions of the blood system. In patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia and aplastic anemia, the CSA of the whole bone marrow tissue ranges within normal. In patients with recurrent acute myelo- and leukoblastic leukemias, the CSA of trepanobiopsies is lowered. During a remission, in these patients and in those with hemopoietic dysplasia the CSA of the whole bone marrow tissue ranges within normal. There is a positive correlation between the CSA of trepanobiopsies and the number of mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloleukemia and lymphoblastic leukemias and a negative correlation between the CSA and the number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has been thus shown that intramedullary level of the CSA plays a great part in regulation of granulomonocytopoiesis in health and different pathological conditions. It is assumed that stromal elements of the bone marrow may release a factor that is triggered by the colony-stimulating factor or by this factor-synthesizing cells.
