To clarify the prognosis of patients with intractable diseases, a baseline survey of patients who received financial aid for intractable disease treatment between April 1984 and March 1985 was performed in Wakayama Prefecture, followed by a follow-up survey over a period of 8 years. Based on public welfare-subsidized system in Wakayama Prefecture, all patients with intractable diseases were checked up annually their certificates of financial aid for treatment. The results obtained were as follows: Parkinson's disease had the highest rate of discontinuation of medical care at 65%, followed by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) at 64%, aplastic anemia at 55%, ulcerative colitis (UC) at 54%, and Behcet's disease at 50%. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had the lowest rate of discontinuation of medical care at 32%. Discontinuation was due to death in approximately 50% of the patients with SLE, scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, and aplastic anemia. Of these, the causes of death in more than 50% were directly related to the primary diseases. However, in patients with SLE and aplastic anemia, 25% discontinued care because of cure or alleviation. Some patients remained in remission even though the prognosis for these diseases is not generally considered to be favorable. Transfer of jurisdiction to the Disabled Persons Welfare Act was seen in 28% of patients with Parkinson's disease, 24% with Behcet's disease, and 23% with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament, diseases which are believed to cause restriction in daily activities of patients in some cases. On the other hand, cure or alleviation was the reason for discontinuation in 60-70% of patients with Buerger's disease, UC and ITP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
