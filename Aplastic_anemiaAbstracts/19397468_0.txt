Immunocompromised patients are at risk for invasive molds and resistant fungal infections for which amphotericin B may be the only feasible treatment. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) and renal tubular acidosis are known adverse effects of conventional amphotericin B; however, nephrogenic DI has been uncommonly associated with liposomal amphotericin B formulations. We describe an 18-year-old woman with aplastic anemia who developed invasive aspergillosis. She began treatment with high-dose (10 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B at home; however, her condition worsened, and she was hospitalized. Therapy with liposomal amphotericin B was continued until the patient began having symptoms consistent with nephrogenic DI. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of liposomal amphotericin B; however, after rechallenge with lipid complex amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day), the symptoms returned. The patient's nephrogenic DI was successfully treated with diuretics. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score indicated a probable relationship between liposomal amphotericin B and the development of nephrogenic DI. To our knowledge, this is the third report of nephrogenic DI induced by liposomal amphotericin B. This adverse effect is one of many severe adverse effects caused by all formulations of amphotericin B. A clear understanding of these adverse effects is vital for the clinician to successfully weigh the risks and benefits of antifungal therapy.
