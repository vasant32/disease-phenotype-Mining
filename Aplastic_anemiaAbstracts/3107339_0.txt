An autopsy case of hepatitis associated aplastic anemia was presented. A 58-year-old Japanese female with non-A, non-B hepatitis was admitted on August 2, 1983. Moderate grade of fever and hemorrhagic diathesis appeared on September 16, when hepatitis was evaluated as being under resolving. The peripheral blood and bone marrow findings were consistent with aplastic anemia. Since infection was suggested by increased levels of serum gammaglobulin and CRP, treatment with antibiotics as well as prednisolone and blood transfusion was initiated. Since September 21, gradual tenderness and edema on the right lower abdominal wall appeared. She died on October 3. On postmortem examination, systemic plasmacytosis with lymphadenopathy and septic monilial infection was revealed. Numerous plasma cells were atypical, but were immunohistochemically proved to be polyclonal. The bone marrow showed a massive and diffuse plasma cell proliferation with extremely scarce myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. There was a large granulomatous lesion with monilial infection in the wall of the ileocecum. By these findings, systemic plasmacytosis was suspected to be due to chronic monilial infection. The pathogenesis of systemic plasmacytosis in aplastic anemias and in other diseases were discussed with relation to the present case.
