Anti-thoracic duct lymphocyte globulin (ALG) therapy is effective in patients with aplastic anemia. We examined the effect of ALG on human megakaryocyte progenitor cells (colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte, CFU-Meg) in vitro. Normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) were cultured in plasma clots with varying concentrations of ALG or non-immunized horse IgG. After 12 days of culture, significant megakaryocyte colony formation was observed in cultures containing ALG but not in cultures containing non-immunized horse IgG. The peak stimulatory effect seemed to occur with 10-25 micrograms/ml of ALG. When marrow MNC, depleted of adherent and T cells, were cultured in plasma clots with ALG, its stimulatory effect on megakaryocytopoiesis decreased markedly. Finally, it was demonstrated that ALG stimulated marrow MNC to produce a factor stimulatory for CFU-Meg. The in vitro megakaryocytopoietic stimulatory effect of ALG may be related to its clinical efficacy in some patients with aplastic anemia.
