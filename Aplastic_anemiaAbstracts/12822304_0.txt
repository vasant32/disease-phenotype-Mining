The method of immune-enzyme assay was used to examine 113 patients with secondary immunodeficiency, including 16 HIV-infected drug-addicts (group 1), 36 patients with cytomegalovirus infection (CMVI) and with immunoregating index CD4/CD8 below 1.0 (group 2), 30 patients with CMVI and with CD4/CD8 below 1.2 (group 3) and 31 patients with aplastic anemia and with anemia of unclear genesis (group 4), for parvovirus infection caused by parvovirus B19. As for groups 1 and 4, the antibodies were detected in 50 and 48.4% of cases; it is noteworthy that an active parvovirus infection was registered in the above groups more often than in groups 2 and 3. There were patients with the antibodies in group 2 by 1.8 times more than in group 3. It is suggested that the simultaneous impact of HIV, CMV and parvoviruses significantly aggravates the immunodeficiency and contributes to a more severe clinical course.
