Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a complex stem cell disorder and its occurrence in childhood is quite uncommon. A 6-year-old girl with pancytopenia was presented. There is no nocturnal hemoglobinuria or other symptoms of chronic hemolysis. Bone marrow examination revealed mild hypocellularity initially, and a tentative diagnosis of aplastic anemia was made. This patient received conventional therapy with uneventful course. Two consecutive episodes of hemolytic transfusion reaction were noted and positive sugar water test and Ham,s test lead the clue of PNH. The literature on the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of PNH is reviewed briefly.
