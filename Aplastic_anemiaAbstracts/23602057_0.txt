One of the most important morbidity causes of aplastic anemia is invasive fungal infections. It could not be possible to take control of infection without neutrophils despite the recent developments in the antifungals. In this presented case, a patient with severe aplastic anemia, granulocyte transfusion were administered as 46 times because of the presence of widely invasive aspergillosis and resistance. Only fever reaction was observed as a complication of transfusion amongst the other complications such as acute lung damage, alloimmunisation, and graft-versus-host disease. Granulosit transfusions should not be avoided in patients who had an indication for.
