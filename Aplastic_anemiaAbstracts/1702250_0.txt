The paper deals with effects of high-altitude (3200 m) adaptation on the clinical presentation, hemopoiesis, proliferation and differentiation of erythroid bone-marrow cells, growth of cultured bone-marrow fibroblasts, iron metabolism, function of the adrenal cortex and T lymphocytes of aplastic anemia patients. The high-altitude adaptation improves the clinical picture, facilitates hemopoiesis and proliferation and maturation of erythroid bone marrow cells, increases the efficacy of the colony-formation of bone marrow cells, intensifies the glucocorticoid function of the adrenal cortex, and produces positive immunological changes in the organism. Repeated courses of mountain-climatic therapy produce a more stable clinicohematological remission and increase the survival and working capacity of patients. Indications of mountain-climatic therapy are presented.
