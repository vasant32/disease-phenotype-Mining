Two patients with aplastic anemia evolving from cellular bone marrows with severely diminished megakaryocytes are reported. During this evolution a plasma inhibitor of in vitro granulocyte-macrophage colony formation was demonstrated associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis in one patient. The second patient had abnormal liver function that corrected after the delivery of a normal newborn but there was persistence of pancytopenia without evidence of a plasma inhibitor.
