An 83-year-old man with aplastic anemia and steroid induced diabetes mellitus developed multiple nodules with pus on the back of his right hand and forearm. He had been treated with a daily dose of 30mg prednisolone for 2 months. These lesions had appeared a month before his visit. The histopathological findings revealed dermal abscesses containing hyphal structures, lymphocytes, histiocytes and giant cells. Grocott-Methenamine stain demonstrated abundant fungal elements. In culture, colonies grow rapidly and produce a white, cottony mycelium which later becomes gray in color. Microscopically, ovoid and pyriform conidia are produced at the ends of long slender conidiophores. On PCA agar, synnemata with small conidal heads developed at 37 degrees C but cleistothecia did not appear. The patient did not respond to itraconazole therapy, however, with hyperthermic treatment, the eruptions gradually healed. Based on these findings, this fungal infection was diagnosed as pseudallescheriosis.
