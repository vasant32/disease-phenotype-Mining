AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of cyclosporin A (CyA) at different stages of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of CyA was studied in 56 patients with AA. The agent was orally given in an initial dose of 10 mg/kg as solution or capsules. Its daily dose during a treatment course varies with the serum CyA levels and clinical tolerance. CyA was used in 17 patients at the first stage of treatment, in 8 with recurrent AA, and in 31 after ineffective previous therapy (antilymphocytic globulin therapy--ALGT, splenectomy). Erythropoiesis was evaluated by the count of erythrokaryocytes and by relative erythroid hyperplasia of the bone marrow and by using erythrokaryocytic PAS reaction, by calculating the total count of sideroblasts and ringed sideroblasts. RESULTS: A positive response was obtained in 41% of the patients with AA. Its pattern depended on the severity of AA, on CyA use regimens, and treatment duration: when treatment with CyA lasted 6-12 months, its efficacy considerably increased (positive responses in severe AA and mild AA being in 64 and 94%, respectively). It has been found that high (over 6%) baseline bone marrow ringed sideroblasts in patients with AA may be regarded as a poor predictor in the context of the efficacy of this agent. CONCLUSION: CyA is recommended for combined IST in patients with AA at the second stage of treatment (after antilymphocytic globulin administration) in order to perform long-term (12-month) immunosuppression by choosing the optimum dose on an individual basis and by continuously monitoring the quality of a response.
