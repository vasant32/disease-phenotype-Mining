 OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) plus kidney-nourishing Chinese medicinal (KNCM) on severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: Twenty-five subjects of severe aplastic anemia were treated with ATG/ALD plus KNCM between 1992 and 2009, and the clinical data before and after treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 9 were nearly cured, 6 were improved, 5 were in remission, and 5 failed. The overall effective rate was 80.0%. The 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year survival rate were respectively 98.6%, 97.3%, 97.3%, 67.5%, and median survival time was 180 months. Compared to the conditions before administering the medication of ATG/ ALG plus KNCM, after 2 weeks, reticulocyte was first improved (P = 0.001); one month later, followed by palette (P = 0.037); two months later, by neutrophil cell in peripheral blood (P = 0.001); three months later, then by the hemoglobin (P = 0.012). By conducting 1-year follow-up, 1 case of complication--paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) was identified and the patient still alive today. CONCLUSION: ATG/ALG plus KNCM had better effect on SAA and could improve patients' survival rate.
