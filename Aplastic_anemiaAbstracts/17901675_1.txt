Fanconi's anemia is one of the inherited causes of bone marrow failure. It is inherited in autosomal recessive fashion. It presents as aplastic anemia usually at the age of 7-8 yr. Leukemias and solid tumours are complications in those who manage to survive beyond two decades. Though it has been seen in siblings, reports in monozygotic twins have been very few.
