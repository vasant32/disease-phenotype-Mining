 OBJECTIVE: To explore telomerase activity and its association with the proliferative potential of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow (BM) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: Telomerase activity of mononuclear cells separated from BM was determined with the TRAPeze kit. BM specimens from 22 cases with AA and 7 normal controls were included. SPSS10.0 was applied to analyze data derived from telomerase activity and colony-forming unit-granulocyte and monocyte. RESULTS: The median telomerase activity level of BM in AA was 2-fold higher than that in normal controls. There was an inverse correlation in AA between telomerase activity and colony-forming unit (r = 0.78, p < 0.05). BM of chronic AA expressed higher telomerase than that of acute AA. CONCLUSIONS: Telomerase activity in AA was increased and may be the result of the negative feedback of hematopoietic potential. Telomerase activity varied between the subtypes of AA. Telomerase activity was conversely correlated with the proliferative potential of BM in AA.
