In thirty patients with acute leukemia and severe aplastic anemia receiving random single donor platelet transfusions, the development of refractoriness by consecutive platelet transfusions with cytapheresis and its relationship to the appearance of anti-platelet antibodies were investigated. The median number of platelet transfusions inducing refractoriness was 13 times, and 20% of the patients remained unrefractory despite of the repeated multiple platelet transfusions up to 20 to 25 times. The results of anti-platelet antibody tasts by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) and immunofluorescent techniques(IFT) showed no statistically significant relationship with the refractoriness (p greater than 0.1). Although there was significant correlation between the results of ELISA and IFT, both tests were insufficient to find out refractoriness even with the use of pooled platelets from multiple donors as target cells. This study shows that 13 single donor platelet transfusions result in refractoriness, that both ELISA and IFT are insufficient to detect refractoriness despite of their significant correlation, and that other methods than these are needed in order to detect alloimmunization.
