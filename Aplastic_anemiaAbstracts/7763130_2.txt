Phenylbutazone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that was commonly prescribed for the treatment of arthritic conditions; it is no longer available for use in humans because of its numerous side effects, including aplastic anemia. We describe a horse trainer who developed gastric ulcers and renal insufficiency as a result of taking veterinary phenylbutazone. A review of the literature reveals a pattern of abuse by those who work with and around animals. When appropriate, patients who work around animals should be questioned about illicit phenylbutazone consumption.
