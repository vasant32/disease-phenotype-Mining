Forty patients with advanced hematologic malignancies or severe aplastic anemia received marrow grafts from partially mismatched, unrelated marrow donors. All patients were administered conventional prophylaxis for acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) consisting of methotrexate and low-dose glucocorticoids. All but two patients who survived at least 30 days showed durable engraftment. Six patients survive 17+ to 36+ months following transplantation. Severe acute GVHD was seen in 47% of the patients; however, no direct correlation between GVHD and the degree of mismatching could be determined. Fatal infections were seen in 29 patients, and in the majority the infection occurred after the granulocyte count had risen to greater than 500 cells/microL. We conclude that the problems encountered in this pilot study can potentially be solved, and that further studies with this type of marrow grafting are warranted.
