The European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) is collecting information on incidence of bone marrow transplantation in Europe. 203 teams in 26 European countries performed in 1992 a total of 6065 bone marrow transplants (BMT). There were 2666 (44%) allogeneic transplants from 2171 HLA identical sibling donors, 170 non-identical family donors, 29 twin donors and 296 unrelated volunteer donors. There were 3399 autologous transplants (56%): 2494 autologous BMT, 644 autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants and 261 combined autologous bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Transplant indications were leukemias in 2963 patients (49%) (1987 allogeneic, 976 autologous), lymphoproliferative disorders in 1890 patients (31%) (201 allogeneic, 1689 autologous), solid tumors in 739 patients (12%) (10 allogeneic, 739 autologous), aplastic anemia in 194 patients (3%) (193 allogeneic, 1 autologous), thalassemia in 128 patients (2%) (all allogeneic), inborn errors in 115 patients (2%) (all allogeneic) and miscellaneous disorders in 36 patients (32 allogeneic, 4 autologous). Main differences were observed in the number of transplanting teams, and in the number of allogeneic and autologous transplants performed in the different European countries compared to the number of inhabitants.
