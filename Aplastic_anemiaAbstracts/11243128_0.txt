OBJECTIVE: To explore more effective regimen for chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Forty-five cases of CAA were treated with triolandren (TLD) (15 cases) or TLD and cyclosporin A (CsA) (30 cases). RESULTS: The response rate of TLD-CsA group (83.3%) was higher than that of TLD group (60.0%), furthermore, the recovery of bone marrow colony-forming cell (CFC) number of the responding patients was more complete and rapid in TLD-CsA group than in TLD group. Bone marrow CFC number had no significant change of all nonresponding patients in both groups. CONCLUSION: The response rate of TLD-CsA was higher than that of TLD alone, and the recovery of bone marrow CFC number of the responding patients was more complete and rapid in TLD-CsA group.
