The intravenous human gamma-globulin (SM-4300) was used with antibiotics for 9 patients who had severe bacterial infections resisted to the antibiotics. All of these patients had underlying hematological diseases, acute leukemia, aplastic anemia, malignant lymphoma and pure red cell aplasia. In many of the cases the leukocyte counts were extremely decreased. In 11 episodes of the infections, 4 cases were successfully treated by SM-4300 and 4 cases were not. No adverse reaction was found. It seems that the use of SM-4300 is effective for the treatment of these severe infections.
