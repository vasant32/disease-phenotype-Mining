An original method is suggested for assessment of the profile of specific weight of peripheral blood red cell pool cells based on fractionation of washed red cells in verograffin discrete density gradients with due consideration for osmotic reactivity of verograffin solutions. Fifty-five donors and 90 patients with various anemic syndromes (iron-deficiency anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, autoimmune hemolytic, B12-deficiency, and hypoplastic anemias, acute leukemia) were examined. Analysis of peripheral red cell pool helped specify the disease severity, monitor the adequacy of therapy, verify a remission, and predict the process recurrences. Moreover, study of red cell pool fraction composition permits assessment of the individual normal level of red cells and Hb in human blood, which is significant when making a person's "health passport".
