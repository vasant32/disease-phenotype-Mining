AIM: To examine the pattern of changes in the count of peripheral granulocytes in children with aplastic anemias (AA), receiving a combined immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocytic globulin (ATG) and cyclosporin A in combination with granulocytic colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 31 children (17 boys and 14 girls) aged 2-15 years (median 9 years) with newly diagnosed severe and very severe acquired AA took a combined immunosuppressive therapy with ATG and cyclosporin A in combination with G-CSF in an initial dose of 10 micrograms/kg a day. RESULTS: A three-linear and response was recorded in 19 (61%) children, an isolated granulocytic response was in 26 (84%). The interval median before the recovery of granulocytes to 1.5 x 10(9)/l and 5 x 10(9)/l was 19 and 38 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of G-CSF may increase the count of granulocytes in the vast majority of patients with AA, without dramatic influence on the frequency of a three-linear response. Intermittent use of G-CSF may maintain the count of granulocytes long at the safe level and reduce the cost of treatment.
