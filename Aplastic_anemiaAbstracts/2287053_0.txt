The efficacy and safety of a combination regimen using cefmetazole (CMZ) and netilmicin (NTL) were evaluated in the treatment of infections complicated with hematological disorders. Primary diseases in 31 patients included in the evaluation were acute myelocytic leukemia (3 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (2 cases), malignant lymphoma (14 cases), chronic myelocytic leukemia (2 cases), chronic myelocytic leukemia blast crisis (4 cases), myelodysplastic syndrome (2 cases), aplastic anemia (3 cases), and malignant histiocytosis (1 case). Complicated infections included 29 cases of suspected septicemia, 1 case of septicemia and 1 case of pneumonia. Clinical responses were excellent in 6 (19.4%), good in 12 (38.7%), fair in 1 (3.2%) and poor in 12 (38.7%). The total clinical efficacy rate was 58.1%. No significant effect of initial neutrophil counts was observed on response rates. Patients who showed increasing neutrophil counts during therapy had higher response rates than those in whom the neutrophil count decreased or remained unchanged at levels less than 500/mm3 in after neutrophil counts. No side effects were observed in any of the 31 patients. In conclusion, this combination therapy of CMZ and NTL thus appears to be useful and safe in therapies for infections complicated with hematological disorders.
