The growth of mononuclear human peripheral blood cells from five patients with aplastic anemia (AA) was tested in diffusion chambers over a period of 13 days. Considerable differences were seen in the total cell number compared with controls. The total cell number of three patients with AA was markedly lower than in the control group (eight controls). The differentiation of the cells showed considerable differences in the growth patterns of the lymphocytes and in granulopoiesis; in three of five patients with AA no granulopoiesis was observed.
