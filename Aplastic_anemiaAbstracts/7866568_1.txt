A case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with preceding aplastic anemia is reported. The patient was a 36 year old female who had been diagnosed as having aplastic anemia 10 years before and thereafter had received multiple transfusions. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositivity was revealed 10 months prior to her death, but no particular clinical signs indicating HIV infection, pre-AIDS or onset of AIDS were recognized before serological diagnosis, although the slow progression of leukopenia was noted along with thrombocytopenia. Her general condition deteriorated during the last 10 months accompanied by an acute decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio. Autopsy revealed full-blown AIDS: systemic aspergillosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Epstein-Barr virus-related B cell lymphoma arising in the diaphragm and severe lymphocyte depletion in the lymph nodes and spleen. Markedly hypoplastic bone marrow was considered to be primarily attributable to the aplastic anemia but the affection of AIDS was not excluded. The possible transmission route of HIV and the effect of the preceding aplastic anemia on the infection and clinical course of AIDS are discussed.
