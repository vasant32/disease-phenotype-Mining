23 patients with severe aplastic anemia have been treated. 10 marrow grafts between HLA matched siblings were performed after conditioning with cyclophosphamide. 5 are still alive at over 7 months to over 2 1/2 years after grafting. 3 are hemopoietic chimeras and 2 show autologous marrow reconstitution. 13 patients were treated by ALG with or without transfusion of allogeneic marrow. 9 are still alive with partial to complete autologous hemopoietic reconstitution at over 1 month to over 4 years. It is concluded that in many instances aplastic anemia is an autoimmune disease rather than a primary failure of the hemopoietic stem cells. In acute leukemia allogeneic marrow grafts still pose enormous problems and only one of our 12 grafts has become a longterm survivor.
