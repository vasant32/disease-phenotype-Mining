Aplastic anaemia is a haematological syndrome in which pancytopenia is due to a depletion, damage of inhibition of hemopoietic stem cells. The pathogenetic factors are still unclear: damage or inhibition of hemopoietic stem cells may be direct or indirect mediated through changes in the cellular humoral environment; evidence is accumulating that in some cases these processes are of autoimmune nature. The prognostic evaluation is based on hematological parameters at diagnosis: severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is defined by the following criteria: neutrophils less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l; reticulocytes less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l and platelets less than 20 X 10(9)/l. Survival rates in children with SAA are poor; the probability of survival at 1 year from diagnosis being 10%. In this form treatment is based on supportive therapy (transfusion and prevention of infections) and on a specific therapy: immunosuppression and/or BMT. BMT is reserved to patient with an HLA identical sibling donor and may be curative in 70-80% of cases. To date the use of antilymphocytoglobulin in SAA has also given satisfactory results with a favorable response in 50-60% of cases.
