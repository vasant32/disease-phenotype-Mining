A 10-year-old girl with Fanconi anemia and severe aplastic anemia underwent a haploidentical BMT from her mother due to lack of a matched family donor. T cell depletion was done by positive selection of CD34 cells with immunomagnetic beads. Due to graft rejection a second haploidentical BMT from the father was successfully undertaken. No immunosuppression was given after the transplant. Immunological reconstitution took approximately 6 months, with no GVHD or severe infections. Such a transplant, containing a large purified CD34 cell fraction with a minimal number of added T cells, should be considered as the treatment of choice for patients with Fanconi anemia if no HLA matched donor is available.
