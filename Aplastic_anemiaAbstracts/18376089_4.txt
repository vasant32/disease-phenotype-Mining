 OBJECTIVE: To assess the responses to ATG and cyclosporin combination in patients of aplastic anemia. METHODS: Twenty three (17M: 6F) patients of aplastic anemia (11 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) and 12 severe aplastic anemia (SAA), were administered antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin. RESULTS: The median age of patents was 8 years (range 6-12 years). Three patients died within 2 months of therapy. Twenty children (11 SAA and 9 VSAA) were finally analysed. Six months after the start of treatment, 8/20 (40%) patients responded-2 complete (CR) and 6 partial responses (PR). At the end of 1 year; 2 patients maintained CR and seven patients continued PR (overall responders 45%). The response was better in SAA (54.5%) with 2 CR and 4 PR; than in VSAA (33%) with 3 PR . Eleven (55%) children were alive without response. One patient developed AML 13 months later. CONCLUSION: We conclude that antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin combination is an effective treatment for aplastic anemia patients who are ineligible for bone marrow transplantation.
