A nationwide cooperative incidence survey of aplastic anemia (A.A.) was carried out by the Institute of Hematology, CAMS, from 1986 to 1988. The cooperative survey network covered 44 investigating areas, involving 21 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. More than 52 million person-years were supervised and 387 new cases identified. The annual incidence rate was 0.74/10(5) and the 95% confidence interval of population rate ranged from 0.67/10(5) to 0.82/10(5). The incidence rate of A.A. in coal mines was higher than that in general areas. The incidence rate of chronic aplastic anemia (CA.A.) was 0.60/10(5) and that of acute aplastic anemia (A.A.A.) was 0.14/10(5). There were high peaks of CA.A. incidence rate at old age. The peak of CA.A. in females was at age 50-59, but the peak in males was after 60. The incidence rate of CA.A. in males decreased obviously at age 40-49 and that in females rose clearly at age 10-19. The incidence rate of CA.A. in males was generally higher than that in females.
