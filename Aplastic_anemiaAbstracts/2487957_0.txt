Three patients, a 28 years old female (case 1), and two males aged 32 and 18 (cases 2 and 3) received allogeneic bone marrow transplants for acute non lymphatic leukemia (cases 1 and 2) and severe aplastic anemia (case 3) from HLA identical siblings. All patients were conditioned with Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, and received GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporin and steroids. Disease free survival is greater than 232, greater than 50 and greater than 201 days. Hematological reconstitution was detected 12, 13 and 10 days post transplant. All patients presented fever during the first month and received broad spectrum antibiotics including amphotericin in case 3. Acute GVHD presented in case 3 and chronic GVDH in case 1. Both patients responded to higher doses of cyclosporine and steroids. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is a complex and expensive therapy, but can benefit a selected group of patients who fare poorly with conventional therapy. This report communicates the first three successful allogeneic bone marrow transplants performed in Chile.
