Three patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, thalassemia major and aplastic anemia experienced hemorrhagic cystitis on the 23rd, 35th and 36th day respectively after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The conditioning regimens before transplantation comprised cyclophosphamide with or without busulfan and total lymphoid irradiation. The hematuria lasted from 5 to 45 days and then subsided after treatment. Multiple factors including the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, viral infection and graft-versus-host reactions may contribute to late onset hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Adequate treatment to minimize urothelial damage from chemotherapy, screening for viral infection and controlling graft-versus-host disease are mandatory in decreasing the complication of late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis after bone marrow transplantation.
