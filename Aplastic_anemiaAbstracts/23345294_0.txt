We report the first case of Neosartorya laciniosa invasive sinusitis involving the orbit in an immunocompromised male with aplastic anemia. Treatment included surgical debridement with enucleation of the eye and combination voriconazole and micafungin therapy followed by voriconazole alone. The fungus was identified using sequencing of partial benA and calmodulin genes.
