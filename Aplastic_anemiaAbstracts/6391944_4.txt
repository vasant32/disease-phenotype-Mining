The pulmonary function of patients receiving marrow transplants was studied during a two-year period. The 81 patients studied before transplantation showed a slight reduction in average lung volumes and diffusing capacity (DLCO). Studies were repeated within 48 h after marrow infusion to look for evidence of fat embolism syndrome. There was no change in the DLCO, but there was a 4% decrease in the lung volumes. Sixty-three patients (20 with aplastic anemia, 43 with hematologic malignancies) completed studies on admission and every other week during hospitalization (mean of six studies per patient). When categorized by diagnosis or conditioning regimen (including with and without total body irradiation), no differences were seen. The patients developing interstitial pneumonitis (IP) had restrictive ventilatory changes and decreases in the DLCO. The patients not developing IP remained unchanged. The patients developing IP averaged a 20% decrease in the DLCO before the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, but a decrease in the DLCO lacked specificity for predicting occurrence of IP. Among 18 patients developing graft-versus-host disease, there was no evidence of air-flow obstruction. We conclude that patients developing IP have restrictive ventilatory changes, but in the absence of complicating IP, the marrow transplant regimen (including marrow infusion and total body irradiation) leaves pulmonary function largely unchanged.
