According to recent reports, cyclosporin (CsA) has been proven to be a cure for some patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The use of CsA to treat SAA is based on both experimental and clinical evidences showing that this disease is sometimes caused by immune-mediated mechanisms. This report describes a fourteen-year-old boy who recovered from SAA after being treated with CsA, together with to a lesser extent prednisolone. In June of 1986, when he failed to improve after receiving six months of corticosteroid treatment, CsA was introduced. Following three weeks of CsA therapy no further blood transfusion was needed. Danazol was added on the 28th day of CsA therapy. On the 105th day the blood counts began to improve, and on the 375th day bone marrow aspirate revealed normal hematopoiesis. Along with these improvements, however, some side effects from the CsA treatment were observed. These included: hirsutism, hypertension and gingival hyperplasia, all of which eventually subsided on tapering and finally terminating CsA. For the time being, no side effects have been observed in the six-months period since CsA was stopped and the patient is leading a normal life.
