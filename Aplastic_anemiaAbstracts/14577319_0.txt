An adult patient suffering from G-CSF-resistant very severe aplastic anemia received a cord blood transplantation from a three-loci HLA-mismatched unrelated donor after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Cord blood was infused after conditioning with fludarabine (180 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg). Cyclosporin A and short-term methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute GVHD. Engraftment was achieved on day 23, and there was no serious GVHD. A full-donor type T-cell chimerism was obtained by day 30. Normal hematopoiesis and complete chimerism have been maintained 14 months after transplantation.
