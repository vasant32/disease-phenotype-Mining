Two patients with hematologic disease, one of whom had received androgenic steroids, had liver damage associated with peliosis hepatis. In one patient with spherocytic hemolytic anemia, peliosis hepatis was an incidental postmortem finding. In the other patient, who was treated with androgenic-anabolic steroids for aplastic anemia, hepatic failure associated with peliosis hepatis developed. Splenic involvement by peliosis was present in both patients. Peliosis hepatis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatic disease in patients with hematologic disorders, especially if treatment has included androgenic-anabolic steroids.
