Chronic exposure of humans to benzene has been shown to have a cytotoxic effect on hematopoietic progenitor cells in intermediate stages of differentiation, which can lead to aplastic anemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. We studied the effect of hydroquinone (HQ), a toxic metabolite of benzene found in the bone marrow, on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60), which can be induced to differentiate to both monocyte and myeloid cells, and thus has been used as a surrogate for a granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cell. Exposure of HL-60 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of HQ for 3 hours before induction with phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the acquisition of characteristics of monocytic differentiation, such as adherence, nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity, and phagocytosis, but had no effect on cell proliferation. HQ appeared to be affecting maturation beyond the monoblast/promonocyte stages. HQ also prevented differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]; however, the block occurred after the acquisition of adherence. HQ at concentrations that inhibited monocytic differentiation had no effect on differentiation to granulocytes, suggesting that the block in the differentiation of these bipotential cells is a step unique to the monocytic pathway. HQ was unable to prevent differentiation induced by the macrophage-derived cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1, a differentiation factor for cells of the monocytic lineage.
