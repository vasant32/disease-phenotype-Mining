Five patients with aplastic anemia were treated with cyclosporine A. In four cases a positive response was noted. In three out of these patients frequency of blood transfusions was decreased. Platelet count increased to 50 x 10(9)/L in two cases and in one case agranulocytosis disappeared. Synergistic effect of cyclosporine A with oxymetholone and prednisone was seen. In one case an improvement lasted only for 1 year. Hepatotoxicity being a complication of therapy was noted in one patient.
