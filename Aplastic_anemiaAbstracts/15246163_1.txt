 OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow from aplastic anemia (AA) patients shows reduced numbers in long-term culture (LTC)-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays. The LTC-IC assay is based on assumptions of the culture kinetics of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are not necessarily justified in a disease state. We therefore undertook a detailed examination of the kinetics of quiescent HSC from AA patients in LTC. METHODS: Colony formation by quiescent HSC in LTC was tested by pretreating control (n=6) and AA bone marrow (n=7) with 5-fluorouracil. Secondly, we manipulated normal samples to inoculate cultures with proportions of CD34+ cells similar to those from AA samples. We obtained enough CD34+ cells to reconstitute one AA sample to "normal" levels. RESULTS: Patient cells showed altered kinetics with rapid proliferation and premature termination of LTC. In vivo, decreased numbers of HSC may induce rapid proliferation and differentiation; a similar phenomenon could explain the observations in culture. We therefore manipulated normal samples to contain a proportion of CD34+ HSC similar to that in AA samples. Although absolute numbers of secondary colonies in LTC were reduced, the kinetics of culture were not altered. However, when AA CD34+ HSC were reconstituted to "normal" levels, the cultures still demonstrated early termination. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of LTC are not affected by CD34+ HSC number. However, quiescent HSC derived from patients with AA have qualitative differences from normal cells, as reflected by distinct kinetics in long-term culture. This has implications for the interpretation of the LTC-IC assay with AA samples.
