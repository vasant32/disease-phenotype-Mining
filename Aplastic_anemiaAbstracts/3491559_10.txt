We administered antithymocyte globulin to a 52-year-old man with cutaneous sclerosis (scleroderma) and severe aplastic anemia for treatment of the aplastic lesion. The use of this therapy resulted not only in marrow recovery but also in resolution of the sclerosis. This observation indicates that T lymphocytes, their products, or both, are important factors in the pathogenesis of cutaneous sclerosis. Furthermore, the success of this treatment could play a role in future investigations involving the treatment of scleroderma and scleroderma-like conditions.
