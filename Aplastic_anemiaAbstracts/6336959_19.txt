Cyclosporin-A (CsA) was given to 22 patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplants as therapy for aplastic anemia and hematologic malignancies. The drug was given daily for 180 days starting with the day of marrow infusion. Engraftment was not impaired and myelotoxicity was not observed. Cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in five patients and all either spontaneously resolved or promptly responded to therapy with steroids. Five patients developed systemic GVHD and all responded to therapy with steroids, but only two survived. Interstitial pneumonia was seen in six patients and was fatal in all of them. Liver function abnormalities were seen in 14 patients but could not positively be correlated with CsA administration. Renal function abnormalities were seen in 17 patients. Amphotericin-B therapy contributed significantly to the renal failure. Serum levels of CsA, measured by radioimmunoassay, could not be correlated with the presence of liver or renal function abnormalities. Overall survival so far has been 50.0%. Second malignancies were not observed, but one patient relapsed with leukemia at 343 days.
