The aim of this study was to investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) +874 T/A correlates with aplastic anemia. Amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the polymorphism gene segment of IFN-gamma +874 A/T from 54 aplastic anemia patients and 51 healthy adults. The results showed that the frequency of IFN-gamma +874 TT genotype and T allele was significantly higher in patients with aplastic anemia than that in the healthy adults (42.6% vs 17.6%, chi2=13.780, p=0.01; 65.7% vs 39.2%; chi2=14.811, p<0.001). In conclusion, IFN-gamma +874 A/T gene polymorphism is correlated with the susceptibility of aplastic anemia, but not significantly correlated with the the severity of aplastic anemia.
