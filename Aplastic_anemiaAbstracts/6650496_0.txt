A patient is presented who developed aplastic anemia 3 months after exposure to intravenous chloramphenicol. She died of this disease 4 years later. Other cases of marrow aplasia due to parenteral chloramphenicol are reviewed, in order to emphasize that this complication, although rare, is not restricted to the use of oral chloramphenicol.
