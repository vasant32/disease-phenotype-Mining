Three children with refractory severe aplastic anemia were transfused with high numbers of unrelated matched (n = 2) or C-locus haploidentical mismatched (n = 1) CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cells in the absence of an HLA-identical family donor. Two leukaphereses of the donors yielded a median number of 10.1 x 10(10) nucleated cells (range 9.7-15.4) with a median number of 9.89 x 10(8) CD34+ cells (range 7.46-26.1) and a median percentage of CD34+cells of 0.98% (range 0.77-1.7). After positive selection by magnetic cell sorting the patients received a median of 14.3 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 11.7-24.3) and of 1.3 x 10(4) CD3+ cells/kg (range 0.57-5.8). Median time to ANC >/=0.5 x 10(9)/l was 7 days (range 7-12) and to platelets >/=20 x 10(9)/l 13 days (range 13-27). Chimerism analysis of peripheral blood after transplantation revealed permanent 100% donor hematopoiesis in all patients. The patient with the C-locus haploidentical mismatch presented with acute GVHD (grade III-IV) of the skin, liver and lower gastrointestinal tract (onset day +40) and died despite intensive immunosuppressive treatment on day +238. The two survivors developed lymphopoietic recovery of B and T lymphocytes within 3 months after transplantation. To our knowledge this experience represents the first report of transplantation with unrelated CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cell in children with refractory severe aplastic anemia.
