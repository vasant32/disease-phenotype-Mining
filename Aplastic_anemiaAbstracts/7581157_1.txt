The immunosuppressant cyclosporine induces acute hemolysis (hemolytic uremic syndrome) in some patients after transplantation, possibly because of its effects on the vascular endothelium. We report a case of Coombs-negative, non-immune severe hemolytic anemia during cyclosporine therapy after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. Uremia was not observed. Vitamin E was effective in treating the intravascular hemolysis.
