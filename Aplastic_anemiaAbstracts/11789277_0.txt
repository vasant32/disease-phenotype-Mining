OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of Shengxue mixture (SXM) in treating aplastic anemia, and studied its mechanism. METHODS: Eighty-four patients of the treated group, those with Spleen-Kidney Yang deficiency Syndrome and Spleen-Kidney Yin deficiency Syndrome were treated with SXM-A and SXM-B respectively, and 30 patients of the control group were treated with Stanozolol. The clinical effect and several experimental parameters were also observed. RESULTS: The basic cure rate, remission rate, total effective rate of the treated and control group were 21.43%, 27.38%, 86.90% and 3.33%, 20.00%, 56.67% respectively, the difference between 2 groups was significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The effect of the treated group was obviously better than that of the control group. While the patients' symptoms were alleviated, the peripheral blood cells increased, the ratio of T lymphocyte subsets tended to balance, the level of natural killer cells activity increased, interleukin 2 reduced, and the reproduction of the bone marrow were markedly improved in most of the patients treated by SXM. CONCLUSION: SXM is an effective and safe drug for aplastic anemia. Its mechanism might be regulating the immune function, which facilitated the recovery of the bone marrow hematopoiesis function.
