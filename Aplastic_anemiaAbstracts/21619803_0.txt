 OBJECTIVE: To explore the bone marrow feature of hemopoietic system injured by benzene through analyzing 56 benzolism cases. METHODS: The 56 benzolism cases were divided into mild poisoning group, midrange poisoning group, aplastic anemia group, pancytopenia group and leukemia group. All cases progressed bone marrow aspiration and smear, and counted hundred karyocytes by Wright-Giemsa tinct bone marrow smear to classification and observe the cells' feature. RESULTS: The megakaryocytes and the extent of bone marrow hyperplasia were decreased by turns of mild poisoning group, midrange poisoning group and aplastic anemia group. The archaeocytes and juvenile cells proliferation in mild poisoning group and midrange poisoning group were inhibited and occurred cell paramorphia which related to intoxication. Comparing with the other groups and normal reference value, the pancytopenia group's percentage of bone marrow cells in karyocytes was significantly decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and the leukemia group's percentage of bone marrow cells in karyocytes was significantly increased (P < 0.01). The proportion of cell paramorphia and nucleus malformation of granulocytes and red blood cells in pancytopenia group and leukemia group were increased, especially in leukemia group. CONCLUSION: We saw the inhibition of archaeocytes and juvenile cells proliferation and some cell paramorphia appearances in mild poisoning and midrange poisoning cases of chronic benzolism. The abnormality changes which can be seen in bone marrow of severe benzolism cases were corresponding with the clinical classification.
