A retrospective study of acquired aplastic anemia in 100 Thai children treated with testosterone and prednisolone during 1969 to 1987 is reported. The age ranged from 3-14.5 years (mean 10.3 years). The male to female ratio was 2.3:1. The duration of follow up ranged from 1-17 year (mean 5 years). Prior exposure to possible etiologic agents was found in 36% : antipyretics, Ya-chood, insecticides, benzene, chloramphenicol and paint. The presenting symptoms were bleeding and anemia 72%, fever with either bleeding or anemia 28%. The common sites of bleeding were purpura, epistaxis, gum and teeth, and the gastrointestinal tract. All patients received appropriate supportive treatment and testosterone combined with prednisolone. The results of treatment were evaluated in 80 cases who were followed up until death or at least one year after the diagnosis. Two-thirds of the patients presented with laboratory findings similar to severe aplastic anemia; the fatality rate was 50% (40/80). Most of them succumbed to infection or bleeding in the first 6 months after diagnosis. The recovery rate was 50% with complete, partial and initial responses in 28%, 17% and 5% respectively. The late malignancy rate was 2%. For severe aplastic anemia or for patients who have poor prognostic factors, early approaches of bone marrow transplantation or antilymphocyte globulin administration should be considered.
