The retrospective study presented here reports clinical, electrophysiological and CT-data from 21 patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation for leukemia or aplastic anemia between 1980 and 1985. The aim of the investigation, which was performed at the end of 1986, was to elucidate whether antineoplastic drugs and radiation can result in long-term damage of the central nervous system. In 9 patients we observed neurological signs (1 leukencephalopathy, 5 cerebellar symptoms). Seven patients revealed dysrhythmia in the EEG and five had delayed latencies of visual evoked potentials. Eight patients exhibited pathological changes in CT (3 atrophy of supratentorial structures, 3 periventricular lucencies, 2 a combination of both). The results indicate that long-term damage to the CNS may be encountered after successful bone marrow transplantation.
