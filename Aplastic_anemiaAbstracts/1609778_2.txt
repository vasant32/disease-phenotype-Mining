Aplastic anemia includes a group of disorders characterized by peripheral blood pancytopenia and marrow hypocellularity. The current report describes a patient who is an apparent constitutional mosaic and presented with marrow aplasia. Using cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow, skin, and peripheral T lymphocytes, we demonstrated the clonal nature of this patient's aplastic marrow, and, in addition, identify clonal evolution. The patient was treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and achieved a complete remission, with disappearance of an abnormal evolved clone. This case illustrates that clonal cytogenetic abnormalities do not preclude a response to ATG and that aplastic anemia may be a nonmalignant clonal disorder with clonal evolution.
