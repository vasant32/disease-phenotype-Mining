Severe aplastic anemia is the most serious complication of chrysotherapy. No treatment for this condition has been demonstrated effective. We report 3 patients with gold induced severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin. Complete marrow recovery was obtained in 1 case and a partial but satisfactory response in the other. All the patients remain alive without requiring blood transfusion after followup of longer than 16 months.
