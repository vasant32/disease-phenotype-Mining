Transplantation of hematopoetic stem cells is established therapy today. It includes transplants from bone marrow, peripheral blood or cord blood. Leukemias, lymphoproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia and congenital disorders of the bone marrow are main indications for allogeneic, lymphoproliferative disorders, leukemias, solid tumors and severe autoimmune disorders main indications for autologous transplants. New developments, such as reduced intensity conditioning approaches and selective donor lymphocyte infusions open the procedure to older patients and to those with coexisting other morbidities. Whenever possible, the transplant is integrated into the treatment plan from diagnosis. The individual risk profile determines choice of procedure and time point. Diagnosis and age as sole criteria no longer suffice. Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation might serve in the future as a model for stem cell transplants for other organs.
