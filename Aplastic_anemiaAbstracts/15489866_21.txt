Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used in severe aplastic anemia (SAA) as a part of the conditioning regimen. Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found to be more effective in preventing GVHD and rejection of organ transplants. As the fludarabine-based conditioning regimens without total body irradiation have been reported to be promising for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from alternative donors in SAA, thymoglobulin was added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide conditioning to reduce GVHD and to allow good engraftment in unrelated BMT. Five patients underwent BMT with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -9, -8, -7 and -6), fludarabine (30 mg/m2 once daily i.v. on days -5, -4, -3 and -2) and thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -3, -2 and -1) from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Complete donor type hematologic recovery was achieved in all patients. No serious complication occurred during BMT. Only one patient developed grade I acute GVHD resolved spontaneously. Except for one who had rupture of hepatic adenoma 78 days after BMT, all the other four patients are still alive with median 566 days. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning allows for the promising results of good engraftment, tolerable toxicity and minimal GVHD.
