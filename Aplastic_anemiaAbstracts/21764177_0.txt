Radiologic feature of primary nasopharyngeal lymphoma is a predominantly homogenous, nonnecrotic large tumor with no or minimal deep tissue invasion. To the best knowledge, nasopharyngeal lymphoma has not been presented with hemorrhagic necrosis. Thus, we report 2 cases of nasopharyngeal lymphoma with hemorrhagic necrosis mimicking an abscess. The patients had bleeding diathesis such as aplastic anemia or idiopathic portal hypertension.
