This report summarizes the results of unrelated cord blood transplants. Sixty-five patients were reported to Eurocord. One year survival was 29%. Factors associated with survival were diagnosis, inborn errors had a better survival than leukemia or aplastic anemia; higher number of cells infused and negative pre-transplant CMV serology were also favorable factors. Granulocyte and platelet engraftment were associated with a higher number of nucleated cells infused, GVH incidence was low especially in CMV negative patients, it was not associated with the degree of HLA disparity. These results were similar to other series reported in the USA and showed the benefit of using mismatched unrelated cord blood in clearly defined situations.
