Fresh fetal liver obtained from 3- to 6-month fetus was prepared. Fetal liver cell suspension (FLC) or fetal liver cell-free suspension (FLCF) were then transfused into two groups of patient of aplastic anemia. 15 of 21 patients of aplastic anemia treated with FLC showed reconstitution of haemopoietic function or improvement of peripheral blood pictures, while 27 of 30 patients treated with FLCF showed reconstitution or improvement. It is verified that there is a stimulating factor for CFU-CM, BFU-E, and CFU-E and also a immunologic stimulant for improving the nonspecific immunologic function of the organism as shown by clinical analysis and experimental study. It is obvious that the therapeutic effect of FLCF is much better than that of the FLC.
