We measured reticulated platelets (RPs) and plasma glycocalicin (GC) and thrombopoietin (TPO) levels simultaneously in 107 thrombocytopenic patients to clarify the diagnostic value of these tests for discriminating hyperdestructive from hypoplastic thrombocytopenia. The percentage of RPs and GC index (plasma GC level normalized for the individual platelet count) were markedly elevated in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) but normal or slightly elevated in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (ChemoT). For RP percentage for diagnosing hyperdestructive thrombocytopenia the sensitivity and specificity were excellent but were lower for the GC index. Absolute RP counts and plasma GC levels were markedly decreased and plasma TPO levels markedly elevated in patients with AA or ChemoT, but absolute RP counts and plasma GC levels were moderately decreased and plasma TPO levels only slightly elevated in patients with ITP. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma TPO levels for diagnosing hypoplastic thrombocytopenia were excellent. Using the RP percentage and plasma TPO levels in combination improved specificities. Simultaneous measurement of RP percentage and plasma TPO level may help discriminate thrombocytopenia of unknown cause in routine hematologic practice.
