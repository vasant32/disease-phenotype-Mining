OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Fas/FasL system in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA) and its correlation with clinical status. METHODS: Plasma levels of sFas and sFasL and the expression of Fas antigen on mononuclear cell (MNC) membrane in 32 AA patients and 24 normal controls were assayed by ELISA and FACS, respectively. RESULTS: The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in AA patients than that in normal controls, and the percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells in severe AA patients was much higher than that in chronic AA patients (P < 0.05). The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was negatively correlated with the course of disease. The levels of sFas were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in AA patients than that in normal controls, and the sFas levels in severe AA were much lower than those in chronic AA (P < 0.05). The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was negatively correlated with sFas level. CONCLUSION: Fas/FasL system aberration is involved in the pathogenesis of AA.
