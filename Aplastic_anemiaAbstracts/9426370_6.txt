Trichothecenes are mycotoxins produced by various species of fungi which can occur on various agricultural products. Among these compounds, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON) are the most naturally encountered and potent trichothecenes. Consumption of trichothecene contaminated foods by farm animals and humans leads to mycotoxicoses. Trichothecenes are known to induce haematologic disorders such as neutropenia, thrombopenia, and aplastic anemia in human and animals. The aim of our investigations is to explore the effects of trichothecenes on the haematopoietic progenitors. The four trichothecenes previously demonstrated to be strongly cytotoxic for human CFU-GM have been tested on human BFU-E. For this purpose, a culture model of human erythroblastic progenitors (BFU-E) optimized for toxicological studies was used to determine the effects of T-2, HT-2, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON) on red blood cell precursor proliferation and differentiation. Results showed that human BFU-E are as sensitive to trichothecenes as human CFU-GM, except for DON, in the range of concentrations tested. Differentiation of erythroblastic progenitors could be perturbed by these mycotoxins. Human erythroblastic progenitors are also a target of trichothecenes.
