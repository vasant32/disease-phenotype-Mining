A 22-year-old female was admitted on June 19, 1993 with pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia was diagnosed and she was treated with anti-thymocyte globulin. After one month, she started to feel abdominal pain. Her platelet count was 1.3 x 10(4)/microliters at that time. Computed tomography revealed vast accumulation of blood in the abdomen and pelvis. A total of 1,000 ml blood was obtained from the right ovarium and she underwent right partial oophorectomy. Although ovarian bleeding is rarely reported in aplastic anemia, we should always keep in mind this possibility when abdominal pain occurs in a female patient.
