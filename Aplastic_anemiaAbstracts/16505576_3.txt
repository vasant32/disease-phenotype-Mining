An eight year old boy presented with severe anemia and bleeding spots. Complete blood count showed pancytopenia. There was mild reticulocytosis. Bone marrow was hypocellular with normoblastic erythroid hyperplasia. Ham's test (acidified serum test) was positive which confirmed the diagnosis of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Although PNH is rare in childhood, it should be considered as a diagnostic possibility in cases of aplastic anemia as the two conditions can coexist. The presence of PNH in association with aplastic anemia can influence the outcome of the latter.
