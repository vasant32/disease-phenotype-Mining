A 10-year-old girl with aplastic anemia received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Three years after an uneventful course apart from chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) she presented with chronic hypoxemia, reduced diffusion capacity of the lungs, normal spirometric lung function and increased bilirubin and liver enzymes. Intrapulmonary vascular dilatations were demonstrated. Pulmonary complications after BMT may include a hepatopulmonary syndrome (liver disease, hypoxemia, intrapulmonary vascular dilatations).
