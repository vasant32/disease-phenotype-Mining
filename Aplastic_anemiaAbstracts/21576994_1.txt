 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the success rate and effects on survival of different anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) preparations in patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Of the total 24 patients included in the study, 12 were male and 12 female with a median age of 44 years (range 16-72). Nine patients received Lymphoglobulin®, 7 Thymoglobulin® and ATG-Fresenius® (ATG-F). There was no significant difference between the three treatment groups in terms of severity of aplastic anemia. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month survival rates for ATG-F, Lymphoglobulin and Thymoglobulin groups were 42.9, 77.8 and 71.4%, respectively. The difference in overall survival rates between groups was not significant, most likely due to the low number of patients. The most striking result was that none of the patients in the ATG-F preparation group showed any response to treatment. The ATG-F group was found to have a significantly inferior response rate (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Our data showed that none of the patients responded to ATG-F treatment. Hence, despite the small number of the patients, we recommend that ATG-F should not be used for treatment of severe aplastic anemia.
