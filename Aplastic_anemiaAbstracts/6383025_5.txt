Seventeen patients who developed aplastic anemia in association with viral hepatitis were transplanted with sibling marrow. Of the 16 HLA-identical recipients, 14 were conditioned with cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg, and two received 10 Gy total body irradiation. One HLA-nonidentical recipient received 123 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 10 Gy total body irradiation. Of the 14 patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone, one died on day 49 after graft rejection, and 13 had sustained engraftment. Six of the 13 developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which led to death from opportunistic infections 84, 97, and 130 days after transplantation in three patients. Four of the 13 developed chronic GVHD, two without preceding acute GVHD. Currently, ten of the 14 cyclophosphamide-conditioned patients are alive 0.9-12.4 (median 5.9) years from transplantation. The two HLA-identical recipients conditioned for grafting with total body irradiation died after failure of engraftment, and one also developed concomitant hepatic venocclusive disease. The mismatched recipient conditioned with radiation and cyclophosphamide died of severe GVHD 18 days posttransplant. We conclude that survival, graft rejection, and incidence of acute and chronic GVHD after marrow transplantation for hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia are similar to those of patients transplanted for aplastic anemia of other etiologies. Previous hepatic damage from viral hepatitis and liver function abnormalities existing at the time of grafting do not appear to increase the risk of posttransplant morbidity and mortality from hepatocellular damage or venocclusive disease in cyclophosphamide-conditioned patients.
