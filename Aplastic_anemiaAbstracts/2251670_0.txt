Analysis of the clinical efficacy and long-term survival of patients with grave and not grave forms of aplastic anemia, subjected to splenectomy or treated with antilymphocytic globulin has shown that in grave aplastic anemia, the clinical efficacy of antilymphocytic globulin is higher than the efficacy of the operative treatment methods. The 30-month survival can be attained in 42% of the patients given globulin and in 28% of the patients after splenectomy. In patients with grave aplastic anemia, it is recommended that the treatment be instituted from the use of antilymphocytic globulin in a dose of 15 mg/kg bw daily for 5 days, provided there are no contraindications. In patients with not grave aplastic anemia, the results of splenectomy and therapy with antilymphocytic globulin are approximately the same: the 5-year survival amounts to 94 and 93%, respectively. Therefore, the use of globulin may be recommended as a method of choice for the above patients' group, since surgical approaches to the treatment are still coupled with a high risk for the patient's life.
