Unusual pulmonary uptake of 111In-chloride (111InCl3) was recognized in a patient with aplastic anemia. A chest radiograph showed infiltrative shadow concordant with 111InCl3 uptake, and autopsy revealed pulmonary aspergillosis. To our knowledge, there is not an extensive literature on 111InCl3 uptake in pulmonary aspergillosis.
