Abnormalities of lymphocyte subpopulations have been described in patients with aplastic anemia. In the present report we extend these studies by measuring T cell subsets identified by the presence of Fc receptors for IgM (T mu-lymphocyte) and IgG (T gamma-lymphocyte) in 22 patients and in 48 normal controls. The absolute number of T mu and T gamma lymphocytes was normal in the majority of cases. The percentages of T mu cells was increased in 4 cases and decreased in 2; T gamma cells were increased in 6 patients. The levels of serum immunoglobulins did not correlate with the T mu/T gamma ratio. The pathogenesis of aplastic anemia is discussed in terms of these immunological abnormalities.
