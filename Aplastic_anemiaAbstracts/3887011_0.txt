Eight patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and two patients with congenital hypoplastic anemia (CHA) were treated with absorbed samples of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) at a total dose of 50-75 mg/kg body weight intravenously over 5 days. Duration of the disease was 1-14 years. Median age of the ten patients was 11 (4-15) years. Four of the eight patients with SAA were responders and transfusion independent for a follow up of 11 to 50 months. In two cases thrombocytopenia of about 100 000/mm3 is present. Four patients were non-responders three of them died in the meantime by the underlining disease. Two patients with CHA did not respond to ATG treatment. The CFU-C level of all eight patients with SAA before treatment was severely decreased. In co-culture studies with normal bone marrow no growth inhibition of normal bone marrow could be demonstrated. Also 20% patients serum did not inhibit normal bone marrow growth. The results are compared with data from literature and discussed in respect to alternative therapies.
