Rejection after allogeneic BMT for aplastic anemia is a complication with a high risk of mortality. We describe a patient who, following a second episode of rejection after a second BMT entered a third durable remission subsequent to treatment with ALG, donor lymphocyte infusions, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin. Therapy was well tolerated. At 5 years after rejection treatment, his hematopoiesis is of complete donor origin as determined by analyses of short tandem repeats. Thus, donor lymphocyte infusions can be considered as a therapy option for marrow rejection after allogeneic BMT for aplastic anemia.
