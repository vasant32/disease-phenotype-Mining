Peliosis hepatis is a rare pathological entity and may cause fatal hepatic hemorrhage and liver failure. Here, we present a young male patient with aplastic anemia, who had received long-term treatment with oxymetholone. The patient suffered from sudden onset of intra-abdominal hemorrhage with profuse hemoperitoneum. The patient was treated successfully with a right hemihepatectomy and is in good health after 13 postoperative months. We suggest that peliosis hepatis be considered in patients with hepatic parenchymal hematoma, especially in patients under prolonged synthetic anabolic steroid medication. The possibility of a potentially life-threatening complication of massive intra-abdominal bleeding should also be considered.
