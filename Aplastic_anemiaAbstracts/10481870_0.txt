AIM: To validate up-to-date policy of immunosuppressive therapy of patients with aplastic anemia (AA) which has developed either at acute or chronic phase of viral hepatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 16 patients with AA detected within 6 months (9 patients) or 12-36 months (7 patients) after acute viral hepatitis received immunosuppressive therapy (antilymphocytic globulin, cyclosporin A, splenectomy). RESULTS: Posthepatitis aplastic anemias ran a severe and treatment-resistant course in most cases. The immunosuppressive therapy produced a response in 44% of the patients. AA following acute viral hepatitis demands intensive and long-term immunosuppressive therapy with antilymphocytic globulin, cyclosporin A, splenectomy (in some cases) to achieve a persistent clinicohematological remission.
