We investigated the efficacy of an antithymocyte globulin/cyclophosphamide preparative regimen prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical siblings in patients with severe aplastic anemia. Since 1990, 21 patients, 6 males and 15 females, with a median age of 25 years (range: 7-43) have been enrolled in the protocol consisting of 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 90-120 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin (ATG, rabbit, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). For further graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis all patients received cyclosporin A and a short course of methotrexate (MTX). Only one patient had a primary graft failure (5%). All other patients engrafted with a leukocyte count >1.0 x 10(9)/l and a platelet count >20 x 10(9)/l after a median of 19 (range: 11-28) and 26 days (range: 13-67), respectively. No late graft failure or relapse was observed. Two patients experienced mild acute GVHD grade I (10%), and one patient developed grade II GVHD (5%). No severe grade III/IV GVHD was observed; 17% of the patients developed limited chronic GVHD. The treatment-related mortality was 14% and mainly due to fungal infection. After a median follow-up of 70 months (range: 2-139), the estimated overall and event-free survival at 10 years for all patients is 86% (95% confidence interval: 70-100%). We conclude that ATG plus cyclophosphamide is an effective conditioning regimen in patients with aplastic anemia undergoing stem cell transplantation with a low treatment-related mortality, resulting in an excellent outcome.
