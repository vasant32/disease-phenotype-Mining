 OBJECTIVE: To analyse the proportion of hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) in severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and its clinical features of HAAA. METHODS: All newly diagnosed SAA cases in our department in the recent 5 years were analyzed. A case-control study was undertaken to investigate the differences of clinical and laboratory features between HAAA and non-hepatitis associated SAA (non-HASAA) patients. RESULTS: The proportion of HAAA in SAA was 3.3%. There was no significant difference in PB cell counts, bone marrow hematopoiesis status and the amount of blood transfusion between HAAA and non-HASAA patients. Sera from 13 patients with HAAA were tested for antibodies to hepatitis viruses A, B, and C and hepatitis B surface antigen. Twelve (92.3%) of them had negative serologic results for the tests and only one (7.7%) had a positive result for HBsAg and HBeAg. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were decreased prior to the diagnosis in twelve (92.3%) of the 13 HAAA patients. The percentage of CD4(+) cells in HAAA patients was significantly lower than that in non-HASAA patients (P < 0.05). HAAA patients had higher percentages of CD8(+) cells (P < 0.05) and lower ratios of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (P < 0.05). The early infection rate of the HAAA patients was significantly higher than that of non-HASAA patients (84.6% vs 42.3%, P < 0.05), with different mortalities (61.5% vs 15.4%, P < 0.05). The 2-year survival rate of HAAA patients was significantly lower than that of non-HASAA patients (16.6% vs 83.2%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The proportion of HAAA in SAA was 3.3%. Most of HAAA were associated with non-A, non-B and non-C hepatitis virus. Compared with that of non-HASAA, the abnormality of T cell immunity of HAAA was more severe, with a higher frequency of early infection and a higher mortality rate.
