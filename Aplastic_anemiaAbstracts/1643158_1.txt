The management of aplastic anemia continues to challenge clinical investigators. With bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppression the prognosis of the patient with aplastic anemia has improved remarkably. For patients who are not eligible for bone marrow transplantation, antilymphocyte globulin has become the standard treatment. There is growing evidence that some patients also respond to immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. Further data suggest that combination of cyclosporin A with antilymphocyte globulin or androgens might be beneficial. An international workshop summarized the data on cyclosporin A treatment in aplastic anemia and attempted to create guidelines for the use of cyclosporin A in the management of aplastic anemia.
