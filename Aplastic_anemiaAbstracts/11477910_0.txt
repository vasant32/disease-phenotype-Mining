OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and side effect of prepared Rehmannia polysaccharide (PRP) associated with stanozolol in treating chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Thirty-four cases of CAA were treated by PRP liquid associated with stanozolol, course of 3 week treatment, and control group (17 cases of CAA) was treated by stanozolol alone. RESULTS: Effective rate was 85.3% in treatment group, and that of control group was 58.8%, there was significant difference between them (P < 0.05). Symptom remission of treatment group was earlier than that of control group, symptom scoring between two groups, the difference was highly significant (P < 0.01). Blood cell had a distinct elevation after treatment with PRP associated with stanozolol, and had a significant difference in comparing with pre-treatment in treatment group (P < 0.01). Side effect of PRP was not found during treatment of CAA. CONCLUSIONS: PRP associated with stanozolol to treat CAA has an additional effect, it can accelerate symptom remission without any additional side effect.
