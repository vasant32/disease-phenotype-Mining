Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is one of the most effective procedures to cure the previously uncured hematologic diseases. However, it is costly and HLA typing to select the compatible donors contributed to its cost. A total of 53 prospective patients for BMT and their 114 siblings were analyzed to evaluate the use of locally prepared HLA-ABC common typing tray (ABCCT) during Mar 1988-Mar 1992. The 16, 9, 7, 5, 5 and 12 patients were diagnosed as aplastic anemia, CML, thalassemia, ALL, ANLL and other blood diseases, respectively. It was found that 18 patients were HLA-identical (HLA-ID) with one of their siblings except one patient had 2 HLA-ID sibs. All of those who appeared to be HLA-ID were further tested for the HLA-ABCDR typings. It was observed that 16 (88.89%) of 18 patients and 17 (89.47%) of 19 sibs were confirmed as HLA-ID. After careful clinical screening, only 13 HLA-ID pairs were able to proceed to the mixed lymphocyte culture and confirmed their status of HLA-ID by this test. Finally, only 6 (46.15%) of 13 patients received BMT with a high rate of success, ie all patients have survived with bone marrow engraftment. Thus, ABCCT is very useful for related BMT. It was highly efficient to exclude HLA-non-ID and haplo-ID yet the cost and workload were greatly reduced.
