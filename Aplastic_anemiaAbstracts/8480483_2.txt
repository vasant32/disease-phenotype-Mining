A 24-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of thrombocytopenia during her second pregnancy. During the second trimester of her first pregnancy, the patient developed aplastic anemia which resolved completely following termination of pregnancy. Three and a half years later she was admitted in the third trimester of pregnancy suffering from severe thrombocytopenia and hypoplastic bone marrow which improved after a normal delivery. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of recurrent bone marrow hypoplasia associated with pregnancy.
