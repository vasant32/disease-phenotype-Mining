We report a patient who developed aplastic anemia after three courses of cyclohexylchloroethylnitrousurea (CCNU), procarbazine and oncovine administered after craniotomy and irradiation for brain astrocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, aplastic anemia following CCNU has not been reported previously. The unique course of the disease and implications of this complication are discussed.
