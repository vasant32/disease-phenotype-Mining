 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of fuzheng yangying oral solution on bone marrow proliferation and serum interleukin 2 in immune-induced aplastic anemia mice. METHODS: The immune-induced aplastic anemia mouse models were built up, and then were divided into 4 groups by randomized allocation. The models were fed with physical salts (Group A, n = 10 ), fuzheng yangying oral solution (Group B, n = 10), cyclosporin A (Group C, n = 10), and fuzheng yangying oral solution plus cyclosporin A (Group D, n =10), respectively. Another 10 healthy mice served as controls (Group E). The changes in blood cells, bone marrow karyocyte count, marrow hematopoietic tissue capacity, and serum interleukin 2 level were observed. RESULTS: The blood cells, bone marrow karyocyte count, and marrow hematopoietic tissue capacity in Group A were significantly lower than those of Group E (P < 0. 05) ; those in the 3 treated groups (Group B, C, and D) were significantly higher than those of Group A ( P < 0. 05 ); and Group D was the highest ( P < 0. 05 ). There were no significant difference between Group B and C ( P > 0. 05 ). The level of interleukin 2 in Group A was obviously higher than that of Group E (P < 0. 05 ); The levels of interleukin 2 in the 3 treated group ( Group B, C, and D) were significantly lower than those of Group A ( P < 0. 05 ); and Group D was the lowest ( P < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in the level of interleukin 2 between Group B and C ( P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Fuzeng yangying oral solution can impove the bone marrow proliferation and reduce the level of serum interleukin 2 in immune-induced aplastic anemia mice.
