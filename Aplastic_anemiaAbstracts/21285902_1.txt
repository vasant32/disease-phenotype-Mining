A 10-year-old boy with acquired, very severe aplastic anemia developed acute lung injury after the administration of equine antithymocyte globulin, during conditioning for allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Limited cases of antithymocyte globulin-induced acute lung injury have been described in adults. The respiratory worsening was sudden and required mechanical ventilation. The clinical course was complicated by sepsis with Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Implications for treatment are discussed and earlier literature is reviewed.
