A few weeks after treatment with INH, RFP and SM, severe aplastic anemia developed in a 49-year-old man with pulmonary atypical mycobacteriosis due to M. kansasii. All drugs were discontinued immediately after bone marrow examination revealed severely hypoplastic marrow, but pancytopenia continued for several months. Although M. kansasii was sensitive to other drugs including CS and TH, these two drugs were also discontinued because of their respective psychiatric and hepatic adverse effects. Ofloxacin (OFLX), to which M. kansasii was sensitive, was administered without clinical improvement and complete resistance to OFLX developed after several months treatment. Right upper and middle lobectomy and S6 partial lobectomy was performed, and postoperative sparfloxacin (SPFX) administration resulted in cure of the disease. Drug sensitivity testing revealed that the organism had acquired resistance to OFLX, but was still sensitive to SPFX. Thus, SPFX appears to be an useful drug for the treatment of atypical mycobacteriosis.
