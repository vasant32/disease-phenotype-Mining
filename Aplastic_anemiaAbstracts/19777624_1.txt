6-Mercaptopurine given during pregnancy to a patient suffering from acute monocytic leukemia (histiocytic or Schilling's type) permitted the birth of a premature but otherwise normal infant. The drug was given from the sixth to the eighth week and from the twenty-eighth to the thirty-first week of pregnancy, in doses sufficient to cause two remissions and two episodes of hypoplastic anemia.
