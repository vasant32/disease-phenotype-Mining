Serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in 46 patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia. The concentrations of serum EPO in aplastic anemia were shown to correlate inversely both with hemoglobin concentration and % bone marrow hematopoietic tissue. Serial determination of EPO levels showed a progressive decline in proportion to improvement of anemia. The results suggest that serial determination of serum EPO is useful in monitoring the hematopoiesis of aplastic anemia.
