Two pediatric patients with severe aplastic anemia, elevated antiplatelet antibody levels, refractoriness to human lymphocyte antigen-matched platelet transfusions, and sustained bleeding problems were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), pH 4.25, for three to over nine months. Improved responses to platelet infusions and improved hemostasis were demonstrated in both patients. A review of the published literature analyzing the role of IVIG in the treatment of platelet alloimmunization is presented.
