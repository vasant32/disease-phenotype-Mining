 BACKGROUND: Previous studies specifically focused on the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) of children with moderate aplastic anemia (MAA) are rare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantage of using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in the IST and its outcome of children with MAA. METHODS: Forty-two children diagnosed with moderate aplastic anemia from 1993 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Eighteen patients treated with ATG, cyclosporin A (CSA), and androgen are defined as the ATG group, the other 24 patients treated with CSA and androgen are defined as the non-ATG group. Survival and hematological response of the two groups were studied. RESULTS: Response rate and transfusion-independent survival of the ATG group were both significantly higher than those of the non-ATG group (83.33 vs. 41.7%, p = .006; and 83.33 vs. 50%, p = .043, respectively). Compared with non-ATG group, fewer patients in ATG group progress to severe aplastic anemia (p = .03). CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive therapy including ATG benefits children with moderate aplastic anemia.
