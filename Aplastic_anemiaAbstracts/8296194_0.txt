Since October 1988 there has been an isolation ward at Basle Cantonal Hospital. Its purpose is to treat patients with high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation under protective isolation and by standardized criteria. The isolation ward has two sub-units, viz. the reverse isolation for neutropenic patients (8 single room units) and the LAF unit (5 laminar airflow units) for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Up to July 1992, 287 patients (152 males and 133 females) required 527 hospitalizations. The median age was 41 (5-82) years in the reverse isolation unit and 28 (4-61) years in the LAF unit. Bed occupation was 90% and 82% throughout the period. 71% of patients were from the Basle area and the rest from elsewhere in Switzerland or from other countries. Diagnosis: acute leukemias (112); myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes (52); severe aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis (46); lymphoproliferative syndromes (50); solid tumors (28). Indications for hospitalisation: BMT (107); complications after BMT (infections, GvHD) (63); chemotherapy on protocols of SAKK (105); other chemotherapies (64); antilymphocyte globulin or growth factor treatment (27); splenectomies (18); neutropenic fever (62); patient work-up (59); terminal care (20). Patients in reverse isolation were hospitalized for a median 17 (1-142) days; in the LAF unit for 52 (1-121) days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
