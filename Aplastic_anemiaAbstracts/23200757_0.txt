Th1/Th17/Th2-related chemokines (CXCL10/CCL20/CCL2) and their receptors (CXCR3/CCR6/CCR2) have rarely been studied in acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFs). We evaluated the concentrations of CXCL10, CCL20 and CCL2 in plasma and BM fluid from aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine mRNA expressions of those chemokines and their receptors. CCL20 levels in both plasma and BM fluid from AA, PNH and MDS patients were significantly higher than those in the corresponding samples from healthy controls; there were no differences in terms of CXCL10 and CCL2 levels. Significantly higher expressions of CXCR3 and CCL20 mRNA, meanwhile significantly lower expression of CCR2 mRNA in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and bone marrow MNCs (BMMNCs) from AA and PNH patients were observed, with no differences in terms of CXCL10, CCL2 and CCR6 mRNA expressions. CCR6 mRNA expressions in both PBMNCs and BMMNCs from MDS patients were significantly higher than of the corresponding samples from controls. Our study implicated that CXCL10-CXCR3, CCL20-CCR6 and CCL2-CCR2 interaction might play important roles in Th1 and Th17 (but not for Th2) cells trafficking toward BM in acquired bone marrow failure syndromes.
