Older age is a limitation for HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as first-line therapy for severe acquired idiopathic aplastic anemia (SAA). Fludarabine (Flu)-based conditioning might improve outcome in older patients. We analyzed retrospectively 30 patients older than 30 years receiving such reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT according to recommendations of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and compared their outcome to a control group receiving the standard regimen (cyclophosphamide+/-antithymocyte globulin) over the same study period (1998-2007). Patients conditioned with Flu had a higher probability of overall survival than the control group (p=0.04) when adjusting for recipient's age. This might be related to a trend towards a reduced incidence of graft failure in patients receiving Flu (0% vs. 11%, p=0.09), while no difference was observed regarding graft-versus-host disease incidence. Flu-based conditioning regimen may reduce the negative impact of age in older patients with SAA receiving an HLA-identical sibling HSCT.
