The objective of this study was to analyse human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and disease association in common blood diseases [chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), thalassemia and severe aplastic anemia] in Thais. The subjects were patients from the Hematological Clinic, Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital who were referred for HLA typing for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Histocompatibility Laboratory from March 1988 to September 1997. A total of 129 patients had complete HLA-ABC typing. The patients included 45 CML, 40 ANLL, 26 thalassemia (Thal) and 18 severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Of these, 88 patients were typed for HLA class II. The HLA class I (ABC) and II (DR, DQ) typings were performed by microlymphocytotoxicity test. It was found that HLA class I was associated with CML, ANLL and Thal, whereas, HLA class II was associated with SAA. HLA-B8 and HLA-B18 were increased in CML with R.R. values of 12.2 and 3.9, respectively, whereas, HLA-B18 was increased in ANLL with R.R. value of 4.5. In addition, HLA-DR2 and DR3 were increased in SAA with R.R. values of 3.8 and 4.8, respectively. For Thal, HLA-A2 and B46 were increased in Thal in Central Thais with R.R. values of 3.3 and 6.1, respectively, whereas, HLA-B13 was increased in Thal in Northern Thais with R.R. value of 8.5. On the other hand, HLA-B7 was absent in CML. HLA-Cw7 was decreased in CML and SAA, whereas, HLA-DR6 was decreased in ANLL and SAA. Furthermore, HLA-Cw6 was also decreased in CML, whereas, HLA-A33 and Bw4 were decreased in SAA. Although the sample size of each disease was small, the increase of HLA-DR2 was observed in SAA in Thais which was similar to other studies in different ethnic groups. These preliminary data may be useful for further study in HLA and blood disease association.
