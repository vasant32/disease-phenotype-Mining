An adolescent male patient developed functional asplenia in the course of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for aplastic anemia. Coincident with the onset of the asplenia, amelioration of the ongoing GVHD was observed. Unexpectedly, after 34 months of functional asplenia, the organ regained its function without evidence of graft rejection or reactivation of GVHD.
