The specific antibody response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens of 41 bone marrow transplant recipients with leukemia or aplastic anemia was examined retrospectively by immunofluorescence test (IF) over 1 year. We observed high titers (greater than 640) of IgG-viral capsid antigen (VCA) with emergence of IgG-early antigen (EA) and frequent absence or low levels of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies. After absorption to remove rheumatoid factor (RF), five of the 41 recipients had IgM-VCA antibody to EBV, which appeared between weeks 26 and 48 after BMT and persisted for 1-4 months. No heterophil antibodies were detected in these sera, and none of the five recipients had a history of infectious mononucleosis.
