The presence of a new DNA virus (TTV) has been reported in sera from patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. The precise replication site of TTV, however, has not been established. In this study, the presence of TTV in liver autopsy material, and in bone marrow biopsy and autopsy samples taken from a subacute hepatitis/aplastic anemia patient was determined by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Liver cells were found to contain only TTV DNA and not mRNA. Bone marrow material, especially that taken at biopsy, contained high levels of TTV DNA. It is suggested that the TTV replication site was in the bone marrow rather than in the liver, and that TTV infection was the cause of this patient's aplastic anemia. The precise etiological association of TTV with hepatitis remains to be established.
