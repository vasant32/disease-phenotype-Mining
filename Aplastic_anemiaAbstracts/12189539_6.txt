A 27-year-old man with aplastic anemia and renal insufficiency requiring dialysis underwent allogeneic PBSCT. The preparative regimen consisted of melphalan, ATG and TLI. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and prednisolone. He was dialyzed prior to administration of melphalan and at 24 and 72 h after it. Otherwise, the dialysis schedule was unchanged, at three times a week. Engraftment was rapid. Regimen-related toxicity was minimal. Pharmacokinetic parameters of melphalan were not significantly altered with its plasma half-life 1.5 h. Patients with renal failure can receive allogeneic HSCT, and a combination of melphalan, ATG and TLI may serve as an alternative to CY and ATG.
