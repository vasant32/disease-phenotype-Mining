The authors evaluated antilymphocyte serum prepared in rabbits (ALS-R) as an alternative to antilymphocyte serum prepared in horses (ALG-H) in the therapy of aplastic anemia. Between 1980 and 1993, 57 evaluable patients received ALS-R and prednisone +/- cyclosporine +/- androgens. Standard response criteria were used and patients were evaluated at 3 months from the start of therapy. Median age was 43 years. Disease was present for up to 2 months in 24 patients, 2-5 months in 14 patients, and 6 months or more in 19 patients. Disease was severe in 30 patients and moderate in 27. Responses occurred in 16 (28%) of 57 patients. Responses were more frequent in females, in patients treated within 6 months of diagnosis, and in patients with severe disease. Among patients receiving ALS-R and cyclosporine within 2 months of diagnosis, 46% responded. After ALS-R therapy, 20 patients received ALG-H; 8 (40%) of 20 responded. Eight patients receiving ALS-R previously had received ALG-H; 2 (25%) of these 8 patients responded. Toxicity of ALS-R was minimal. Antilymphocyte serum prepared in rabbits, in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents, represents an effective alternative to ALG-H in aplastic anemia, especially in patients previously treated with ALG-H.
