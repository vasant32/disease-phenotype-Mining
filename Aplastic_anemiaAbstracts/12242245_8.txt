The ligand for the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is Kit ligand (Kitl; also known as mast cell growth factor, stem cell factor, and Steel factor), which is encoded at the Steel (Sl) locus of mice. Previous studies revealed that Kitl(Sl) mutations have semidominant effects; mild pigmentation defects and macrocytic, hypoplastic anemia occur in heterozygous mice, and more severe pigmentation defects and anemia occur in homozygotes. Lethality also occurs in mice homozygous for severe Kitl(Sl) mutations. We describe the effects of seven new N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced Kitl(Sl) mutations and two previously characterized severe Kitl(Sl) mutations on pigmentation, peripheral blood cells, and mouse survival. Mice heterozygous for each of the nine mutations had reduced coat pigmentation and macrocytosis of peripheral blood. In the case of some of these mutations, however, red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin concentrations, and hematocrits were normal in heterozygotes, even though homozygotes exhibited severely reduced RBC counts and lethality. In homozygous mice, the extent of anemia generally correlates with effects on viability for most Kitl(Sl) mutations; i.e., most mutations that cause lethality also cause a more severe anemia than that of mutations that allow viability. Interestingly, lethality and anemia were not directly correlated in the case of one Kitl(Sl) mutation.
