This report describes a patient who had severe refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia during her first pregnancy. She had a remission after delivery but two years later aplastic anemia refractory to steroid and splenectomy developed. After treatment with steroids and antithymocyte globulin the patient had repeated infusions of hemopoietic cells derived from fetal liver and bone marrow, leading to a 7-year remission during which time she had a further successful pregnancy. The patient had a relapse one year later.
