The course of two cases of severe aplastic anemia (AA) was followed up in two young male patients who, besides the conventional therapy, received perfusions with blood obtained from patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Case 1 received 4 units of PV blood from a unique donor. During the following week an obvious clinical relief, as well as increase of the peripheral blood values were recorded. Subsequently, the bone marrow was progressively repopulated with normal precursors and the peripheral blood picture reverted to normal. In case 2, 9 units of PV blood, obtained from two donors, were administered. During the next week a transient clinical and hematological improvement was obtained, but later on the progressive granulocytopenia and the infections led to exitus through a toxic-septic shock. It is assumed that PV blood may be a good replacing and a possible stimulatory therapeutic material, useful to overcome the early critical stage of severe AA.
