Erythropoietin titers when related to the hematocrit percentage and measured by bioassay in 33 normal volunteers and in 61 patients with anemias not complicated by renal or chronic disease were found to overlap with titers measured by radioimmunoassay in 20 normals and 28 patients with similar anemias. Erythropoietin titers measured by radioimmunoassay in 34 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 25 patients with sickle cell anemia (58 separate samples), and 28 patients with erythroid hypoplasia caused by hematologic malignancies were compared with those in the control group of patients with uncomplicated anemias and found not to differ significantly from titers in this group. Erythropoietin titers measured by bioassay in 12 patients with aplastic anemia also fell within the range of those in the control group. Consequently, erythropoietin titers in these anemias appear to be determined primarily by the degree of anemia and not by any specific effect of these illnesses on the production of erythropoietin.
