The diagnosis of aplastic anemia in children requires exclusion of a variety of inherited or acquired BM failure syndromes with similar phenotypes. An efficient diagnostic plan is important because time from diagnosis to 'final' treatment is directly related to outcome regardless of the therapeutic option chosen. The gold standard of therapy remains hematopoietic SCT with a graft of BM cells for those children with matched sibling donors. Conversely for children without a sibling donor the high response and markedly improved overall survival rates of combined immunosuppressive therapy have proven robust, especially when horse derived anti-thymocyte globuline plus ciclosporine A are used. Incomplete response, relapse and progression to myelodysplasia/leukemia however have emerged as significant long-term issues. Improvements in outcome of alternative donor transplantation and the use of established and novel immunosuppressive agents provide multiple alternatives for treating refractory or relapsed patients. Regardless of the type of therapeutic approach, patients require centralized treatment in a center of excellence, ongoing monitoring for recurrence of disease and/or therapy-related immediate side effects and long-term effects.
