Autopsy findings of missed diagnoses that would probably have changed management or prognosis occur in up to 29% of cases in general hospitals. Such proportions may be higher in subsets of patients with complex diseases. We reviewed 2908 consecutive autopsies performed over a period of 29 months in a large-volume hospital, analyzing 118 autopsies of patients with hematological malignancies or severe aplastic anemia. A review of macroscopic reports as well as microscopic examination of tissue samples was performed. Medical records were reviewed for clinical diagnoses. Discordances between clinical and autopsy diagnoses were classified using Goldman's criteria. Additionally, we searched for clinical parameters correlated with occurrence of class-I discrepancy using a multivariate method. Median age was 46.5 years, and 25.4% had received a hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Overall, 11.9% (6.6-19.1%) of patients died before conclusion of the hematological diagnosis and 33% (24.6-42.3%) died with no active hematological disease. We found class-I discrepancy in 31.3% (23.1-40.5 %) of cases. The most common among these diagnoses were hematological disease, pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding. In a univariate analysis, being elderly (P=0.04) was positively correlated with the finding of class-I discrepancies; while, having received previous specific hematological treatment (P=0.0005) or hematopoietic stem-cell transplants (P=0.013), or being admitted to a specialized hematology unit (P=0.0006) were negatively correlated to the occurrence of such discrepancies. Multivariate analysis showed that care in a specialized hematology unit (OR 0.34, 0.12-0.93) was independently associated with lower occurrence of discrepancies. We concluded that critical diagnoses are often missed in highly complex hematological patients especially in the absence of admission to specialized hematology units.
