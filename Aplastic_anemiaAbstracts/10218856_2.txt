A 14-year-old patient with acquired very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from his HLA-identical brother. Preparative therapy was cyclophosphamide (CY) 200 mg/kg over 4 days. GVHD prophylaxis was with cyclosporin A (CsA) for a year. After an 8 year follow-up during which the patient was well with normal blood counts, graft failure occurred. At this time marrow chimerism studies demonstrated that 85% of hemopoiesis was of recipient origin. The patient was re-engrafted from the same donor after conditioning with CY 200 mg/kg over 4 days plus rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 3.5 mg/kg/day for 3 days. After 140 days follow-up he has a normal blood count. The possible causes of the graft failure are discussed. This case demonstrates that, although rarely, very late graft failure may occur after BMT for AA and highlights the need for long-term monitoring even in apparently successfully transplanted patients.
