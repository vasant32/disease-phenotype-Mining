The objective of this study was to investigate the expressions of hematopoietic cytokines EPO, SCF and GM-CSF in bone marrow cells of patients with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) and their significance. The mRNA expressions of EPO, SCF and GM-CSF from 35 CAA patients and 10 healthy individuals were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the levels of EPO, SCF and GM-CSF in CAA patients were obviously lower than those in the healthy individuals (p < 0.01). It is concluded that the immunity disorder mediated by hematopoietic cytokines is one of the pathogenesis in the CAA patients, it provided theoretical basis for guiding clinical treatment.
