Comparative data on the content of fluorine in various sections of the left femur distal part, i.e. spongy bone, process zone and articular cartilage are presented. The examination was performed on postmortem sections from 10 pediatric cases (the average age of 9.5 years) with mucoviscidosis or aplastic anemia treated before the death for up to 12 months with ciprofloxacin in a dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg body weight. The control postmortem sections were from 10 practically healthy children (the average age of 10.4 years) killed in a car accident. The sections were subjected to 2-stage dry ashing with ionometric determination of the fluorine ions. The results were treated according to the V.Yu. Urbach procedure. It was shown that the content of fluorine in the sponge bone and process zone in both the groups did not significantly differ. A comparatively high content of fluorine was detected only in the postmortem sections of the articular cartilage from the children of the main group who however had no chondrotoxic symptoms while alive. That means that the difference is statistically and clinically insignificant.
