Although chloramphenicol is not approved for use in food-producing animals in the United States, this broad spectrum antibiotic has been widely used to treat diseases in such animals including the lactating dairy cow. Extremely low ophthalmologic doses of chloramphenicol are known to cause aplastic anemia in humans. The residues in meat, milk, and eggs intended for human consumption cause particular public health concern because the bone marrow aplasia is not dose dependent. Furthermore, chloramphenicol, a known inhibitor of protein synthesis, also retards erythropoiesis, a condition that is dose dependent and may cause allergic hypersensitivity reactions. This paper is a review of sensitive methods that use gas, liquid, thin layer, and simple column chromatography as both determinative and cleanup steps for detecting and quantitating chloramphenicol in edible animal tissues, milk, and eggs.
