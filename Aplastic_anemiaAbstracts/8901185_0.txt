Only few reports about ALL after aplastic anaemias in childhood exist. It remains still unclear which immunophenotypes of the leukaemias must be expected thereafter. Here it is reported about two children with quite different immunophenotypes of the leukaemic cells. In the first one the most common type was found, the constellation of a c-ALL, whereas in the other the precise classification was impossible at all. Myeloic and T-cell markers were present at the same time. This form of leukaemia was not influenced therapeutically in a sufficient manner. The patient died after recovery phases of only short duration. After aplastic anaemias with fast recovery by prednisolone ALL of different constellation has to be expected. Therefore the antileukaemic treatment immediately after recovery of the aplastic anaemia should be taken into consideration.
