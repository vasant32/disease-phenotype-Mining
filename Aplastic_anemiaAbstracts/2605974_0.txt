Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were measured by C1q-solid phase method in ninety-five patients with various hematologic diseases. The results showed significantly higher CIC levels in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) than CIC levels in normal controls. However, there was no significant difference in such levels in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma when compared to normal controls. In this study, the level of CIC did not relate to prognosis for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The findings demonstrated that a high level of CIC in patients with ITP usually responded poorly to steroid treatment. Other immunosuppressive agents were indicated in these cases. Therefore, the CIC level may serve as a therapeutic guide for the treatment of patients with ITP.
