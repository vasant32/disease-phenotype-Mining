We described a patient of refractory cytomegalovirus (CMV) limbic encephalitis who received matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation. Pyrosequencing study on serial cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed the emergence of resistant strains associated with exposure of antiviral agents. Combinations of antiviral agents had a role in partial suppression of CMV viral load but the clearance of virus mainly relied on the recovery of host's immunity and resulted in intact survival of host. Donor's CMV-seronegative status may contribute to the delay in controlling this serious infection. Prompt identification of drug-resistant mutant helps in selection of antiviral agents.
