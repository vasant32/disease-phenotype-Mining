The physiopathogeny of aplastic anemia is still unknown, it can be related to a stem cell defect or a microenvironment disease. An autoimmune origin is suspected but not as yet proved. To demonstrate the autoimmune origin of some cases of aplastic anemia, we have studied the effect of antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) on the hematopoiesis of aplastic patients by serial hematological and bone marrow investigation including blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, scanning with indium and technetium and granulocytic colonies in agar, 8 out of 17 patients had a response to ALG as shown by a rise of granulocytes and reticulocytes counts, increase of bone marrow cellularity and number of granulocytic colonies. This study tends to show that ALG has a stimulating effect on hematopoiesis in some cases of severe aplastic anemia.
