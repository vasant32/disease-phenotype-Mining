Acquired aplastic anemia is a rare hematologic disease characterized by a hypoplastic bone marrow and peripheral pnacytopenia. In severe cases, where conservative medical management has been unsuccessful, bone marrow transplantation is now being performed. Between the years 1971 and 1975, twenty-two patients with severe aplastic anemia were seen at the Children's Hospital Medical Center. This article discusses the oral presentations of aplastic anemia and the dental management of nine patients without and thirteen with transplantations.
