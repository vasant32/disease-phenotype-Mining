Previously, we and others have shown that fetal liver infusion (FLI) leads to autologous hematopoietic improvement in 40-54% of patients with aplastic anemia. However, whether this recovery was spontaneous or the effect of the infused liver cells was not clear. To dissect the role of FLI in autologous hematopoietic recovery, the colony-supporting potential of fetal liver-conditioned medium (FLCM) was evaluated in bone marrow (BM) cells of normal adult and aplastic anemia patients. In both cases, each sample of FLCM supported the growth of colony-forming cells in semi solid culture medium. The FLCM was assayed for the presence of four principal colony-stimulating cytokines, namely stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (Epo). While GM-CSF, IL-3, and Epo were present in insignificant amounts or were altogether absent, 50-635 pg/ml of SCF was found in 8 of the 13 FLCM samples tested. Preliminary results of bioneutralization assay indicated the possible role of SCF, secreted by the FL cells, in colony-supporting activity of aplastic anemia and normal BM cells. Overall, our in vitro study implicates the paracrine role of infused FL cells in regenerating autologous hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia patients.
