The clinical and biological spectrum of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is variable, ranging from classical hemolytic forms to PNH associated with aplastic anemia or other bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes. We report a previously undescribed case of PNH occurring after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in a patient affected by relapsing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The intensive chemotherapy and the ASCT resulted in a contraction of the effective hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool and a derangement of the immune system. The delayed engraftment and the BM hypoplasia represented a favorable environment for the expansion of the pathological clone. This case is paradigmatic even for the unexpected trend of the PNH clone during treatment with the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab; in fact, the clone reduced until undergoing unexpected extinction, i.e. the recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Eculizumab seems not to play a direct role in HSC kinetics; the clinical remission probably occurred because the environmental conditions that led to the expansion of the PNH clone were transient and disappeared.
