Using procedures that were effective in the purification of human urinary erythropoietin (Epo), we attempted initial purification of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factors (CSF) in urinary extracts from patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Comparison of colony stimulation by purified human Epo and crude urinary extracts revealed: (1) that the pure Epo augments megakaryocyte colony formation in culture and (2) MEG-CSF activity is also present in materials other than Epo in the crude urinary extracts from the two types of patients. Similar to purification of Epo, ethanol precipitation and sulfopropyl-Sephadex chromatography provided twofold and threefold increases in the specific activity of MEG-CSF, respectively. In contrast to Epo, however, significant inactivation of MEG-CSF activity was seen with phenol treatment. The elution profile of MEG-CSF seen on hydroxylapatite chromatography of urinary extracts was different from that of Epo. These data provided a basis for initial steps for purification of MEG-CSF and support the notion that MEG-CSF is distinct from Epo.
