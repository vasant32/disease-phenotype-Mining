Erythropoietin (Epo) gene expression was studied in a number of different haemopoietic cell lines by in situ hybridization and Northern Blot analysis using a radioisotope-labelled monkey Epo DNA probe. A positive message was expressed by a human cell line, CM-S, derived from a patient with congenital hypoplastic anemia, and by a murine erythro-leukaemic cell line, clone 707, derived from the spleen of Friend virus-infected mice. No message was detected in two megakaryoblastic cell lines, and in a monocytic cell line, derived from a patient with acute monocytic leukaemia. These data may fit with the hypothesis of expression of Epo and other growth factors by haemopoietic cells through a mechanism of so-called autocrine secretion.
