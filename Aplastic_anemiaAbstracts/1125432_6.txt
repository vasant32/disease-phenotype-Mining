From 1967 to 1972, 70 patients with aplastic anemia were observed and followed up to death or at least two years. 3 cases of pure red cell anemia, and 2 cases of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia are included. Detailed investigation of drugs taken within 6 months before onset of the disease revealed chloramphenicol in 20, butazones in 11 cases. Acute viral hepatitis preceded the hemopoietic failure in 2 patients. In addition to various combinations of anemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, monocytes were diminished in 35 and lymphocytes in 12 cases. Acid serum or sucrose tests were consistently negative. The patients were treated by short-term prednisone, long-term androgens and red cell and platelet substitution as needed. 2 years after onset of the disease, 33 per cent were in partial or complete remission, 30 per cent survived without remission, and 35 per cent had decreased. Correlation of various parameters with remission and survival showed the presence of a subgroup at risque, comprising patients with low marrow cellularity and clinically relevant diminution of all three cell lines at the time of diagnosis. Absolute lymphopenia and increase of plasma cells in the bone marrow were of poor prognostic significance. In this subgroup two years after the onset of the disease only 32 percent survivors and 16 per cent remissions were recorded. There was no conclusive evidence for the therapeutic value of prednisone or androgens in our series. The present situation in severe aplastic anemia requires more effective forms of treatment and justifies experimental therapies like bone marrow transplantation.
