A 53-year-old female infected with human T lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) suffered from chronic renal failure, aplastic anemia, myelopathy, uveitis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome and Weber-Christian disease. Although HTLV-I antibody was negative in cerebrospinal fluid, she was diagnosed as HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) based on clinical and histological findings. Though to date there is no direct evidence, other complications have also been reported to be HTLV-I related diseases. This case provided the unique opportunity to observe various HTLV-I related diseases.
