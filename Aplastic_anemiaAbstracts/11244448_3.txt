A 14-year-old girl developed very severe aplastic anemia unresponsive to steroids, cyclosporine, ATG and filgrastim. She experienced repeated bacterial infections, hypermenorrhagia and epistaxis and received numerous transfusions. Lacking a matched family or unrelated donor, she was transplanted 6 months after diagnosis with CD34+ cell-enriched peripheral stem cells from her HLA-haploidentical uncle. Conditioning included fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 800 cGy TLI and OKT3. Prompt and sustained trilineage engraftment occurred. Acute GVHD grade 1 and herpes esophagitis were successfully treated. Eight months after grafting she was well with stable hematopoiesis. She then succumbed to fulminant hepatic failure due to adenovirus infection.
