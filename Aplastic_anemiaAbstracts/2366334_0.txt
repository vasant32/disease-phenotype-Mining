Twenty children with various hematological malignancies (nine with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, eight with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, two with chronic myelogenous leukemia, one with malignant lymphoma and one with 7-monosomy) and four with severe aplastic anemia were treated with allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) between September 1977 and September 1988. Eleven patients are surviving currently and ten are disease free 8 to 51 months after BMT. Conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide in twenty patients. Two patients did not receive TBI. Graft failure was observed in five patients and complete recovery of recipient marrow was seen in two of them. Eleven patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) with grade I-II in eight patients. Three patients suffered from chronic GvHD. Seven patients with acute leukemia relapsed and all but one died of leukemia. Early death occurred in two undergone BMT in poor clinical conditions. Performance status in 100% in surviving patients except one. Efforts to improve these results are that BMT should be considered early in the course of their disease for patients who are at risk for relapse with conventional chemotherapy and improved conditioning regimens to reduce leukemia relapse after BMT for patient with the second or subsequent remission.
