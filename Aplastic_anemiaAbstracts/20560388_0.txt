A 31-year-old woman with aplastic anemia was admitted for the management of delivery at 33 weeks of gestation. Platelet count was 2.3 x 10(4) x microl(-1) on admission. Corticosteroid therapy after admission was not effective, and we decided to manage the delivery with elective cesarean section after platelet transfusion. After forty units of platelet transfusion, platelet count was 8.1 x 10(4) x microl(-1), and we decided to perform cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was given using a 25-gauge Quincke needle at L3-4 interspace, and 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 2.5 ml with 0.15 mg morphine was injected. Block level was confirmed as T8 by a pinprick method. Blood loss during operation was 858 g, and complications were not seen during operation. In the case of delivery with uncontrolled aplastic anemia, elective cesarean section is thought to be safe. If platelet count is over 5.0 x 10(4) x microl(-1) after platelet transfusion, spinal anesthesia should be used.
