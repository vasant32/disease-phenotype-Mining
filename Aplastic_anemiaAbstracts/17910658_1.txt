The data of allogeneic HSCT in nine children with acquired AA between June 1998 and July 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. The median duration of time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 18 and 25 days, respectively. None of the patients had primary graft failure. Two (22.2%) patients developed acute GVHD and of these, one (11.1%) was Grade 1, and the other (11.1%) was Grade 3. Although the study group was composed of higher risk patients, including six of nine resistant to previous immunosuppressive treatment, eight had multiple not irradiated or filtered transfusion histories and one of the cases was only 5/6 HLA-compatible with his donor, the five-yr overall and EFS was 100%, and all recipients are alive without any graft failure. This may be attributed to the dose adjusted use of ATG according to individual transfusion history and gradual tapering of CsA and cessation at least nine months after allogeneic HSCT.
