A 78 year old woman developed non-fatal pure red cell aplasia after taking Indomethacin for a long period. We gave the patient red cell transfusions and treated her with Methylprednisolon. Approximately 3 months after discontinuation of Indomethacin the patient felt well and blood picture was normal.
