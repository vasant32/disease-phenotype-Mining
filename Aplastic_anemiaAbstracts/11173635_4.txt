The association between severe aplastic anemia (AA) and DR2 antigen seems to be well established. However, since discrimination between two DR2-associated splits, namely DR15 and DR16, rarely was performed, it remains unclear whether one or both of these subvariants are responsible for AA susceptibility. In this study, we have analyzed the HLA-DR allelic distribution in a group of 37 AA patients of slavic origin from North-Western Russia. The experimental design included PCR-based amplification of DRB-specific sequences, followed by reverse dot-blot hybridization of the biotinylated PCR-product with the set of sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. HLA-DRB alleles were identified by non-radioactive enzymatic reaction, then standard serological specificities of HLA-DR antigen were estimated according to the WHO nomenclature. Whereas DR15 subtype occurred more often in the patients (23.0% vs. 13.3%, p< 0.05), DR16 split did not show the same tendency. The results, show the overall predominance of HLA-DR2 specificity (DR15+DR16) did not reach statistical significance (24.4% vs.17.5%, p<0.2). Thus, we conclude that repeatedly reported DR2 frequency increase in AA patients is mainly attributed to the prevalence of DR15 subtype.
