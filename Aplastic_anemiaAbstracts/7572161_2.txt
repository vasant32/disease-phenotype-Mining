This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of hypoparathyroidism and hypothyroidism due to secondary hemochromatosis with onset during childhood. The patient was a boy with refractory aplastic anemia in whom primary hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism became apparent at the age of 10 and 11 years old, respectively. He had received a total of 100 L of transfused blood by the age of 10 years. The patient showed poor annual height gain due to primary hypothyroidism, together with hypocalcemia, cataract and intracranial calcification due to hypoparathyroidism. The early appearance of both thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in this patient may have been due to the delay of initiation of iron-chelating agents and liver dysfunction due to hepatitis type C.
