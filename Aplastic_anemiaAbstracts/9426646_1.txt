BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has been reported in patients with fulminant hepatitis and aplastic anemia, but HGV RNA has also been found in healthy individuals. The possible associations of HGV with liver function and hematologic abnormalities in asymptomatic blood donors were investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum HGV RNA was determined in 200 repeat donors (Group A), 44 subjects with elevated alanine aminotransferase (Group B), and 54 hepatitis C virus carriers (Group C). Liver histology was evaluated in Group C by using the histologic activity index. RESULTS: HGV RNA was detected in three subjects of Group A (1.5%; 95% CI: 0.3-4.3), two of Group B (4.5%; 95% CI: 0.6-15.5%), and six of Group C (11.1%; 95% CI: 4.2-22.6). The prevalence of leukopenia and elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was higher in the 11 viremic donors than in 88 nonviremic subjects (36% vs. 2.3%, and 55% vs. 22%, respectively; p < 0.05), matched for clinical and demographic characteristics. The mean histologic activity index score +/- standard error was 4 +/- 0.7 in the HGV RNA-positive donors and 3.4 +/- 0.3 in the HGV RNA-negative donors. CONCLUSION: HGV is endemic in Italian blood donors, although it has a limited role in causing liver damage. Further studies are needed to clarify its role in inducing transfusion-associated disease in myelosuppression.
