Bone marrow of patients with hematological diseases contains a great number of erythroclasic clusters characterized by exocytic lysis of the constituent erythrocytes by cluster-forming myelocaryocytes including erythrocaryocytes. The content of erythroclasic clusters with exocytic lysis of erythrocytes varied from 21% of total erythroclasic clusters in bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia to 81% in bone marrow of patients with an active phase of acute lymphoblastic leukemia showing high intensity of hemolysis in the bone marrow. Most intensive lysis of erythrocytes in erythroclasic clusters took place in the bone marrow of patients in an active stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. At the time of the investigation tens of thousands of erythrocytes were undergoing destruction in erythroclasic clusters in one mcl of bone marrow of such patients. These findings confirm the idea of the bone marrow as an organ of erythrocyte destruction.
