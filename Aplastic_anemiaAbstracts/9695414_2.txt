A 21-year-old male patient with non-A, non-B, non-C acute hepatitis was complicated by hepatitis-associated severe aplastic anemia during hospitalization for active hepatitis. He was promptly diagnosed and treated with methylprednisolone, anabolic steroids, cyclosporin A, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). He responded quickly to the immuno-suppressive therapy and was transfusion independent after 25 days and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor independent at 57 days after ATG therapy. Although the etiology of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is still controversial, the authors emphasized the importance to carefully follow non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis patients without aplastic anemia for more than three months after hepatitis episodes in order to improve outcome of this lethal disease.
