CD52 is a phosphatidylinositolglycan (PIG)-anchored glycoprotein (PIG-AP) expressed on normal T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and the majority of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We observed the emergence of CD52- T cells in 3 patients after intravenous treatment with the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath-1H for refractory B-cell lymphoma and could identify the underlaying mechanism. In addition to the absence of CD52, the PIG-AP CD48 and CD59 were not detectable on the CD52- T cells in 2 patients. PIG-AP-deficient T-cell clones from both patients were established. Analysis of the mRNA of the PIG-A gene showed an abnormal size in the T-cell clones from 1 of these patients, suggesting that a mutation in the PIG-A gene was the cause of the expression defect of PIG-AP. An escape from an immune attack directed against PIG-AP+ hematopoiesis has been hypothesized as the cause of the occurrence of PIG-AP-deficient cells in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and aplastic anemia. Our results support the hypothesis that an attack against the PIG-AP CD52 might lead to the expansion of a PIG-anchor-deficient cell population with the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of PNH cells.
