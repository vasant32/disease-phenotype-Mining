A 29-year-old male patient presented with acute liver failure from non-A, non-B and non-C hepatitis, necessitating orthotopic liver transplantation. After operation he developed progressive pancytopenia on the basis of aplastic anemia, which was probably hepatitis associated. After therapy with GM-CSF had failed, he underwent allogeneic BMT from his HLA genotypically identical brother following a conditioning regimen of CY 50 mg/kg x 4 and 500 cGy total lymphoid irradiation. He engrafted promptly but transfusion dependency did not resolve until CMV viremia was treated with ganciclovir. The patient is alive and well 2 years after BMT.
