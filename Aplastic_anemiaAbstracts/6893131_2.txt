Morphologic and chromium release studies demonstrated degeneration in monolayer cultures of endothelial cells exposed to the anabolic steroidal hormone oxymetholone. The concentrations approximated those occurring transiently in the hepatic sinusoidal blood after oral administration of the drug during treatment for aplastic anemia. It is suggested that damage to sinusoidal endothelium, with impairment of its ability to maintain sinusoidal collagenous reticulin, is a mechanism by which oxymetholone can cause peliosis hepatis in these patients.
