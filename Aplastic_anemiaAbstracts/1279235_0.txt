A 32 year-old female admitted to our hospital with pancytopenia. The hematological data on admission were: RBC: 247 x 10(4)/microliters, Hb: 8.8 g/dl, Plts: 13,000/microliters, WBC: 2,500/microliters. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsied specimen showed marked hypocellularity without infiltration of abnormal cells. A diagnosis of aplastic anemia was made. Neither high-dose methyl-prednisolone pulse therapy nor anti-lymphocyte globulin were effective. With combination of oxymetholone (30 mg/day), recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo; 12,000 U/day, three times a week) and recombinant granulocyte-colony simulating factor (rHuG-CSF; 33 micrograms/day) for 3 months, remarkable improvements of hematological data were obtained. Her hemoglobin level reached 11.4 g/dl, and platelets count 49,000/microliters. However, 4 weeks after the withdrawal of erythropoietin and G-CSF administrations, her platelet count fell to 12,000/microliters. It was suggested that combination therapy with erythropoietin and G-CSF were effective for aplastic anemia.
