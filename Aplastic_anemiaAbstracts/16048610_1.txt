This report describes a teenager who developed aplastic anemia (AA) because of non-A-E acute liver failure (ALF) requiring orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). His AA did not recover spontaneously and he required treatment with ATG 9 months post-OLT. Bone marrow recovery occurred 4 months after immunotherapy and coincided with further intensification of immunusuppression required to treat early chronic rejection of the liver graft. Three years post-OLT he remains well with good bone marrow and liver function. Intensification of immunosuppression can lead to successful resolution of AA associated with non-A-E ALF.
