Candida parapsilosis is a very common and saprophytic fungus. Its pathogenic role has been reported in intensive care units after invasive instrumentations. We report a case of dermal candidiasis due to Candida parapsilosis occurring in an immunocompromised patient suffering from aplastic anemia treated with corticosteroids. The histopathological aspect was non specific, showing a polymorphous granulomatous reaction in the middermis. Findings of periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott-Gomori stains revealed a large number of pseudohyphae and spores. Candida parasilosis was cultured from a skin biopsy. The route of skin infection is discussed: direct inoculation or septic localization after fungemia.
