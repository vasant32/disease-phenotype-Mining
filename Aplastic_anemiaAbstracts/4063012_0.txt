Activity of adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) was studied in thrombocytes of donors and patients with various hematological diseases. The enzymatic activity was decreased in acute leukemia, chronic myeloleukemia, chronic leukemia and blast transformation myeloma, microspherocytic and hypoplastic anemias. Variable level of the activity was observed in chronic lympholeukemia and non-Hodgkin disease. In all the diseases studied functions of thrombocytes were altered after treatment with various aggregating agents (ADP, thrombin, collagen, adrenaline, ristomycin).
