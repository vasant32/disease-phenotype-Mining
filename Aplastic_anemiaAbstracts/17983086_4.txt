Although neutropenia is recognized as a risk factor for infection and compromised wound healing, there are little data regarding the specific impact of neutropenia on morbidity and mortality after placement of implanted central venous catheters (CVC). We conducted a retrospective review of children with a diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia or aplastic anemia who received a CVC over a 5-year period. The absolute neutrophil count immediately before catheter placement was recorded. Three hundred eight catheters were placed in 195 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 15 with aplastic anemia. Absolute neutrophil count was less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L in 105 cases (Group 1). The incidence of CVC removal for all causes and for infection within 100 days in Group 1 was 17.1 per cent and 11.4 per cent, respectively, compared with 7.9 per cent (P = 0.01) and 1.5 per cent (P < 0.0001) with absolute neutrophil count 0.5 x 10(9)/L or greater (Group 2). Infections included two cases of mucormycosis with one death. Ports were more likely than Hickman catheters (C. R. Bard Inc., Murray Hill, NJ) to be removed for all causes (P = 0.01) and for infection (P = 0.04). The placement of implanted central venous catheters in neutropenic children was associated with substantial infectious morbidity and one death. When possible, CVC, particularly ports, should be avoided in the presence of neutropenia.
