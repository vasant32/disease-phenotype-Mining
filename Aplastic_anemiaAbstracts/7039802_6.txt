Between February 1971 and October 1980, 34 patients with leukemia or aplastic anemia received bone marrow transplants from HLA-identical siblings whose lymphocytes did not react in a mixed leukocyte culture. The donors of 10 patients were ABO-incompatible, and for five pairs the ABO incompatibility was major. Plasma exchanges followed by a red blood cell exchange transfusion reduced the anti-A titres to 1:4 or less in these patients. The ABO incompatibility had no adverse effect on the results of marrow transplantation. Twenty-two patients, including 16 of the 20 who received their transplant after Jan. 1, 1980, are still living. Seven of the 15 patients with acute leukemia have survived 89 to 466 days, and 4 of the 6 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have survived 117 to 545 days. Of the 13 patients with aplastic anemia, 11 are alive up to 8 years after transplantation. Marrow transplantation, when possible, is the treatment of choice for young patients with acute leukemia in remission and for patients with aplastic anemia. Marrow transplantation may also prove to be effective in patients with CML.
