Aplastic anaemia (AA) of the chronic type with severe cytopenia is very frequently a difficult therapeutic problem. Patients with granulocyte values below 0.5 G/l are threatened by infections, incl. sepsis possibly with a fatal outcome. If the pool of stem cells for granulocytes is not completely exhausted and can respond to growth factors, these patients can be treated either chronically and/or in risk situations (e.g. injury, surgery) with preparations of the type of a recombinant, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), or granulocyte and monocyte colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). The authors present a review of diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in patients with the AA syndrome and summarize their own experience with the preparation Neupogen Roche (rhG-CSF).
