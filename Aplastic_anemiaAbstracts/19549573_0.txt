Infectious diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies, severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and myelodysplasia. Major advances in infectious diseases supportive care have been critical to improving the outcome of patients suffering from these life-threatening diseases. Advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of life-threatening infections have reduced morbidity and mortality, improved quality of life, and enabled the use of potentially curative chemotherapy, radiation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and immunosuppressive therapy to patients battling these devastating diseases. Despite these advances, the continued development of antimicrobial resistance, emergence of new pathogens, and the evolution of host factors present evolving challenges to the successful management of infectious complications in this expanding patient population.
