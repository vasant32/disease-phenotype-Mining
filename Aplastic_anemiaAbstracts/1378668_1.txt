This investigation is retrospective and comprises 20 patients with bone-marrow insufficiency. During the period 1.4.1988-1.3.1991, these patients were treated with erythropoietin (Epo), the granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or the granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Thirteen patients had primary bone-marrow insufficiency: six had the myelodysplastic syndrome, three had primary myelofibrosis, two aplastic anemia and two myelomatosis. On account of dominating symptoms of anemia, five patients received Epo while eight received GM-CSF as part of an extensive clinical trial of this preparation. Seven patients with relapse of the haematological malignant disease had bone-marrow insufficiency and pancytopenia secondary to intensive chemotherapy/irradiation: four of these patients received GM-CSF and two received G-CSF with the object of increasing bone-marrow regeneration and to render further chemotherapy possible. One patient received GM-CSF with the object of improving bone-marrow function after autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Treatment with Epo for ten months combined with treatment with interferon for six months resulted in normalization of the haemoglobin concentration in one patient with bone-marrow insufficiency on account of primary myelofibrosis. Treatment with Epo for briefer periods in lower doses was without effect in four other patients with primary bone-marrow insufficiency. Treatment with GM-CSF and G-CSF resulted in neutrophil leukocytosis in 12 out of 15 patients (80%) and, in six out of 14 patients (43%), increased marrow cellularity was demonstrated by means of histological examination of the bone-marrow. One patient showed normal haemoglobin levels during treatment with GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
