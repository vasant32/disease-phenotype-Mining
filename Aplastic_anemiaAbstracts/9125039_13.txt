Both ganciclovir-sensitive and -resistant human cytomegaloviruses (HCMV) were isolated from a patient with aplastic anemia complicated with CMV retinitis and encephalitis. Ganciclovir-resistant clinical isolate, 93-1R, also showed cross-resistance against (s)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine (cidofovir). Molecular analysis of plaque-cloned strains revealed that a single nucleotide substitution at 2160 (C to T) resulted in amino acid substitution at codon 501 from leucine to phenylalanine in the DNA polymerase gene. This mutation at codon 501 was easily identified by means of AluI digestion of the selected PCR product. The same mutation existed in the DNA fragment amplified from the patient's brain, suggesting that cross-resistant mutant 93-1R caused encephalitis. Furthermore, ganciclovir-resistant 93-1R-3 replicated much faster and was released more efficiently into the culture medium than ganciclovir-sensitive 91-7S-1.
