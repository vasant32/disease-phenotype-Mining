A 30-year-old Japanese woman with acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA), diagnosed 20 years ago, was referred to our institution for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). As an unusual case of long-standing SAA, the patient was complicated with moderate heart failure due to secondary hemochromatosis. After successful SCT using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, she needed no transfusion. Five years after SCT, echocardiography showed a dramatic improvement of her cardiac function. This case indicates that the cardiac function in secondary hemochromatosis could be reversed once iron overload from multitransfusions is stopped.
