Treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients who lack human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors and failed immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is challenging. Recently, umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) after non-myeloablative therapy has been reported in adult but not in childhood SAA. However, most cases resulted in mixed donor chimerism and incomplete hematological recovery. We reported an 11-yr-old girl with recurred SAA 5 yr after IST who underwent unrelated donor CBT after a modified regimen. This patient had renal and cardiac dysfunction, and lacked suitable bone marrow donors. The 3.9 x 10(7)/kg CB cells from an HLA one-locus mismatched unrelated donor were infused after conditioning with total body irradiation (5 Gy), melphalan (120 mg/m(2)), and fludarabin (120 mg/m(2)). Hematological recovery was favorable in complete chimerism. A major complication was only skin graft-versus-host disease (grade I). CB could be an alternate stem cell source for childhood SAA after modified preparative regimen.
