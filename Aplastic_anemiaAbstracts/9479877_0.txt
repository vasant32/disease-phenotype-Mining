Selective neutropenia lasting over five months occurred in a 17-year-old adolescent male who received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling for severe aplastic anemia. Bone marrow specimens showed maturation arrest of myeloid precursor cells despite sustained engraftment. Cytogenetic analyses revealed complete donor-type chimerism in hematopoietic cells and mixed lymphoid chimerism. The patient received a second BMT from the same donor following more intensive conditioning, including total body irradiation. Neutrophil recovery was rapid and complete donor-type hematopoietic and lymphoid chimerism was observed within three weeks of the second transplant. The present case suggests that prolonged selective neutropenia following BMT is due to residual host-derived immunity which is resistant to the standard immunosuppressive conditioning used prior to BMT for aplastic anemia.
