The essential features of aplastic anemia by chloramphenicol are outlined. Then a detailed evaluation of possible chloramphenicol residues in foods of animal origin is given, showing that these residues may be either original chloramphenicol and/or numerous, partly radical, metabolites of chloramphenicol. Further discussion of the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia by chloramphenicol reveals that this anemia is the result of an inhibition of DNA synthesis in bone marrow by covalently bound chloramphenicol metabolites. The aromatic nitro group of chloramphenicol is but of indirect importance and does not take part in the binding of the molecule. The final critical examination of chloramphenicol residues demonstrates, that these residues amy potentially cause aplastic anemia only insofar as unchanged chloramphenicol or metabolites capable of being retransformed to it are present; the persistent, covalently bound residues occurring in animals and eventually in foods of animal origin are insignificant in this respect.
