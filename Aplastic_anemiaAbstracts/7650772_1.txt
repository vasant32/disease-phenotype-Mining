Herbal medication use is common in many cultural groups. Because these products are unregulated, the potential for significant toxicity exists. We report a case of aplastic anemia associated with the use of an herbal medication by a 12-year-old boy. On analysis, the herbal medication was found to contain phenylbutazone, which has been strongly associated with the production of similar hematologic abnormalities. The medication was not listed as an ingredient and no warning was present on the box.
