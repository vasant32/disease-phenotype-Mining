This retrospective study compared the outcomes in 32 adult patients with hematologic diseases (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, severe aplastic anemia) who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT, n = 14; median age, 28 years) or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT, n = 18; median age, 29 years) from human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling donors. Median follow-up was 58 months in BMT recipients and 18 months in PBSCT recipients. Neutrophil (median, Day 8 vs Day 13, p < 0.001) and platelet engraftment (median, Day 9 vs Day 17, p < 0.001) was faster in the PBSCT group than in the BMT group. Patients receiving PBSCT required less platelet transfusion than those receiving BMT (median, 54 units vs 144 units, p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in red cell transfusion. At 100 days, there was no difference in the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (42.9% vs 33.3%, p = 0.72) or grade II-IV acute GVHD (14.3% vs 5.6%, p = 0.57), and there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (20% vs 33.3%, p = 0.67). No chronic GVHD was noted in any relapsed patients (BMT, 5; PBSCT, 3), and no patients with chronic GVHD during follow-up had a relapse. Relapse was the most frequent cause of death inboth groups (BMT, 5/9, 55.6%; PBSCT, 3/4, 75%; p = 0.25); all relapses occurred within 1 year after transplantation. Overall survival was significantly better in the PBSCT group (35.7% vs 77.8%, p = 0.029), but this difference was lost if only hematologic malignancies were analyzed (30.8% vs 63.6%, p = 0.20). Our results are similar to those reported previously, with faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment and less severe acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD with PBSCT. Allogeneic PBSCT is a feasible and beneficial alternative to allogeneic BMT in adult hematologic disease.
