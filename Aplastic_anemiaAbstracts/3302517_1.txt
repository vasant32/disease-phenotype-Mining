A 22-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia was treated with antilymphocyte globulin, prednisone, and oxymetholone. Fourteen days after initiation of treatment he developed a fulminant mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema leading to respiratory failure refractory to mechanical ventilation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed nodular lesions typical of aspergillus. Cultures of bronchial mucus revealed Aspergillus fumigatus as the responsible pathogen.
