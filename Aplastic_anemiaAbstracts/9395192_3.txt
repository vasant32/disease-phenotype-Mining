We report a case of severe gastro-intestinal (G-I) graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) successfully treated with intra-mesenteric artery steroid administration. A 29-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) was submitted to HLA-identical unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and was found to be suffering from grade IV G-I GVHD. Although cyclosporine, steroid pulse therapy, and FK506 proved ineffective, 30 mg of water-soluble prednisolone as administered into each the superior and inferior mesenteric artery with remarkable effects. This treatment was repeated two times, and the symptoms of G-I GVHD disappeared completely.
