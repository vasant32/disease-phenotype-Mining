Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) provides effective therapy for many patients with aplastic anemia, and its mechanism of action has been presumed to be secondary to lymphocytotoxicity. However, our studies of lymphocyte function in aplastic anemia show marked abnormalities of lymphokine production, which ATG may modulate. In 12 of 17 patients with aplastic anemia, interleukin 2 (IL2) production was markedly elevated in vitro (P less than .01 by paired statistical analysis). Expression of the IL2 receptor, or Tac antigen, on peripheral lymphocytes assessed by flow microfluorometry was also increased above the normal range in 11 of 15 cases. Studies of ATG suggested that it might act to stimulate lymphocyte function. In vitro, ATG is a mitogen, as measured by incorporation of 3H-thymidine into blood mononuclear cells; the response of cells to ATG from patients with aplastic anemia was exaggerated in comparison with normals. Cell proliferation was accompanied by production of IL2 to levels that were, in some cases, similar to those obtained with lectin stimulation. Finally, supernatants from lymphocytes cultured in the presence of ATG were able to replace adherent cells in providing growth factors for the support of nonadherent cells in methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assays. These results provide a mechanism for an "immunostimulatory" action of ATG in effecting hematopoietic response in some patients with aplastic anemia.
