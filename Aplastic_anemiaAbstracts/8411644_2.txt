Blood erythropoietin (EPO) concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay in 513 patients with various diseases. Untreated polycythemia vera showed lower EPO concentration than normal. Aplastic anemia (AA) revealed the highest EPO level among all anemic diseases in relation to hematocrit value. EPO level of AA patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation was as low as normal subjects even when the anemia has not fully recovered. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) showed unusually high EPO concentration among hemolytic anemias. In normal subjects, blood EPO concentration showed a diurnal rhythm that was higher at night than during the daytime. These findings suggest the diagnostic usefulness of measurement of EPO in blood diseases.
