A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to quantitate biologically active gamma interferon (INF-gamma) in sera and in supernatants of cultured mononuclear cells obtained from 50 patients with aplastic anemia. Only five of the 50 serum samples had INF-gamma levels above background (greater than 0 less than 0.5 units per mL). Detectable levels of spontaneous INF-gamma (0.3 to 868 U/mL) were found in 18 of the 50 mononuclear cell supernatants tested. The addition of patient sera or INF-gamma positive supernatants to cultures of normal hematopoietic colonies did not result in reduced colony growth. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis of mononuclear cells failed to establish a correlation between the presence of INF-gamma in supernatants and the number of activated T cells or natural killer (NK) cells in the mononuclear cell population. However, a significant correlation did exist between the presence of monocytes and the production of INF-gamma. Contrary to previous reports, our data suggest that patients with aplastic anemia do not have high circulating levels of INF-gamma. Unstimulated mononuclear cells from some patients will produce significant levels of INF-gamma, but this does not result in decreased in vitro hematopoiesis.
