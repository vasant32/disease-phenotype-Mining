 BACKGROUND: Fanconi's anemia (FA) is a rare recessive genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental and congenital abnormalities, which frequently evolves to aplastic anemia and neoplasias, primarily acute leukemia and head-neck carcinomas. Risk of malignancies increases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in FA carcinogenesis have been proposed. OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence of oral HPV in FA patients without oral malignant lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After oral examination, 76 subjects without detectable oral malignant lesions were included and classified in four groups: 20 FA submitted to HSCT (I), 22 FA not submitted to HSCT (II), 18 severe aplastic anemia (SAA) submitted to HSCT (III) and 16 healthy subjects (IV). Liquid-based cytology sampling, HPV screening by polymerase chain reaction and genotyping by reverse hybridization were performed. RESULTS: The HPV detection rates were: group I 35%, group II 27.3%, group III 38% and group IV 6.25%. Prevalence of high risk HPV types, mainly HPV16, was detected. Compared with control group, suggestions for increased likelihood of being HPV infected in SAA (OR = 9.55, 95% CI: 1.01-125.41) and FA patients submitted to HSCT (OR = 8.08, 0.83-72.29) emerged. CONCLUSION: Patients without oral malignant lesions submitted to HSCT, have high prevalence of oral HPV. HPV screening and close follow up should be considered in these patients.
