A 53-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia developed sporadic Vibrio vulnificus septicemia 1 day after eating raw fish and shellfish. Although V. vulnificus infection is potentially fatal, he was saved by immediate and sensitive antibiotic administration. Patients with chronic hematologic disease are susceptible to infection by this organism and are prone to developing septicemia when they eat raw seafood. It is necessary for a patient with this infection to be given effective antibiotics as quickly as possible.
