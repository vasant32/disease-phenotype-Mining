We analyzed the occurrence, clinical and physical features, laboratory findings, diagnostic criteria, reaction to therapy and prognosis of 15 cases Penecilliosis marneffei. Four were localized infection on skin, eleven were systemic infection, all cases were found in Guangdong province of China. We found that males were predominant in infection compared with females in 15 patients, and all patients observed had different occupations. The patients with AIDS as underlying disease were commonly drivers or unemployed. Thirteen of 15 patients had underlying diseases, i.e., connective tissue disease, aplastic anemia, kidney transplant, AIDS. Clinical features showed different symptoms, including weight loss, high fever, skin lesions, and respiratory system symptoms. Seven of 15 patients received antifungal therapy, the remaining eight patients did not receive therapy for different reasons. Nine of the patients died five recovered. Fifteen isolates were cultured from skin lesions, blood, bone marrow, peritoneum dialysis and pleural effusion and were confirmed to be Penicillium marneffei by morphology, thermal dimorphism, pathology and DNA sequence analysis. This report indicates that Penicillium marneffei may exist in nature in Guangdong province of SE China.
