A patient with aplastic anemia was immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and transplanted with allogenic bone marrow. While lacking demonstrable T-cell activity posttransplantation, he developed a generalized macular erythematous eruption and fever, clinically attributed to intranasal polymyxin B. A specific IgE antibody, demonstrated by direct skin testing, Prausnitz-Kustner passive transfer, and indirect passive hemagglutination was temporally related to the reaction. Discontinuation of the drug led to prompt defervescence and resolution of the drug eruption.
