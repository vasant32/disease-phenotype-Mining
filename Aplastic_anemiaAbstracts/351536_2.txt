Bone marrow transplantation is a relatively new and aggressive procedure that is being used in the treatment of leukemia and aplastic anemia. We observed approximately 30 children and their families at the UCLA Medical Center throughout the procedure. Various psychological responses during the treatment are outlined. Eleven stages are identified, including the patient's and family's first awareness of this procedure, the preadmission evaluation and psychosocial assessment, the introduction into isolation, the donor's hospitalization, the transplantation itself, and the various reactions and interactions of the patient, family, and staff throughout these stages.
