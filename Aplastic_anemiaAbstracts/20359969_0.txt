The inherited aplastic anaemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, frequent association with one or more somatic anomalies and increased risk of cancer. They are rare disorders, usually diagnosed at paediatric age, and have significant premature mortality. The authors report 11 cases of inherited aplastic anaemias, 8 of Fanconi's anaemia and 3 of Dyskeratosis congenita. These cases were diagnosed in the last 14 years in the Dona Estef√¢nia Hospital.
