Sonography of the liver, gallbladder, portal and splenic veins, biochemical hepatic tests were conducted in 35 patients with aplastic anemia (AA). The patients were ill from 3 months to 20 years. Depending on AA, duration some patients displayed a small enlargement of the liver, changes in its echo structure, increased calibre of the portal veins. Moderate hepatomegaly was associated with biochemical shifts reflecting dysfunction of hepatic tissue. The above sonographic and biochemical changes observed usually in toxic hepatitis result from different chemical compounds produced within AA genesis, from administration of anabolic hormones and other drugs, frequent transfusion of red cells and other blood components. The size of the spleen was not changed, though its echo pattern was abnormal.
