Mice with immune-induced aplastic anemia (AA) were given 5 mg ligustrazine intraperitoneally twice a day. On the 14th day, the expression of CD49d, CD49c, cyclinD2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) was examined by flow cytometry, and VCAM-1 on stromal cells was immunohistochemically measured by Strept Avidin-Biotin Complex (SABC). The expression of CD49d, CD49c, VCAM-1 and cyclinD2 in ligustrazine-treated group was significantly higher than that in AA group (P < 0.01), but the ratio of G0 + G1 phase cells was significantly lower than that in AA group (P < 0.01). The results showed that ligustrazine could improve the expression of adherent molecule and cyclin D2 in the bone marrow of mice with immune-induced aplastic anemia, thereby promoting the growth of hematopoietic cells.
