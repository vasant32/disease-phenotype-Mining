Parvovirus B19 is a common human pathogen which can cause severe syndromes, including aplastic anemia and fetal hydrops. The mapping of the first parvovirus B19-derived CD8(+) T-lymphocyte epitope is described. This HLA-B35-restricted peptide derives from the nonstructural (NS1) protein and is strongly immunogenic in B19 virus-seropositive donors.
