A case of multiple small well-differentiated hepatomas with early peliosis hepatis, multiple pancreatic islet cell tumors, and a renal medullary interstitial cell tumor following five years of androgen and prednisone therapy for idiopathic aplastic anemia is reported in a patient who died shortly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The hepatic tumors were well differentiated, and the pancreatic tumors were of mixed ribbon and islet cell pattern. Therapeutic and experimental implications and the relevant literature are briefly summarized.
