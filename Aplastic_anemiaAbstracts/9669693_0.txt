We report the successful treatment of pancytopenia with G-CSF and high dose erythropoietin (Epo) in an elderly patient diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA). Furthermore this effect is dose dependent for Epo in vivo. Detection of apoptosis by gel electrophoresis shows that high dose Epo protects bone marrow mononuclear cells from spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. These findings may explain some of the mechanisms of aplastic anemia.
