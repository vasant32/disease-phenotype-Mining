Eight patients with idiopathic severe aplastic anemia received acyclovir as the initial treatment to ascertain if this antiviral therapy could be effective. Three patients showed improvement, but only one had a sustained recovery. The responses could be coincidental, but it seems that some patients can benefit from acyclovir. More studies are needed on the role of viruses and antiviral therapy in relation to severe aplastic anemia.
