Aplastic anemia is a rare complication after liver transplantation. Its incidence has been estimated to be 0.007%. Aplastic anemia was observed in 23.2 33% of patients who underwent liver transplantation for fulminant non-A-E viral hepatitis. In this paper, we describe a child suffering from aplastic anemia who eventually died from sepsis after liver transplantation for non-A-E fulminant hepatic failure.
