A 47-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of severe anemia and polyclonal gammopathy. She developed sicca syndrome after admission. Laboratory data revealed pancytopenia (white blood cells, 2,800/microliter; hemoglobin, 6.4 g/dl; platelets, 6.1 x 10(4)/microliter) and hyper gamma globulinemia (5.2 g/dl), and bone marrow was hypoplastic. Histology of the salivary gland showed infiltration of lymphocytes. We report a good response to immunosuppressive therapy in a rare case of aplastic anemia complicating Sj√∂gren's syndrome.
