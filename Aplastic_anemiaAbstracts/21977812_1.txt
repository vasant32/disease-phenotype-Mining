 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Busui Shengxue Granule ((see text) Herbal granule for replenishing marrow to produce blood) on chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) patients' integrin alpha 6 (VLA-6/CD49f) and laminin (Ln). METHODS: Sixty-five patients were divided into experimental group and control group through random number table. There were 34 patients, 17 were male and 17 female, aged 2-67, with a medianage of 30.2 +/- 8.6, in the experimental group, including 17 patients of kidney-yin deficiency and 17 of kidney-yang deficiency, treated by Busui Shengxue Granule. There were 31 patients in the control group, 16 were male and 15 female, aged 4-65, with a medianage of 31.2 +/- 8.0; administered Zaizhang Shengxue Tablet (see text) Herbal tablet for chronic aplastic anemia). Both groups were treated for six months and compared with 10 normal persons after the treatment. Flow cytometry was adopted to detect the change in the expression of VLA-6/CD49f, receptor in mononuclear cells of CAA patients and normal persons. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to detect the expression of peripheral serum Ln. RESULTS: CAA patients' VLA-6/CD49f was in the state of low expression and Ln in the state of high expression. After the treatment, both VLA-6/CD49f and Ln were regulated to some extent and the change in the experimental group was better than that of the control group. Compared with the kidney-yin deficiency patients, those indices of kidney-yang deficiency patients were easier to correct. CONCLUSION: The VLA-6/CD49f and Ln expressions of CAA patients are abnormal. The treatment with Busui Shengxue Granule makes both of them improved.
