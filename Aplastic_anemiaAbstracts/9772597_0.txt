Forty-eight cases of aplastic anemia (AA) were divided into two groups: the treated group (30 cases) were treated with Chinese herbal medicine and cord blood infusion, the control group (18 cases) were treated with cord blood infusion solely. The total effective rate in the treated group and the control group was 93.3% and 72.2% respectively, the difference between two groups was significant (P < 0.05). Cultures of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) in vitro were measured also in both groups. Results showed that 3 months after treatment, the elevation of CFU-GM in the two groups were similar to each other, but after 6 months' treatment, level of CFU-GM in treated group elevated persistently and steadily, while in control group, it decreased slightly as compared with level at 3 months' treatment, suggesting the recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis of treated group was more stable than that of control group. This study indicated that combined treatment of Chinese herbal medicine and cord blood infusion is an effective method in treating AA.
