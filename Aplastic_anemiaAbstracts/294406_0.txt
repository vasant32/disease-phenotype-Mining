Relations between clinical course and change in aldolase (ALD) isoenzyme pattern were investigated on the peripheral and bone marrow blood of normal subjects and patients suffering from leukemia, multiple myeloma, hypoplastic anemia and other hematological disorders. Similar examination was performed on human leukemia cells and on sera and leukocytes from Donryu rats inoculated with rat leukemia cells (DBLA-6), induced by NBU. In addition to the enzyme activity, isoenzyme pattern was analyzed electrophoretically. The results obtained were as follows: 1) FDP/F1P ratios of the peripheral and marrow blood were high in untreated leukemia. After the induction therapy, the ratio in the marrow blood was high, but decreased in peripheral blood. 2) In complete remission, both ratios were decreased to normal level. 3) In the early relapse of leukemia, the marrow blood showed a high ratio in spite of normal value in the peripheral blood. During full relapse or reinduction therapy, FDP/F1P ratio remained high in both the peripheral and marrow blood. 4) Atypical hypoplastic leukemia showed a significantly high ratio in the marrow, but a low ratio in the periphery. No difference in either ratio was detected between hypoplastic anemia and normal subjects. 5) Zymogram of leukemia cells from leukemia patients showed that ALD-A was predominant more clearly than in normal leukocytes. ALD in normal leukocytes was composed mainly of ALD-A and its hybrids with ALD-B and ALD-C. 6) The ratio in sera and leukocytes from rats inoculated with DBLA-6 cells was increased with exacerbation of leukemia. ALD-A was predominant in rat leukemia cells on the zymogram. It is concluded that aldolase isoenzymes, especially the FDP/F1P ratio, are useful in estimating clinical course of leukemia, particularly in deciding early relapse of leukemia in bone marrow. These laboratory findings are also useful in differentiating atypical leukemia from hypoplastic anemia.
