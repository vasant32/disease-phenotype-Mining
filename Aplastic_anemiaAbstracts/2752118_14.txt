Among 354 adult patients with either hematological malignancy or aplastic anemia, eight were positive for anti-HTLV-I antibodies; six of eight had received multiple transfusions. There was an approximately 3.5-fold increase (P less than .001) of HTLV-I seropositivity in the patients with hematologic disease (8 of 354, 2.23%) compared to the healthy adults older than 20 years (34 of 5252, .65%). Two hematological patients, one with Hodgkin's disease and one with acute promyelocytic leukemia, were found to be positive for HTLV-I, and developed and died of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) subsequently. Both were long-term survivors of the primary disease and had received multiple transfusions. The latent period from blood transfusion to onset of ATL was 6 months and 11 years, respectively. Immunocompromised patients, who were seropositive for HTLV-I, may be at increased risk for ATL compared to healthy carriers of HTLV-I, and the latent period may be shorter.
