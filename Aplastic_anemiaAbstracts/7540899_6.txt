Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves conditioning with cyclophosphamide and, for patients with malignant disease, total body irradiation (TBI). This study describes the neuropsychological development of 10 children treated for leukemia (n = 7), neuroblastoma (n = 1) or severe aplastic anemia (SAA; n = 2) at 3 years of age or younger. A moderate general developmental delay, with pronounced motor deficits and varying degrees of perceptual and cognitive problems, was observed in all children treated for malignant disease. Children treated for SAA had normal development. We conclude that BMT, including TBI, can be directly associated with long-term neuropsychological impairment in children treated at a very young age. Continued medical and psychological follow-up procedures are needed.
