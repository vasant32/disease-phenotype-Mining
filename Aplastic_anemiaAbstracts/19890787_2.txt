Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) has become the accepted salvage treatment for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) lacking a matched sibling donor and failing immunosuppressive treatment. However, non-engraftment and early rejection remain main reasons for treatment related morbidity and mortality. We report on three adolescents who were grafted from MUD, rejected their graft and were re-grafted 47-51 days after first HSCT from the same donor. For conditioning, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, ATG and/or OKT3 in combination with total lymphoid irradiation was used. Unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells at a minimum dose of 8 x 10(6)/kg CD34+cells were infused. Acute toxicity was low. Two patients are alive and well for more than 3 years, one patient developed extended chronic graft-versus-host disease from which he died 34 months after second HSCT. Re-transplantation from MUD in the case of non-engraftment or rejection from the same donor is possible following immunoablation combined with intensive serotherapy in young patients with SAA.
