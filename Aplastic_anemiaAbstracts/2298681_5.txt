Records of 8 dogs with drug-associated aplastic anemia were reviewed. Drugs suspected as being causative included estradiol cyclopentylpropionate (3 dogs), phenylbutazone (2 dogs), meclofenamic acid (1 dog), trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and fenbendazole (1 dog), and quinidine (1 dog). Five of the dogs died or were euthanatized. One dog with estrogen-associated aplasia recovered after prolonged treatment. The dogs with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine and quinidine-associated marrow aplasia recovered promptly after treatment was discontinued.
