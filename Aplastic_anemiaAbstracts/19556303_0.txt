Antibodies specific to moesin, which are frequently detectable in the serum of patients with aplastic anemia (AA), can induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion from monocytes and a human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for TNF-alpha secretion from monocytic cells induced by the auto-antibodies that are purified from the sera of AA patients. TNF-alpha induction by anti-moesin antibodies depended on the amount of cell surface moesin expressed by THP-1 cells. F(ab')(2) fragments prepared from the anti-moesin antibodies were able to stimulate THP-1 cells to secrete TNF-alpha and this stimulatory effect was enhanced by cross-linking of moesins with anti-human IgG F(ab')(2) fragment antibodies. Anti-moesin antibodies as well as their F(ab')(2) fragments induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in monocytic cells and this effect was suppressed by the addition of an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Moreover, anti-moesin antibody treatment induced the phosphorylation of moesin proteins in the monocytes and THP-1 cells within 30 min. These results indicate that anti-moesin antibodies induce TNF-alpha secretion from monocytes through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway provoked by direct binding to moesin on the cells.
