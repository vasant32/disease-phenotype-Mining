We assessed pulmonary function and exercise tolerance in 10 BMT patients. Their underlying disorders were as follows; chronic myeloid leukemia 5 cases, acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2 cases, aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma one case each. Their mean age was 26 +/- 9 years old. When the patients were healthy and free of serious complications and anemia, arterial blood gas examination, pulmonary function tests and incremental treadmill exercise test were examined repeatedly. Although %VC and FEV1.0% kept within normal range, PaO2 at rest, %DLCO, VO2max, VO2max/kg and O2-pulsemax remained low at one year after BMT. There were significant correlations between VO2max and O2-pulsemax [r = 0.955 (p < 0.001)], %VC [r = 0.758 (p < 0.02)], VE/VO2max [r = -0.749 (p < 0.02)] and delta SaO2/VO2/kg [r = -0.731 (p < 0.02)], suggesting that exercise intolerance in BMT patients may be based on both cardiac and gas exchange abnormalities. To evaluate cardiac dysfunction, we compared exercise parameters obtained at an exercise level of 75% predicted heart rate max in five age-matched normal subjects to those in six BMT patients who did not demonstrate desaturation during exercise. As a result, the mean values of VO2max/kg and O2-pulse/m2 in BMT patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects, suggesting that cardiac dysfunction may be due to insufficiency of stroke volume during exercise. It is concluded that exercise intolerance in BMT patients may be mainly due to cardiac dysfunction.
