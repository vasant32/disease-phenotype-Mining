Carbamazepine is a well-established, effective treatment of complex partial seizures and is well tolerated in most patients. The adverse effects of carbamazepine include aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and peripheral edema. Hypertension or hypotension has also rarely been documented in patients with either therapeutic or toxic blood levels of carbamazepine. It is possible that carbamazepine-induced hypertension in those with therapeutic blood levels is rarely seen because most of the patients who begin treatment are young and do not have baseline hypertension. The authors describe a patient of African-American descent with a history of controlled essential hypertension who developed severe uncontrolled hypertension when started on carbamazepine. Treatment with additional antihypertensive medications did not reduce his blood pressure. In addition, he developed two episodes of transient neurologic deficits, the symptoms of which consisted of dysarthria, vertigo, and unstable gait. A substantial reduction of his carbamazepine dose resulted in the control of his blood pressure and no recurrence of his symptoms.
