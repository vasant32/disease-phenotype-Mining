We have analysed the contribution to megakaryocyte colony formation in methylcellulose made by human plasma, serum, media conditioned by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated leukocytes (PHA-LCM), erythropoietin (EPO) preparations, and platelets. The culture system was used as a bioassay for megakaryocyte colony stimulating activity (Meg-CSA) in plasma samples of patients with perturbed megakaryocytopoiesis. Preparations of heparinized platelet-poor plasma yielded the most consistent results. Platelet-poor plasma of normal subjects will at best facilitate the occasional growth of small megakaryocyte colonies. Colony frequency and size are reproducibly enhanced in the presence of PHA-LCM as a source of exogenous Meg-CSA. Commercially available EPO preparations may vary in their content of activities that influence megakaryocyte colony formation. Addition of these preparations to cultures that contain plasma and PHA-LCM usually does not enhance colony formation. In contrast to platelet-poor plasma, platelet rich plasma and serum are less supportive of megakaryocyte colony growth. It is suggested that this loss of activity may be related to the release of inhibitors by activated platelets or alternatively caused by absorption of activities by platelets. Plasma samples from patients with megakaryocytopoietic dysfunction may contain components that promote colony formation without addition of PHA-LCM or EPO. This phenomenon is consistently observed for patients with severe aplastic anemia and bone marrow transplant recipients after completion of their ablative preparative regimen.
