OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vivo effect of hemin on erythroid progenitor of the normal and aplastic anemia mice. METHODS: BFU-E and CFU-E of normal and aplastic anemia(AA) mice were assayed at different time (6 h, 12 h and 24 h) after hemin injection on a dosage of 6.50 micrograms/g body weight, and at 6 h after injection of different doses of hemin (0.65 microgram/g, 6.50 micrograms/g and 13.00 micrograms/g body weight). RESULTS: The yields of BFU-E and CFU-E from AA mice were reduced compared with that from normal mice. At 6 h after hemin injection (6.50 micrograms/g b.w.), the yields of BFU-E and CFU-E from AA mice were increased from 3 +/- 2/femur and 12 +/- 3/femur to 10 +/- 2/femur (P < 0.01) and 39 +/- 12/femur (P < 0.01), respectively, and so did the case for normal mice (for BFU-E, from 1,056 +/- 160/femur to 3,410 +/- 708/femur, P < 0.01, and for CFU-E, from 12 +/- 3/five 200x fields to 38 +/- 3/five 200x fields, P < 0.01). Low dose of hemin had no inductive effect. CONCLUSION: Hemin is a in vivo inducer of erythroid progenitors both in normal and AA mice.
