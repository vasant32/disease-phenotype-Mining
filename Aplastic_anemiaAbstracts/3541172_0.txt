A male patient with severe aplastic anemia who had rejected a first T cell depleted graft from his HLA-identical sister was retransplanted from the same donor without T cell depletion and using an intensified conditioning regimen. After 8 weeks acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained. After in vitro restimulation and following limiting dilution cloning, 15 proliferative (PLT) and 25 cytolytic (CTL) T cell lines specific for host PBMC but unreactive to donor PBMC were isolated. Only 1 of 10 clones which could be expanded sufficiently for testing recognized a target cell (haploidentical sister), and in only 4 instances could a restriction element be found in a panel study (3 times HLA-A2; once HLA-BW49) of 13 unrelated stimulators. Of the 8 CTL clones testable after expansion, none showed a clear restriction and none recognized any of the family cells. Our data demonstrate that anti-patient reactive PLT and CTL lines can be found in PBMC. In no instance was segregation with HLA found. Only HLA-class I restriction was detectable.
