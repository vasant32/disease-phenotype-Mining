OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine (TCM-WM) therapy on chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: The RBC life span of 30 normal human subjects and 30 patients with CAA were measured by 51Cr labelled technique before and after TCM-WM therapy. The morphology and distribution of RBC membrane protein granules were observed by freeze fracture etching and transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The half life of erythrocytes (RBC T1/2) was shortened in CAA cases and there was a significant difference compared to healthy control (P < 0.01). After therapy, the RBC life span prolonged and approached the normal level. Before treatment, there existed abnormal in morphology, decrease in amount and uneven in distribution of protein granules in protoplasmic face (PF) and extracellular face (EF) of RBC membrane. After treatment, the protein granules of RBC membrane was improved and approached to control. CONCLUSIONS: The morphology, amount, quality and distribution of RBC membrane protein granule were closely related to its life span. The therapeutic effect of TCM-WM was better than that of WM alone and it had a function both in stabilizing membrane protein and extending the RBC life span.
