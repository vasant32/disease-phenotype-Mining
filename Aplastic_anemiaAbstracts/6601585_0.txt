To investigate the pathogenetic significance of peripheral blood adherent cells in aplastic anemia, the inhibitory effects of adherent cells obtained from the peripheral blood of 10 patients with aplastic anemia on the growth of CFUE and CFUC were compared with those of normal controls. The inhibitory effects of adherent cells were studied by means of co-culture with normal allogeneic bone marrow cells. The suppression of these inhibitory effects was also examined by adding indomethacin to the co-culture system. In addition, PGE2 concentrations in the adherent cell-conditioned media were assayed. The inhibition of the colony growth by peripheral blood adherent cells from the aplastic anemia patients was not significantly different from controls. Both the suppression of the inhibitory effects by indomethacin and the level of PGE2 production showed no significant difference between the patients and controls.
