A case-control interview study of aplastic anemia was conducted to evaluate suspected risk factors. Cases (N = 59) newly diagnosed during 1975-82 at 25 Baltimore area hospitals were compared with 59 individually matched (on age, sex and race) controls selected by random digit dialing. The average educational level was less for cases than controls. The major job-related findings were a significant excess for occupational exposure to paint (OR = 6.1; 95% C.I. = 1.2-29.7), further substantiated by a positive dose-response relationship, although painters were not at excess risk. An increased risk of occupational exposure to viruses (OR = 9.0; 95% C.I. = 0.8-105.6) was noted. Additional evidence implicating viral factors included a significant association with prior history of hepatitis (OR = 9.0; 95% C.I. = 1.0, 84.2) and an elevated risk for pre-diagnostic receipt of blood transfusions (OR = 7.1; 95% C.I. = 0.7-68.4). Risks were not increased for other occupational, residential, personal, or medical treatment exposures or for other viral infections, medical conditions, smoking or alcohol consumption prior to diagnosis. Because of the small number of subjects studied and the multiple comparisons examined, these findings should be interpreted cautiously and confirmation should be undertaken in larger, population-based studies.
