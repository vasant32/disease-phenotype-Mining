 BACKGROUND: Platelet Rich Plasma-Platelet concentrate (PRP-PC), Buffy Coat poor-platelet concentrate (BCPC), and Apheresis - PC were prepared and their therapeutic efficacy were assessed in thrombocytopenic patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PRP-PC and BC-PC were prepared from whole blood and Apheresis-PC by automated cell separator. The post transfusion efficacy of transfused platelets was assessed at 1 hour and 20 hours by corrected count increment (CCI) and percentage recovery (PR). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients' (20 each for PRP-PC, BC-PC and Apheresis-PC) were enrolled in this study. Forty one patients received therapeutic and nineteen received prophylactic transfusion support. Patients with aplastic anemia 43% (25/60) and acute leukemia 38% (23/60) formed a majority of study population. Platelet dosage of patients' received PRP-PC, BC-PC and apheresis-PC were 2.4±0.82 × 1011 (mean±SD), 2.2±0.83 × 1011 (mean±SD) and 4.14±1.82 × 1011 (mean±SD) and ranged from 1.16-4.11 × 1011, 1.04-4.20 × 1011 and 1.22-8.90 × 1011 respectively. There was significantly increase in inter-transfusion interval with Apheresis-PC than with PRP-PC and BC-PC recipients [(Mean±S.D.), 4.7±1.33 days Vs 2.7±0.82 days Vs 2.5±0.7 days respectively] (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients transfused with apheresis-PC had received higher platelet dosage than PRP-PC and BC-PC and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The post transfusion platelet counts and increments at 1 hour and 20 hours were significantly higher with apheresis-PC than PRP-PC and BC-PC (p < 0.001). However, the corrected count increment (CCI) and percentage recovery (PR) in all three groups were comparable. There was significantly increase in inter-transfusion interval with apheresis-PC than PRPPC and BC-PC (p < 0.05).
