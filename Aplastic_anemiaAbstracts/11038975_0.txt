The content of cytochrome oxidase (CCO), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) in bone marrow cells in 68 cases of aplastic anemia before and after treatment was determined by computerized graphical analysis and compared with that of normal volunteers (control group). The significantly lowered CCO and SDH levels and the markedly increased NAP content before treatment (P < 0.01) became approximately normal after that of supplementing the kidney and removing blood stasis (P > 0.05).
