Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) is a serious, but rare infectious complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We describe a case of fatal sepsis due to MT and Aspergillus flavus after allogeneic BMT for Aplastic Anemia. The diagnosis was made on bone marrow biopsy and asitic fluid culture. Broadspectrum antituberculous and Amphotericin B therapy was started immediately after diagnosis. The patient developed severe hypoxia and finally died of multi-organ failure. Rapid progression of mycobacterial infection as well as fungal infection should be considered in patients post BMT with unexplained fever, particularly in patients from endemic areas.
