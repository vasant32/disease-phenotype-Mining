Two women suffering from severe aplastic anemia were treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). They became pregnant 17 and 40 months after the procedure. During the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, one of them continued to receive cyclosporin A (CSA) to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Her CSA serum levels during these first 4 months ranged from 35 to 280 ng/ml. The course of pregnancy was uneventful and a healthy boy was delivered at term by Cesarean section. The other patient was shown to have rejected the transplanted marrow 4 months after BMT; autologous regeneration had occurred. During the last 2 months of her pregnancy, the hemoglobin and platelet numbers decreased again. Nevertheless, a healthy girl was delivered at term. Three months after delivery this patient's hematologic parameters are almost back to normal.
