A young husband and wife couple presented simultaneously with aplastic anemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia, respectively. No etiologic agent or exposure was identified. With appropriate therapy, the wife achieved a complete remission and the husband has had a good response. Potential etiologic environmental factors known to cause both disorders are discussed. A single causative agent may induce stem-cell changes in genetically dissimilar persons and produce a spectrum of pathologic features ranging from aplastic anemia to acute leukemia.
