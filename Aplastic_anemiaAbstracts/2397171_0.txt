Five children with aplastic anemia (AA) were treated with Cyclosporine A (CyA) after failure or poor response to other immunosuppressive agents. A complete remission was achieved in 3 patients, a good partial response in 1, and a poor partial response in another. In 1 patient in whom a complete remission was obtained, a relapse occurred 4 months after CyA was stopped. The treatment was resumed and a complete remission was again observed. Four patients were still on treatment, and side effects were mild. CyA appeared to be an effective treatment in AA.
