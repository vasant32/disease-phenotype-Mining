This study reviews results of fetal liver transplantation in hematologic disorders including aplastic anemia, leukemia and thalassemia. One hundred and twenty two patients received transplants for aplastic anemia; engraftment was reported in 4 patients; graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) did not occur. Complete and partial responses were reported in one-half of patients, the majority of whom had no evidence of engraftment. Thirty-nine patients received transplants for leukemia. Transient engraftment was reported in 40% and two developed GvHD; survival extended to more than 2 years. The higher rate of engraftment in patients with leukemia suggests a role of pretransplant immune suppression. The risk of GvHD appears to be low despite complete HLA-mismatching. These data suggest a possible role for fetal liver transplantation in man. Future studies should probably be based on preclinical data obtained in large animal models.
