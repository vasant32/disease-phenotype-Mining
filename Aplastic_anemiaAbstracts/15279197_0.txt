We studied clinical features of immunosuppressive (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) associated encephalopathy in bone marrow transplant patients. 378 cases of allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients over fifteen years old of chronic and acute leukemia (CML, ANLL, ALL) (n = 311), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 42) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA) (n = 25) were investigated. Immunosuppressive associated encephalopathy occurred in 12 cases. The rate of incidence was significantly higher in SAA and MDS (7 cases) than in leukemia. The cases which showed typical radiological abnormality in MRI were limited in SAA and hypoplastic MDS. 10 cases died, which revealed worse than an overall survival rate of recipients without immunosupressive-associated encephalopathy. 5 of 7 cases in SAA and MDS had taken cyclosporine as treatment of the disease before bone marrow transplantation and that might influence the incidence of encephalopathy.
