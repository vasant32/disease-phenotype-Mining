A 5-year-old boy with a peculiar type of post-encephalitic/encephalopathic epilepsy is reported. He had been healthy showing normal development before its onset. Five days after the onset of an upper respiratory infection, he had a severe generalized seizure, that evolved into intractable seizures. They were highly resistant to almost all anticonvulsants and occasionally resulted in status epilepticus. High-dose phenobarbital therapy successfully controlled the convulsions, but was discontinued because of drug-induced aplastic anemia. Alternative bromide therapy was markedly effective in controlling the seizures.
