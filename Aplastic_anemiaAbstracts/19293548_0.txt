A 66-year-old woman complained of fever, sore throat, and neck pain due to pharyngitis and painful lymph node swelling. CBC revealed severe pancytopenia and markedly hypocellular marrow. The administration of antibiotics and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) successfully ameliorated the inflammatory lesions, and hematopoiesis recovered. Causes for pancytopnenia was unlikely to be virus infection or drugs, and aplastic anemia was also unlikely since only the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was markedly elevated, erythropoietin (EPO) was slightly elevated, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was normal, and flow cytometric analysis for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells was negative. These results suggested that the cause of impaired hematopoiesis in the present patient might have been due to elevated TNF-alpha in overwhelming infection, although the pathogen was not identified.
