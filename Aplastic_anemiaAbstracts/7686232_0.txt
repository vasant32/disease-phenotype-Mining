We studied the effects of several cytokines on the development of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) progenitors using the serum-deprived culture. SCF plays an important role in the GM-CSF- or IL-3-dependent production of neutrophils and macrophages. In vitro colony assay also suggests an increase in sensitivity of GM progenitors to cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-3, G-CSF and/or SCF) in a patient with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia. A high level of serum IFN-gamma was associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in a patient with hemophagocytic syndrome. Based on the evidence that IFN-gamma significantly inhibited the proliferation of GM progenitors, IFN-gamma-mediated suppression was suggested as one of the mechanisms causing cytopenia. In patients with aplastic anemia and neutropenia, an increase of serum G-CSF levels was observed when neutrophils decreased remarkably in number. However, the serum SCF levels were constant in these patients. A failure of SCF to enhance colony growth in some patients with aplastic anemia implies qualitative abnormalities of hematopoietic progenitors.
