Subpopulations of rosette-forming cells were studied in lymphoid pools of peripheral blood and bone marrow of 24 children with acquired aplastic anemia, after a course of treatment with antilymphocytic globulin (ALG). After termination of the preparation transfusion a decrease in the levels of "active" T-lymphocytes and cells with C3-receptors was recorded. The levels of immature T-lymphocytes were found to be lowered four weeks after ALG-therapy, while other subpopulations remained within the normal. The lowering activity of immunogenesis in the bone marrow combined with hemopoietic recovery after the immunosuppressive therapy have evidenced a possible participation of immunologic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acquired aplastic anemia in children.
