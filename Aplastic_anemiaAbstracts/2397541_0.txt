84 cases observed were divided into 4 types according to principles of diagnosis and treatment based on an overall analysis of symptoms and signs, namely: Yang-deficiency of the Spleen and Kidney (62 cases, 73.8%), Yin-deficiency leads to internal heat (6 cases), deficiency of both the Heart and the Spleen (7 cases), and prostration of Qi after loss of blood (9 cases). The patients were treated with the method of warming and tonifying the Spleen and Kidney by using Er-Xian decoction of warming the Kidney. The three other types were also treated with the method after being relieved with the methods of tonifying the Heart and the Spleen, of nourishing Yin to relieve internal heat and cooling blood, and of strengthening Yang to stop chronic hemorrhage respectively so that function of the blood and Qi would promote each other and be improved. The total effective rate was 84.5%, and remission rate was 47.6% among 84 cases, but 91.9% and 50.0% in the type of Yang-deficiency of the Spleen and Kidney alone. Among the effective cases there was a remarkable improvement in the hemogram after treatment (P less than 0.001, less than 0.01), and the long-termed curative effect was also exciting. The mechanism of Er-Xian decoction of warming the Kidney was investigated through the nourishment of the hemopoiesis stem cell. The experiment showed that the decoction could increase CFU-S and GM-CFU in the bone marrow under the lower hemopoietic function of the bone marrow, and increase GM-CFU and CFU-E in the bone marrow of normal rats (P less than 0.001, less than 0.01, less than 0.05). The histological findings showed that there was a reduction in hemorrhage and hyperemia in the bone marrow between the decoction group and the control group, and the recovery of hemopoietic function was better than the latter.
