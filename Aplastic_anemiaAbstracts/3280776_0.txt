Bone marrow transplantation is an accepted form of treatment for aplastic anemia and end-stage hematological malignancies. Despite a satisfactory outcome in selected patients, more than one-half develop acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), characterized typically by involvement of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. We describe an unusual case in which a 10-year-old girl developed gastrointestinal symptoms as the only manifestation of GVHD. The patient presented with a rectovaginal fistula and had clinical, radiological, and histological features of gastrointestinal GVHD without evidence of liver or skin involvement.
