Several reports have noted pancytopenia associated with Human parvovirus B19 (PVB19) or Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in patients who have no history of immunodeficiency. To our knowledge, we report the first case of severe aplastic anemia associated with both EBV and PVB19 infections in a previously healthy 22-year-old man. He was admitted to our hematology service due to anemia and thrombocytopenia. He had no symptoms or signs of infections of these viruses. His bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypocellular marrow. Specific IgM and IgG antibodies to EBV and PVB19 were elevated. EBV and PVB19 virus genomes were detected by PCR in the bone marrow nucleated cells and the peripheral blood lymphocytes. Two months after treatment with prednisone, acyclovir, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), the genomes of both these viruses disappeared. However, his transfusion requirement for platelet suspensions and packed red blood cells persisted. The patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) and has had an enduring complete hematological response for 8 months.
