We present an unreported coexistence: eczema herpeticum (EH) with histopathological findings of herpetic folliculitis (HF) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A patient with atopic dermatitis (AD) underwent allogeneic BMT for idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia. She had been receiving cyclosporine (150 mg/12 h) and acyclovir (400 mg/12 h) for 6 months. A facial rash was observed, composed of monotonous erythematous, umbilicated papulo-vesicles and papulo-crusts <4 mm in size. The histopathological study showed herpetic cytopathic changes within the epidermis that extended into the hair follicle epithelium. Interestingly, microscopic HF has not previously been associated with post-transplant patients or EH. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the coexistence of these herpes simplex virus-related events may be underreported in the literature. Although further studies are necessary, we suggest that the prophylactic antiviral dose after BMT be enhanced in patients with underlying dermatologic diseases, especially in those with AD.
