Case report of a 7 year old girl, anaemic since birth. The anaemia, of variable intensity, is associated with a moderate reticulocytosis. Bone marrow films, show a marked erythroblastosis with conspicuous morphological abnormalities and internuclear chromatin bridges. The erythrocinetic pattern is that of ineffective erythropoiesis. The morphologic features are those of Heimpel and Wendt's type I congenital dyserythropoiesis. The erythrocytes are lysed by some acidified sera, thus showing a membrane anomaly which is unusual in type I. However the characteristics of the lysis are different from those of type II (HEMPAS) erythrocytes.
