Lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defence enzymes in lymphocytes and the content of cyclonucleotides in blood plasma were examined in children (3 groups) with aplastic anemia. The groups were formed depending on the disease stages in the examined. Disorders in the distribution of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, in the content of hydroperoxides and malonic aldehyde were discovered, with these disorders being diverse and dependent on the disease stage. The cAMP/cGMP in blood plasma was changed towards considerable rise of the cAMP level. During a remission, a majority of the characteristics did not return to normal.
