Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital anomalies, aplastic anemia, and a susceptibility to leukemia. There are at least 8 complementation groups (A through H). Extensive analyses of the FA group C gene FANCC in Western countries revealed that 10% to 15% of FA patients have mutations of this gene. The most common mutation is IVS4 + 4 A to T (IVS4), a splice mutation in intron 4, which has been found only in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. When we screened 29 Japanese patients (20 unrelated patients and 4 families) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism, we found 8 unrelated patients homozygous for IVS4. This is apparently the first non-Ashkenazi-Jewish population for whom this mutation has been detected. The Ashkenazi Jewish patients homozygous for IVS4 have a severe phenotype, in comparison with other FA patients. Our analyses of Japanese patients indicate no significant difference between IVS4 homozygotes and other patients with regard to severity of a clinical phenotype. Thus, ethnic background may have a significant effect on a clinical phenotype in FA patients carrying the same mutation. (Blood. 2000;95:1493-1498)
