OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of H(2) receptor antagonist cimetidine on the development of immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA) in mice. METHODS: The immune-mediated aplastic anemia mice model was induced by irradiation and half-matched allogeneic lymphocytes transfusion (ALT). The mice were divided into 3 groups: the irradiation alone control group, the irradiation + ALT group (AA group) and the irradiation + ALT + cimetidine group. In cimetidine group, each mouse was intraperitoneally injected cimetidine at different doses once a day for 8 days. On day 14, the bone marrow histology was examined. RESULTS: In 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg x (10g)(-1) x d(-1) cimetidine groups, the percentages of hematopoietic tissue volume in bone marrow were (46.58 +/- 20.41)%, (51.88 +/- 24.94)% and (59.12 +/- 32.48)%, respectively, and all much higher than that in AA group [(19.99 +/- 10.98)%, P < 0.01], but were not different from that in irradiated control group [(53.81 +/- 31.72)%, P > 0.05]. CONCLUSION: The development of immune-mediated aplastic anemia in irradiated mice by half-matched allogeneic lymphocytes transfusion was blocked by H(2) receptor antagonist cimetidine.
