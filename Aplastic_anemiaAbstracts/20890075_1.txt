 BACKGROUND: Immature platelet fraction (IPF, %) is a measure of reticulated platelets (RPs), which represents the state of thrombopoiesis. The IPF is obtained from an automated hematology analyzer as one of the platelet parameters. This study was performed to establish reference intervals of IPF and its cut-off values for the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Blood samples from 2,039 healthy individuals (1,161 males, 878 females) were obtained to establish reference intervals. The patient group included patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (N=150) and aplastic anemia (AA) (N=51) with platelet counts of less than 100Ã—10(9)/L. We evaluated the reliability of the IPF measurements, the reference intervals, and cut-off value for the diagnosis of ITP. RESULTS: The reference intervals of IPF were 0.5-3.2% in males and 0.4-3.0% in females (95% confidence interval). The median IPF% of ITP and AA were 7.7% (range, 1.0-33.8%) and 3.5% (range, 0.6-12.9%), respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the IPF% of ITP and AA (P<0.0001). The cut-off value of IPF for differentiating ITP from AA was 7.3% with a sensitivity and specificity of 54.0% and 92.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and inexpensive automated measurement of IPF can be integrated as a standard parameter to evaluate the thrombopoietic state of the bone marrow. This study determined the reference intervals of IPF from a large population of healthy individuals, including children. Further studies are needed to establish the clinical utility of IPF.
