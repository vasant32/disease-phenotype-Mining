A 41-year-old woman who had been given a diagnosis of aplastic anemia 14 years before was admitted because of recurrence of the disease. Despite therapy, the anemia progressed gradually. The patient refused blood product transfusions for religious reasons. Angina pectoris-like chest pain without ischemic changes on electrocardiograms appeared at a hemoglobin concentration (Hb) of 1.6 g/dl. The patient died of heart failure at Hb 1.5 g/dl. Autopsy showed enlargement of the heart, fatty changes in the myocardium and liver due to chronic hypoxia, and no changes in coronary arteries.
