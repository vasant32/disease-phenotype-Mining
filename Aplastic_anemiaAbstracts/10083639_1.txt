OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of allogeneic BMT in the treatment of childhood severe acquired aplastic anemia (SAAA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven children aged 2 to 16 years (median 11 years) received a BMT from an HLA identical sibling. Conditioning consisted in irradiation (total, nodal or thoraco-abdominal) plus cyclophosphamide (120-200 mg/kg) in 15 patients and cyclophosphamide alone (200 mg/kg) in the rest. Prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was cyclosporine and methotrexate in most patients. RESULTS: Twenty-four children achieved the bone marrow graft at a median of 18 days (neutrophils) and 21 days (platelets). Two patients failed engraftment and 1 had a late graft rejection. Three patients developed acute GVHD grades 3-4 and six chronic GVHD, which was extensive in 4 of them. Twenty patients/71%) are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 110 months and the estimated disease free survival at 6 years is 67%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling is the best treatment modality for children with SAAA. Acute GVHD associated with infections and graft rejection were responsible for treatment failures.
