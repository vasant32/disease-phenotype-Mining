We studied the potential value of oral ofloxacin (200 mg twice daily) for selective decontamination and infection prevention in 40 granulocytopenic patients with acute leukemia, blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, hairy cell leukemia or severe aplastic anemia. The quality of selective decontamination was acceptable with rapid elimination of Enterobacteriaceae from the alimentary tract, only a slight decrease in concentrations of anaerobes in faeces, and a small number of newly acquired transient (twelve isolates in seven patients) or colonizing (six strains with 28 isolates in four patients) aerobic gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus (one isolate) recovered from 672 surveillance cultures from faeces, oral washings and urine. Two of three patients colonized with ofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains developed Pseudomonas infections. A total of twelve acquired infections was observed. Six were microbiologically documented infections, all caused by ofloxacin-resistant bacteria (two P. aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Aerococcus viridans, one Micrococcus sp.). Tolerance was acceptable with no serious side effects observed. Mean drug concentrations in serum and saliva were comparable to those determined in healthy volunteers and were found to be higher in saliva than in serum. We conclude that ofloxacin may be studied as an effective alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for selective decontamination and infection prevention in severely granulocytopenic patients. Careful monitoring of colonizing Pseudomonas spp. with decreased ofloxacin sensitivity, however, seems necessary.
