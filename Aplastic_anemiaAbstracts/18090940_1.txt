Fanconi aplastic anemia (FAA), an inherited form of bone marrow failure syndrome, is characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and high risk of developing a malignancy. One or more congenital malformations may be detected in at least 90% of the affected individuals. Despite many forms of congenital malformations in FAA, there are no reports of coexisting FAA and diaphragmatic mesothelial cyst. Here, we report a 7-year-old female patient with FAA is associated with diaphragmatic mesothelial cyst.
