Forty-four patients with aplastic anemia or leukemia were given marrow grafts from siblings selected on the basis of HLA-A and -B identity and mutual nonreactivity of their lymphocytes in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). Twenty-two to 1089 days after grafting, their lymphocytes (of donor origin) were tested for reactivity in MLC to lymphocytes from the host (cryopreserved before grafting), the marrow donor, and unrelated individuals. Lymphocytes from 14 of 22 long-term survivors with chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) showed unidirectional reactivity in response to host lymphocytes manifested as high stimulation indices (SI) and high relative responses (RR). Lymphocytes from only 1 of 12 long-term survivors without chronic GVHD showed unidirectional reactivity to host lymphocytes. Statistical analysis showed that lymphocytes from patients with chronic GVHD displayed anti-host responses that were significantly higher than those of lymphocytes from either marrow donors (p < 0.001) or patients without GVHD (p = 0.03). Lymphocytes from 5 patients with and 5 without acute GVHD, tested shortly after marrow grafting, failed to show responses to host cells. The results are consistent with a participation of cell-mediated immunity of graft against host in chronic GVHD.
