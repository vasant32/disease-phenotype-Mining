Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare complication of viral hepatitis affecting mainly children or young adults. Most reported cases have been associated with community-acquired non-A, non-B hepatitis, but hepatitis A and B have also been implicated in a few patients. We report on a 43-year-old woman with severe AA, in association with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, diagnosed by detection of HCV RNA by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Her AA was successfully treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A. The hepatitis C progressed to chronic disease but, despite a follow-up time of 2 years, the patient still has no detectable anti-HCV antibodies, as evaluated with a second-generation anti-HCV assay.
