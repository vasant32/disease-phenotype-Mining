The results of the erytropoietin level determination in serum and urine of patients with congenital anemias are presented and compared to the results obtained in children with acute aplastic anemias. Three patients with congenital hypoplastic anemia Diamond-Blackfan, two with Fanconi's anemia, one with congenital pancythopenia with hyperplastic marrow and five patients with acute aplastic anemia were studied. The increased serum erythropoietin level was found in every patient whose blood hemoglobin was less than 12g%. Erythropoietin was detected in nonconcentrated urine when serum erythropoietin level was higher than 0,5 units/ml. The statistically significant negative correlation between the serum erythropoietin level and blood hemoglobin concentration was found. In two patients suffering from congenital anemias, in whome the significantly increased erythropoietin level (about 1.0 units/ml) was detected, increased ammount of hemoglobin F in peripheral blood as well as increased MCV--signs of so called "stress" erythropoiesis-were noted. The results presented, together with the results obtained by other authors, indicate that congenital anemias studied here are not due to the disturbance in erythropoietin production.
