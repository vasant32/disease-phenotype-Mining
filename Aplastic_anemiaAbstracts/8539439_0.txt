The hematopoietic regions were classified into two groups on the basis of out-of-phase T1-weighted images (op-T1WI): regions with lower intensity than that of muscle (LH) and regions with intensity equal to or higher than that of muscle (HH). We quantitatively evaluated the differences in signal intensity between LH and HH in order to examine this classification. Forty-two hematopoietic areas in aplastic anemia were classified into two groups of 23 LH and 19 HH. The signal ratios of hematopoietic areas to muscle on T1WI and STIR were calculated, and the differences between LH and HH were statistically evaluated. The signal ratios of LH were significantly higher on T1WI and lower on STIR than those of HH (unpaired t-test, p < 0.05). This result indicated that LH consisted of more hypocellular marrow than HH. Op-T1WI were useful in differentiating between LH and HH and defining the degree of hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia.
