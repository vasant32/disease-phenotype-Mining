Tc-99m colloid and In-111 transferrin were used in a semiquantitative scintigraphic study of bone-marrow activity in 76 patients with aplastic anemia, the majority of which were severe cases. The results are compared with other known prognostic parameters and with a predictive index formulated from a prior multi-parametric analysis performed in 352 cases. In 47 cases parallel abnormality of Tc and In uptakes was noted and was well correlated with other prognostic factors. Indium uptake is apparently a good indicator of the severity of aplasia; extension of active erythroid tissue, demonstrated with this method, is correlated with prognosis. In nine cases, excessive In uptake is explained by dyserythropoiesis associated with granulo- and thrombocytopenia (Fanconi's anemia in most cases). In 20 of our patients, TcSC uptake was excessive compared with that of In and with other prognostic factors. Statistically, this phenomenon carries an unfavorable prognosis but its physiological meaning remains to be defined.
