 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: Hematopoietic recovery (peripheral blood cell counts, bone marrow aspirates, bone marrow biopsy, in vitro culture of hematopoietic progenitors), immunity of T lymphocyte, quality of life and side-effects of the therapy were assessed in 50 SAA patients who have survived more than 3 years after IST. RESULTS: At 3 years, 4 years and 5 years follow-up, 81.5% (13 cases), 86.7% (13 cases) and 89.5% (17 cases) of the SAA patients reached and maintained normal peripheral blood cell counts, 93.4% (15 cases), 93.3% (14 cases) and 94.7% (18 cases) showed normal bone marrow pictures, and 37.5% (6 cases), 40.0% (6 cases) and 73.7% (14 cases) had normal yields of bone marrow cell culture, respectively. Overall, 86.0% (43 cases), 94.0% (47 cases) and 52.0% (26 cases) of the total SAA patients were normalized in peripheral blood counts, bone marrow picture and culture of hematopoietic progenitor yields, respectively. During the follow-up, 88.0% (44 cases) of the patients achieved 100 of Karnofsky scores; 26 of the 31 patients (83.9%) who received bone marrow biopsy showed normal histological pictures, and 29 of 37 patients (78.4%) tested had normal subsets of T lymphocytes. No clonal disease was found. The late side-effects of IST were mild. All of the parameters tested were normal in 24 patients. CONCLUSION: After IST, the hematopoietic function of bone marrow, the immunity of the T lymphocyte and the life quality were normalized with few side-effects in patients with SAA. These patients would probably be cured.
