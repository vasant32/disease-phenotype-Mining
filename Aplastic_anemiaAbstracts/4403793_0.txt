A 23-year-old woman gravely ill with Pseudomonas septicemia secondary to presumed drug-induced bone marrow aplasia received marrow transplantation from two male HL-A identical sibling donors. She had a successful engraftment with excellent but temporary clinical improvement. Subsequently she succumbed to graft-versus-host disease manifested by Pseudomonas and Candida albicans septicemia, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, three phases of dermatitis, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, diarrhea, fever, edema and bone pain, with gradual but complete graft suppression by the 74th day after the transplantation. A second marrow transplant on the 70th day was unsuccessful.
