Changes in bone marrow macrophages may be associated with abnormal hematopoiesis in various hematologic disorders. We immunohistochemically evaluated the density of macrophages in bone marrow trephine biopsies. In reactive erythroid hyperplasia (hemolytic anemia and megaloblastic anemia), the macrophages slightly increased in density, extending their cytoplasmic processes between hematopoietic cells. In erythroid hypoplasia (pure red cell aplasia), they became rounded and frequently had hemosiderin granules. There was no significant difference in the macrophage density in the hematopoietic area between erythroid hyperplasia and hypoplasia. The macrophages increased in density in myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera, chronic myelogenous leukemia and primary thrombocythemia). In myelofibrosis, some macrophages became extremely elongated along the line of the fibroblastic cells. In contrast, in conditions in which myelopoietic activity is considerably impaired (aplastic anemia, acute leukemia and multiple myeloma), they significantly decreased in density. These results suggest that the morphologic change in bone marrow macrophages is associated with erythropoietic activity and that there is a correlation between macrophage density and myelopoietic activity.
