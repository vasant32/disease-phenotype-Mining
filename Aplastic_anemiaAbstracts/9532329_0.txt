Meropenem was used in the treatment of 14 infectious complications in 11 patients including 8 with acute myeloid leukemia due to the cytostatic therapy, 1 with chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 with aplastic anemia and 1 with acute intermittent porphyria. At the moment of the meropenem use critical neutropenia (less than 500 granulocytes per 1 ml) in 11 cases (79 per cent) was stated. The drug was administered as intravenous infusions in a dose of 1 g every 8 hours for 4 to 41 days (the median of 11 days). 9 out of the 14 infectious complications were cured (the body temperature normalized and all the inflammation foci were eliminated), among them 6 out of 8 pyocyanic sepsis. Eradication of gram-negative bacteria was observed in 8 out of 10 cultures of the biological materials. No toxic complications or electrolytic disorders due to the drug use were recorded. The drug tolerance was good.
