We studied the myeloid colony-stimulating activity (CSA) of marrow stromal cells (MSC) derived from normal subjects and patients with aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and other myeloproliferative disorders. CSA of the MSC was determined in a bilayer system. Feeder layers with varying numbers of MSC (10(4) to 2 X 10(5)) were used. Of 40 MSC tested, 39 stimulated myeloid colony formation by the normal target marrow mononuclear cells. The optimal concentration of MSC exhibiting the maximal stimulation of myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM) varied with different MSC. MSC from normal subjects and from patients with acute leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders were potent stimulators of CFU-GM differentiation. In contrast, MSC from patients with aplastic anemia had poor CSA, suggesting that the marrow microenvironment is functionally abnormal in aplastic anemia.
