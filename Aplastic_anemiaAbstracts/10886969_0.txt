With significant improvements in the rates of graft rejection and acute graft-vs-host disease, bone marrow transplantation remains the therapy of choice for the young aplastic anemia patient with an HLA-matched related donor. While immunosuppressive therapy can induce responses in a significant proportion of patients, long-term follow-up studies have demonstrated a high rate of relapses and evolution to malignant clonal hematopoietic disorders. Therefore, this therapeutic option should be considered for patients who are not transplant candidates. The potential roles for hematopoietic growth factors and alternative marrow donors needs to be further defined.
