The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of immunosuppressive therapy on the expression of TNF-α/IFN-γ in cytoplasm of peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with aplastic anemia (AA). The expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in cytoplasm of peripheral CD3(+) lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry in 25 cases of de novo AA patients and 20 cases of AA after immunosuppressive therapy. The results showed that the positive rates of CD3(+)/TNF-α(+) and CD3(+)/IFN-γ(+) in de novo AA patients were (5.97 ± 6.78)% and (15.20 ± 11.28)% respectively, and (1.56 ± 0.87)% and (1.76 ± 0.87)% in normal controls respectively. There was significant difference between de novo AA patients and normal controls (p < 0.05). The positive rates of CD3(+)/TNF-α(+) and CD3(+)/IFN-γ(+) in immunosuppressive therapy group were (1.67 ± 1.26)% and (4.35 ± 4.33)% respectively. The difference between immunosuppressive therapy group and de novo AA group was statistically significant (p < 0.05). It is concluded that the levels of intracellular TNF-α and IFN-γ in AA patients are higher than those in normal controls. Immunosuppressive therapy significantly reduces the expression of intracellular TNF-α and IFN-γ. Its relationship with the clinical treatment is worth further observing.
