Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to be involved in the growth, production, proliferation and differentiation of the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells, while aplastic anemia (AA) is a disease in which proliferation ability of the BM hematopoietic cells is damaged with defective hematopoietic microenvironment. To investigated the pathogenesis of AA, the rennin activity, angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration in peripheral blood and BM of 22 AA patients were detected by radioimmunoassay, 16 nonhematological disease patients with normal blood counts and BM picture were used as control, and the difference between two groups was compared. The results showed that BM Ang II concentration in the AA patients was significantly lower than that in the control (P < 0.01). In nonhematological disease patients, Ang II concentration in BM was significantly higher than that in peripheral blood, the renin activities and Ang I concentrations were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the decreased BM Ang II concentration in AA patients may be involved to the pathogenesis of AA.
