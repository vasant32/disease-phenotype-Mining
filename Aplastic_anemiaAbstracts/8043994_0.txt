Hemopoietic progenitor cells (BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM) of 69 cases of aplastic anemia were cultured in vitro while the sensitivity of CFU-E and BFU-E to androgen was assayed. The suppressive effect of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) from patients on normal CFU-GM growth was also studied. Hence 69 cases of aplastic anemia were divided into three types: 10 cases of stem cell deficiency type, 30 cases of immuno-mediated type and 29 cases of androgen response type. According to above classification, different treatment programs were practiced using both TCM and western medicine. In the androgen response type, androgen and TCM were used and the effective rate reached 92.3%. In the immuno-mediated type, in addition to TCM. Immunosuppressive agents were cautiously used and the effective rate was 70.6%. As for the stem cell deficiency type, 10 patients' conditions were usually very severe so comprehensive therapeutical means were adopted and 3 cases were improved. The overall response rate of these three was 73.2%. These results showed that the treatment program under the direction of classification have greatly improved the curative effect.
