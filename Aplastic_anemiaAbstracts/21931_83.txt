A prospective study of 80 bone marrow transplant recipients with acute leukemia and aplastic anemia employed serial viral cultures, determination of complement-fixing antibody to cytomegalovirus (CMV), and study of material obtained from open lung biopsy and autopsy. There were 43 episodes of interstitial pneumonia, 28 of which were fatal. About 40% of the cases were idiopathic. CMV was the most common candidate pathogen, present in 47% of affected lungs. By a median of 53 days following transplantation, 46% of the recipients were shedding CMV from some site. This event was three times more frequent among recipients who had positive titers of antibody to CMV before transplantation than among seronegative recipients. Failure to respond werologically to CMV infection markedly increased the hazard of dying of interstitial pneumonia. Graft-vs-host disease significantly increased the incidence and lethality of interstitial pneumonia. The presence of leukemia (rather than aplastic anemia) and/or certain factors in the technique of preparation for engraftment may have been significant.
