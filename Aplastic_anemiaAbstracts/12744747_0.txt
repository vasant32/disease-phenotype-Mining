In order to explore the serum level of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in hematopathy patients, radioimmunoassay was used to detect GM-CSF level in serum from 163 cases of hematopathy, including 36 chronic aplastic anemia, 42 chronic granulocytic leukemia, 54 acute myeloid leukemia, 31 acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 40 healthy adults as control. The results showed that the serum GM-CSF level increased in chronic aplastic anemia patients, and significantly decreased in acute and chronic leukemia patients. In conclusion, these findings indicated that secreting level of GM-CSF is abnormal in patients with acute/chronic leukemias and chronic aplastic anemia.
