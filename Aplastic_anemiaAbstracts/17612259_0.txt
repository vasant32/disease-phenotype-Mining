We examined the clinical evaluation of biapenem (BIPM) for febrile neutropenia in patients with hematological disorders. BIPM was administrated by drip infusion when fever developed over 37.5 degrees C with a neutrophil counts lower than 1000/microl. The underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia in 16 cases, acute lymphocytic leukemia in 1, malignant lymphoma in 14, myelodysplastic syndrome in 1, aplastic anemia in 1. Microbiologically documented infections were found in 3 cases (9.1%) before treatment. Clinical effect was excellent in 9 cases, good in 11, fair in 6, poor in 7. Factors associated with efficacy rate were concomitant use of granulocytecolony stimulating factor, duration of neutropenia and neutrophil counts at day 3 of day after start of the therapy. No serious adverse events were observed in all cases, although one case developed exanthema. In conclusion, these results confirmed the efficacy and safety of BIPM for febrile neutropenia in patients with hematological disorders.
