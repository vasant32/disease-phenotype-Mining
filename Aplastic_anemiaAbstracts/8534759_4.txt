The aim of this study was to measure the level of cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and to determine their effect on the clonal growth of normal bone marrow (BM) cells. Twenty-one patients with AA and 11 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Medium conditioned by PBMNC of AA patients in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to be suppressive to the colony growth of normal BM cells. Thus, we further determined the presence in the PBMNC-conditioned medium (CM) of both inhibitory cytokines: macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and stimulatory cytokines: interleukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor (SCF). Spontaneous production of MIP-1 alpha was higher in the AA patients than the normal controls (1887 +/- 174 pg/ml vs 1643 +/- 93 pg/ml), but the difference was not significant. After LPS stimulation, the production of MIP-1 alpha was markedly increased in the AA patients, and its level was significantly higher than that of the normal controls (2360 +/- 149 pg/ml vs 1517 +/- 92 pg/ml, p = 0.0022). The level of TNF alpha was also higher in the AA patients. However, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta 2, SCF, and IL-3 were not detectable in the PBMNC-CM of either AA patients or normals. The myelopoietic suppressing effect of AA-PBMNC-CM from each AA patient was significantly blocked by pretreatment with anti-TNF-alpha, resulting in a colony-forming enhancement of 174% +/- 12%. A similar effect was noted in six of 11 AA patients by pretreatment with anti-MIP-1 alpha. We conclude that TNF alpha and MIP-1 alpha can be overproduced by the PBMNC of some AA patients, which may play a role in the progression of AA.
