We report two sisters affected with a unique disorder characterized by recurrent space-occupying brain lesions and retinal vasculopathy since their early twenties. Affection status was associated with abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi's anemia, i.e. aplastic anemia, microcephaly, short stature, an unusual face and pigmentation abnormalities of skin. In cytogenetic analyses performed in childhood signs of chromosome fragility or any chromosomal aberration were lacking. Histopathological examination of brain biopsy samples in both cases demonstrated identical histomorphological features of an unusual occlusive vasculopathy with multilayered basement membranes and coagulation necroses which were confined to the white matter. A veno-occlusive retinopathy with neovascularization attributed to progressive visual loss. One of the sisters died at an age of just 24 years, the other is now 27 years old. Unlike any other published cases of hereditary cerebroretinal vasculopathy, the sisters' complex early-onset vaso-occlusive CNS-/eye-disease seems to be genetically associated with their Fanconi's anemia-like phenotypes and is suggested to constitute an autosomal-recessive variant. Patchy white matter calcifications, an incidental finding in either of the affected sisters, may represent preclinical manifestation of disease onset in childhood.
