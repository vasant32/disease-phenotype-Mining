The CM-S cell line was established from the bone marrow of a child with congenital hypoplastic anemia and resembles its monocyte-macrophage lineage. Lethally x-irradiated CM-S cells from various passages and clones, representing different stages in the progression of the transformed growth phenotype, were tested for their ability to affect the survival and proliferation of normal human cord or adult blood leukocytes in co-culture. One clone, CM-SM, which is tumorigenic in athymic mice, consistently immortalized umbilical cord mononuclear cells but did not immortalize adult peripheral blood leukocytes. Six autonomous monocyte-like diploid cell lines were obtained and all were found to be of cord origin. Three lines were tumorigenic in athymic mice. Attempts to immortalize human leukocytes with cell-free supernatants from CM-S cells were unsuccessful.
