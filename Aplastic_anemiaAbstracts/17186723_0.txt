 OBJECTIVE: To explore the immune pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA) and the therapeutic effects of Shengxue Mixture (SM) through the gene expressions of subfamilies of T-cell receptor variable region beta (TCR Vbeta) using immunologic and molecular biologic technology. METHODS: Gene expressions of TCR Vbeta sub-families in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 AA patients were detected before and after treatment with SM using RT-PCR and gene scanning method. RESULTS: TCR Vbeta gene repertoire of the 24 subfamily genes deviated in AA patients, and the oligoclonal gene expressions increased obviously compared with those in healthy people (P < 0.01), including Vbeta2, 5, 6, 15, 16, 22, and 23 were found in 30%-50% AA patients, and Vbeta8, 21 were in more than 50% patients. These oligoclonal genes reduced significantly after treatment with SM compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Multiple TCR Vbeta subfamilies of clonal proliferation participate in the pathogenesis of AA. SM can rectify the deviation of TCR Vbeta gene repertoire, reduce the abnormal clonal proliferation of T cells, thus to alleviate the immune injury to hematopoietic tissue, and thus to benefit the recovery of hematopoiesis of bone marrow.
