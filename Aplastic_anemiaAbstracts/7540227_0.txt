A 19-year-old male who suffered from severe aplastic anemia had been treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) from September 1991. Marked increase of hematopoietic cells in his bone marrow was observed, and maintenance administration of G-CSF was continued. 15 months later, myeloblasts with nuclear abnormality increased, and 22 months later, myeloblasts with chromosomal abnormality presenting 46, XY, -7, +21 exceeded 20%, and aplastic anemia seemed to be transformed into refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB in T). The usefulness of G-CSF in the treatment of aplastic anemia is now established, but there are some reports questioning the effect of long-term administration, especially transformation to MDS with monosomy 7. Leukemic transformation from aplastic anemia is very complex, but in some cases, long term administration of G-CSF may affect the natural course and may lead to the earlier development of leukemia.
