Since 1976, more than 180 patients suffering from leukemia or aplastic anemia have been treated with BMT and TBI. The improvement of TBI-technique starting from single fraction irradiation without any shielding to different types of fractionation schemes with lung, head and neck shielding and an electron boost to the thoracal wall is shown. A more detailed description of the actual TBI-technique is given; this has been applied to 64 patients to-date. Some clinical results are summarised into four subgroups. Life table analyses are shown for single fraction irradiation as well as for fractionated irradiation separated for high and for low risk patient groups.
