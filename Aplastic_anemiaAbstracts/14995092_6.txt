A method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated for the qualitative and quantitative detection of chloramphenicol (CAP) in seafood samples. The analysis of CAP residues in seafood is important because CAP can cause serious acute reactions in humans, including aplastic anemia and leukemia. The proposed methodology includes a cleanup solid-phase extraction procedure with high recovery efficiency (>90%). Chromatographic separation of CAP and the internal standard (IS) was carried out on a C(18) column, followed by mass spectrometric detection using electrospray ionization in the negative-ion mode. The precursor/product ion transitions 321-->257 (CAP) and 354-->290 (IS) were monitored. Statistical evaluation of this multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometric procedure reveals good linearity, accuracy, and inter- and intraday precisions. The limit of detection was 0.1 ng/mL, and the limit of quantification for CAP in seafood samples is 0.02 microg/kg. Application in seafood samples allowed the detection of CAP in low parts per billion levels.
