Immunologic abnormalities have been described in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The concurrent diagnoses of Hodgkin lymphoma and acquired aplastic anemia, however, is extremely rare. We report a 56-year-old Japanese female patient with severe aplastic anemia and increased large granular lymphocytes prior to the recurrence of Hodgkin lymphoma. After being in remission for 10 years from Hodgkin lymphoma, she developed progressive pancytopenia. The large granular lymphocytes (expressed CD3+ CD8+ TCRalphabeta+) had a polyclonal distribution, the serum-soluble FasL concentration was significantly elevated, and bone marrow biopsy showed severely hypocellular bone marrow without infiltration of abnormal lymphocytes. No lymphadenopathy was observed that would suggest a relapse of Hodgkin lymphoma. A diagnosis of aplastic anemia was made, and treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine was initiated. Two months later, she suddenly developed celiac and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She underwent one cycle of chemotherapy before she died of progressive pancytopenia. Autopsy revealed the recurrence of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis in the lymph nodes and markedly hypocellular bone marrow. Although autoimmune disorders are described in Hodgkin lymphoma, our case shows a rare instance of a patient who had aplastic anemia as the first manifestation of a relapse of Hodgkin lymphoma.
