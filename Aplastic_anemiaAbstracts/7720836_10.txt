We described a fully automated measurement of reticulated platelets using a fluorescent dye, auramine O, and a reticulocyte counter, the R-3000, equipped with special software. Reproducibility and linearity were shown to be good. In the normal subjects studied (n = 60), the mean value for reticulated platelets was 0.98% +/- 0.41% and the mean absolute count was 2.12 +/- 0.69 x 10(9)/l. The absolute count for reticulated platelets was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in patients with reduced thrombopoiesis as seen in acute myeloblastic leukemia, aplastic anemia or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and it was elevated (p < 0.05) in essential thrombocythemia and in chronic myelocytic leukemia with thrombocytosis. All 20 patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had a high percentage of reticulated platelets. The percentage of reticulated platelets was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in patients with impaired thrombopoiesis despite the reduction in the absolute count. In 2 leukemic patients, an apparent rise was noticed in the percentage of reticulated platelets which preceded by several days a progressive increase in the platelet count at the recovery phase of thrombocytopenia. The results suggest that an automated measurement of reticulated platelets can be applied to routine laboratories for clinical use.
