Eight patients with aplastic anemia were transplanted with marrow from HLA-identical donors. Two patient rejected their grafts and died while 5 patients (71%) show no ill effects 3 months, 10 months, and more than 1, 2 and 4 years after the transplantation. Three of the patients who received unirradiated donor buffy coat after transplantation developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) which, however, resolved following treatment with Prednisolone and Azathioprine. One patient with end-stage acute myeloid leukemia, who was transplanted with marrow from an identical twin, died 6 days after the transplantation of bleedings and sepsis. Eight patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANL) were transplanted, while in remission, with marrow from HLA-identical siblings. One patient died of interstitial pneumonia 3 months after transplantation, while another patient recovered from GVHD of the gut at 5 months after the transplantation. Seven out of 8 patients with ANL (88%) are home and well between 2 and 12 months after the transplantation.
