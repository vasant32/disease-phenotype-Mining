Severe aplastic anemia developed in a patient after administration of quinacrine for treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. Marrow transplantation was performed from an HLA genotypically identical sister after conditioning with cyclophosphamide. Quinacrine which was accumulated in the patient tissues did not interfere with engraftment, suggesting that the drug has no direct cytotoxic effect on hematopoietic stem cells. This study extends our previous observation that severe aplastic anemia acquired after exposure to drugs or toxins can be cured by marrow transplantation.
