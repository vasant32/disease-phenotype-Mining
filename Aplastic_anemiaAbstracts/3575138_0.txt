In 1984 an extensive review of phenylbutazone risks was undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since that review, new recommendations for the drug's use have been published. Marketed in 1952, phenylbutazone has long been recognized as capable of inducing aplastic anemia. The risk of marrow depression is greatest in elderly females treated for over a month. Overall, the risk does not exceed that of many commonly used drugs (e.g., penicillin, which induces anaphylaxis). Nonetheless, phenylbutazone should not be a drug of first choice and should not be used for minor, self-limited conditions.
