This report describes a patient with lymphocyte depleted Hodgkin's disease who presented with bone marrow aplasia. The aplastic marrow reverted to normal after initiation of MOPP chemotherapy; however, 4 months after completion of therapy, bone marrow aplasia recurred in the absence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease. The patient remains free of Hodgkin's disease 34 months after completion of chemotherapy. Bone marrow abnormalities in Hodgkin's disease are reviewed and the current understanding of the pathological mechanisms leading to aplastic anemia is discussed.
