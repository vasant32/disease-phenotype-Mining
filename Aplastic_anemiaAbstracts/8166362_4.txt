PURPOSE: The aim of the therapeutic trial was to try to optimize the treatment of severe and moderate aplastic anemia in children who lack a suitable bone marrow donor using the most successful available drugs, with the least amount of side effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pilot study for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia in children was conducted by four institutions. The treatment protocol included antithymocyte globulin (ATG), prednisone, and cyclosporine A. Twelve patients were enrolled, and 11 were evaluable. All patients had severe aplastic anemia (SAA); three had hepatitis-induced severe aplastic anemia (HI-SAA). RESULTS: Of 11 evaluable patients, eight have responded with normalization of their blood counts. Two of the three patients with HI-SAA responded to the therapy. CONCLUSION: The results of our pilot study compare favorably with previous therapeutic trials. All the patients who responded achieved complete response, i.e., restoration of blood counts to within the normal range.
