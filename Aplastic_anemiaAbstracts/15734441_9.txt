We report a successful case of living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT) for severe bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The patient is a 29-year-old woman who underwent BMT because of aplastic anemia in 1995. In 1996, BO developed in the patient because of chronic graft-versus-host disease. In May 2000, a LDLLT was performed. Pulmonary function tests showed improvement of both vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. At present, 91 months after BMT and 38 months after lung transplantation, the patient is in good health. LDLLT may offer a therapeutic option for the treatment of BO after BMT.
