Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies of 20 patients with malignant tumors (n = 6), bone marrow failure due to chemotherapy (n = 4), myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 5) and aplastic anemia (n = 5) were analysed before and after treatment with recombinant human interleukin-3. rhIL-3 led to increased overall bone marrow cellularity with trilinear stimulation of hematopoietic cells. In all patients marked eosinophilia and, in some, fibrosis was observed. These results show that rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and may contribute to the treatment of bone marrow failure.
