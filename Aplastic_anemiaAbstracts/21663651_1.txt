 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy with umbilical cord blood support for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). METHODS: A total of 25 patients with SAA received enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy and a cord blood transfusion. Therapy protocol: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/(kg•d) × 5d; Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/(kg•d) × 2d; cyclosporin A (CsA) maintenance therapy. RESULT: 25 patients were enrolled. 18 underwent a complete recovery, 4 made significant improvements, 1 did not respond, and 2 died. Therefore, the efficacy rate was 88%. The median follow-up time was 35 months (range 13-47 months), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 92%. Patients rapidly achieved reconstitution of hematopoiesis. The median time to neutrophil ANC > 0.5 × 109/L was 18 days (range 8-36), platelets >20 × 109/L was 34 days (range 12-123), and Hb > 100 g/L 95 days (range 35-173). CONCLUSION: Enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy with umbilical cord blood support may be an effective option for SAA therapy.
