Longitudinal neurodevelopmental studies of four consecutive young children treated by bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia or aplastic anemia are presented. The children, the only four children less than 2 years of age who have received bone marrow transplants for these diseases at UCLA Medical Center, ranged in age from 36 weeks to 24 months at the time of transplantation. Conditioning involved high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment; three also had total body irradiation prior to bone marrow transplantation. Their respective outcomes after follow-up times of 28 months to 71 months posttransplantation are remarkable for normal somatic growth and normal development of intelligence, language, perception, and motor coordination. These findings indicate that future therapeutic studies of infants and young children with acute leukemia or aplastic anemia using total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and bone marrow transplantation are not contraindicated by risks of debilitating neurodevelopmental sequelae.
