Immunochemical assay using monoclonal antibodies was carried out to determine levels of a number of complement components (C3 and its derivatives-C4 and C5) and immunoglobulins (lg) in plasma of patients with onco-hematological diseases involving defective hemopoiesis: leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (clonal diseases) or aplastic anemia (delayed clonal disease). The most significant disorders were registered in the concentrations of component C3 and its derivatives. In acute leukemia, the nature and extent of C3 splitting was found to depend on disease while Ig level-on stage. Myelodisplasia usually involved a 2-3-fold decrease in C3 level matched by a rise in the concentrations of its derivatives-C3-like form and C3a fragment. Reduced C3 levels matched by increased ones of Ig were observed in some cases of aplastic anemia. It is suggested that disturbances in complement component level may cause changes in cascade reactions of the complement in onco-hematological patients and thus indirectly influence immune response regulation processes.
