 OBJECTIVE: To detect the incidence of the HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and aplastic anemia (AA), and analyze the relationship of these mutations with iron metabolism, and organs impairment from iron overload. METHODS: The incidence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in 271 MDS, 402 AA patients and 1615 normal subjects was measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) combining with DNA sequencing. Iron metabolism parameters and iron overload indices were retrospectively compared between HFE gene mutation and unmutation groups in MDS and AA patients with no transfusion history. RESULTS: No C282Y and C282Y/H63D compound mutation was detected in all the three groups. The incidence of H63D heterozygous and homozygous genotype did not significantly differ between AA cases and controls (9.7% vs 10.2%, 0.25% vs 0.24% respectively, both P > 0.05). The frequency of H63D heterozygous genotype in MDS patients was significantly lower than that in controls (4.1% vs 10.2%, P = 0.002). H63D homozygous was not found in MDS patients. In both MDS and AA patients with no RBC transfusion history, serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation value (TS), serum iron concentration (SI) were close to or higher than normal; and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) value was significantly lower. There was no significant difference in SF, SI, TS values between HFE-mutation and -unmutation MDS patients. For AA patients, only the level of SI was significantly higher in HFE-mutant group than in -unmutation group [42.6 (24.6-60.4) micromol/L vs 32.0 (8.4-63.3) micromol/L, P = 0.011]. There was no significant difference in the values of liver enzyme, fasting blood sugar (FBS), abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral blood indices between HFE-mutation and -unmutation MDS and AA groups (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations has ethnic and genetic disparity, the frequency in Chinese population is lower than that in Caucasian. It seems that MDS and AA patients are susceptible to iron overload, in the diseases itself and the mutations of HFE gene are not the major factor for iron overload in the patients.
