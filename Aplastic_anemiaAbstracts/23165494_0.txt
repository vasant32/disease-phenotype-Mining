Matched related donor allo-SCT is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) younger than 40 years of age. The standard conditioning regimen for such patients is cyclophosphamide with antithymocyte globulin. Unmanipulated BM is the best stem cell source for aplastic anemia patients going for SCT. Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine should be continued for 1 year. Early graft failure is rare but potentially life-threatening complication of SCT that can be managed with salvage SCT using more intense conditioning regimen.
