We report a patient who developed Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) after treatment with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine for aplastic anemia. The clinical course was progressive and poor prognosis. Although MCC is relatively rare in second cancers arising after immunosuppressive therapy, patients should be closely monitored for the development of this complication as well as other second malignancies.
