Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also referred to as pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), is characterized by high intracranial pressure, normal cerebral ventricles,and cerebrospinal fluid. Although papilledema is described in various anemias, only one case of PTC with idiopathic aplastic anemia has been reported in the English literature. We report a case of papilledema in an adolescent with aplastic anemia and propose its mechanism.
