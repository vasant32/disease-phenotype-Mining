OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia. METHODS: The spleen cells of BALB/c miceimmunized with rhG-CSF were fused with myeloma cell line SP2/0. Three murine hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody (McAb) against rhG-CSF were obtained. Serum levels of G-CSF in 54 cases of chronic aplastic anemia (CAA) were detected by ELISA method. RESULTS: Serum G-CSF levels in 70.4% (38 of 54 cases) of the CAA patients were increased (272.76 +/- 58.39ng/L). There was a negative correlation between blood neutrophil counts and serum G-CSF levels (r = -0.535, P<0.01). CFU-GM were detected in 12 cases of CAA, and all was decreased (17.92 +/- 10.28/2 x 10(5) nucleated cell). Serum G-CSF levels in almost 30% (12 of 54 cases) of the CAA patients were not increased. CONCLUSION: The hematopoietic progenitor cells of CAA patients were impaired, and some CAA could be treated with rhG-CSF and immunosuppressive agents.
