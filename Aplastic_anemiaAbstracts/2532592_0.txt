Erythrocyte complement receptor type 1 (CR1) was measured in 37 normal controls and in 95 patients with various hematologic diseases. Levels of erythrocyte CR1 were significantly decreased in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), aplastic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and multiple myeloma when compared to normal controls. There was also a trend of recovery of erythrocyte CR1 levels in AML and ALL patients when they were in a state of complete remission compared to those at time of onset or relapse. Further investigation is needed as to determine whether the level of erythrocyte CR1 can serve as a predictor for relapse of leukemia. This study also showed that the level of erythrocyte CR1 was not related to prognostic factors in NHL patients.
