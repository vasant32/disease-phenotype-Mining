A 69-year-old female was admitted for pancytopenia. The hematological examination showed leukocytes 1,800/microliters, hemoglobin 5.3 g/dl and platelets 9.6 x 10(4)/microliters. A bone marrow aspiration revealed hypoplasia, but no abnormal cells. Serum erythropoietin titer was 5,100 mU/ml. Diagnosis of aplastic anemia was made. She received 400 ml of blood transfusion twice, and was then treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) (12,000 U/day) three times a week for eight weeks. Hemoglobin level gradually increased to the level of 12.0 g/dl. This case suggests that there are some cases of aplastic anemia which can respond to treatment with rHuEPO.
