 OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term effectiveness and tolerance of rituximab in patients with systemic lupus erythematous and distinct clinical manifestations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients were studied. Rituximab (RTX) was indicated for refractory nephritis in 6 patients, severe thrombocytopenia in 5, aplastic anemia in 1 and peritoneal vasculitis associated with nephritis in 1. All patients received 4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m(2) of RTX. The mean length of follow-up was 12Â±8.5 months. Response was favorable in 9 patients: 3 with nephritis, 5 with thrombocytopenia and 1 with peritoneal vasculitis and nephritis. The mean SLE disease activity index decreased from 11 to 6.5 points. Thrombocytopenia recurred in 2 patients, who responded well to retreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that RTX is safe and effective as short-term therapy for distinct clinical manifestations associated with SLE.
