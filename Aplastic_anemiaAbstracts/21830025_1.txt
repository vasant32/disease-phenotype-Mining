 OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical characteristics of parvovirus (B19) related aplastic anemia (AA). METHODS: Of the 28 children with AA included in this study, 24 were treated routinely and received planned follow-up; 15 were subject to B19-DNA re-examination during the treatment and 8 underwent examination for B19-IgM and B19-IgG. Another 39 initially identified AA children were enrolled as the controls and received the treatment same as the above-mentioned group. RESULTS: There were more patients aged 5-8 y in the B19 infection group than the control group (P < 0.05). The course of AA in the B19 infection group was less than 2 mo and the serious aplastic anemia (SAA) and very serious aplastic anemia (VSAA) were more frequently observed in this group than the controls (P < 0.05). The overall efficacy of the treatments in the B19 infection group was more dismal than that in the controls (P < 0.05). Among 15 patients who were subjected to B19-DNA re-examination, negative findings were found in 6 patients with chronic aplastic anemia (CAA); the B19-DNA was persistently positive in 2 of the SAA and 5 VSAA patients. IgM and IgG were respectively detected in 3 and 2 patients out of the 8 children who received antibody examination. CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirus B19 infection contributes to the generation of AA, particularly in children aged 5-8 y. The AA induced may be mainly classified as serious and very serious type, with a course of disease less than 2 mo. Patients can be saved if B19-DNA is eliminated and the antibody is produced.
