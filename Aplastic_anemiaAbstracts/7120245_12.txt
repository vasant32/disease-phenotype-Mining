Several cases of eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) later complicated by serious hematological disorders such as immune thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia have been reported. Further study of these cases has led some investigators to postulate that EF may be the result of an "aberrant lymphoplasmacytic proliferation". A case of EF complicated by the later occurrence of Hodgkin's disease is reported here. This case adds further evidence to support the above hypothesis.
