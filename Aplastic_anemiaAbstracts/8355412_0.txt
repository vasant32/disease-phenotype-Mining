We evaluated a newly developed enzymeimmunoassay for serum erythropoietin (Epo) and investigated relationship between Epo levels and hematological disorders. This method has several advantages including simplicity, high sensitivity, good precision. Moreover, the procedure requires only about 2.5 hours. Samples from 134 healthy subjects showed a normal logarithmic distribution, and its normal range was 4.5 approximately 21.3 mU/ml. The levels of Epo in normal subjects and various hematological disorders were as follows: 10.5 +/- 4.1 (mean +/- SD mU/ml) in normal subjects, 2.2 +/- 1.7 in polycythemia vera (PV), 6.1 +/- 3.1 in essential thrombocythemia, 17.8 +/- 27.3 in chronic myelogeneous leukemia, 3.6 +/- 1.8 in stress erythrocytosis, 39.4 and 14.1 in two cases of primary myelofibrosis, 1289 +/- 4798 in iron deficiency anemia and 6564 +/- 10870 in aplastic anemia. In patients with PV, serum Epo were low and did not correlate with hemoglobin concentration. However, inverse correlation was found between changes of Epo levels and hemoglobin levels in most patients. In cases in which PV progressed into myelofibrosis, anemia developed and Epo levels increased accordingly. These results suggest that the method is thought to be useful and reliable for the diagnosis and monitoring of PV and related hematological disorders.
