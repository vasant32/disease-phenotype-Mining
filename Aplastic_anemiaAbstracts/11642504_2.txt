Patients with coincidental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for drug induced aplastic anemia have been fortuitously cured of RA. Other than these examples with allogeneic HSCT, there is no known curative therapy for RA. Despite its potential to cure, allogeneic transplantation is not being offered to patients with RA due to transplant related mortality. Advances in HSCT conditioning regimens and better prevention of graft-versus-host disease should allow consideration of allogeneic HSCT as therapy for severe RA. We propose a new, well tolerated, nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant regimen as treatment for RA.
