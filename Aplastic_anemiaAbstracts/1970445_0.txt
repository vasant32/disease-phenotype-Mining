The authors evaluate a method of procuring and preserving fetal liver cells in a medium containing low-molecular polyvynilpyrrolidon, glucose, lactose, sodium phosphate and sodiumhydrocitrate not requiring washing off. The biomaterial is stored at a temperature of -196 degrees C. The efficiency of this method of cryopreservation of fetal liver cell suspensions was confirmed by high morphological intactness, functional activity and proliferative capacity. Patients with hypoplastic anemia subjected to transfusion of cryopreserved fetal liver cells showed a normalization of bone marrow hemopoiesis, remissions.
