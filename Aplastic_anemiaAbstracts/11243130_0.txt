OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of cellular immune function and cytokines on the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia (AA) and its clinical significance. METHODS: T lymphocyte subsets and HLA-DR antigen expression in the peripheral blood cells were assayed, and the levels of G-CSF, IL-6, TNF alpha, IFN alpha and IL-8 in the PBMNC culture supernatants were determined in 38 AA patients and 20 normal control with APAAP and ELISA methods. RESULTS: CD4+ cells, CD4+/CD8+ cells and G-CSF level were lower, and CD8+ cells, HLA-DR+ cells and IL-6, TNF alpha, IFN alpha and IL-8 levels were higher in AA patients than in normal controls. The level of G-CSF was positively correlated with CD4+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ cells and negatively with IFN alpha level. IL-6 level was negatively correlated with WBC count and CD4+ cells. TNF alpha level was positively correlated with CD8+ cells and negatively with CD4+/CD8+ cells. IL-8 level was positively correlated with CD8+ cells and HLA-DR+ cells. CONCLUSION: The cellular immune dysfunction and cytokine aberration participate in the pathogenesis of AA.
