We report a patient who underwent peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (PBHP) autologous transplantation for his third SAA relapse. Although his repeated relapses were always successfully reversed by immunosuppression, he developed anaphylaxis with horse, rabbit and mouse immunoglobulins as a side-effect of his previous treatment. He was mobilized with G-CSF and underwent three leukaphereses in the period of hematologic recovery after the second relapse. Fourteen months later, he suffered his third relapse, rescued by autologous PBHP transplantation after cyclophosphamide and melphalan conditioning. At present he is 15 months after transplantation without any treatment, transfusion-independent and in good condition. Others have published the observation that sufficient PBHP can be collected at least in some patients with SAA. Our experience shows that in repeatedly relapsing SAA with no other treatment options autologous transplantation with previously collected PBHP can result in successful hematologic reconstitution.
