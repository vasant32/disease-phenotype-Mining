 UNLABELLED: 18 patients with refractory complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization resistant at common AED were studied. They were treated in a open label study with felbamate for a 22 months period. Felbamate monotherapy show a statistical significant improvement in the control of seizures in these patients versus CBZ therapy. No severe side effects were reported specially aplastic anemia or hepatic failure. At present, after 2 years, all the patients are still treated with felbamate. CONCLUSIONS: felbamate appears to be an effective new AED: the most adverse effects occurring during administration of FBM are mild to moderate gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and anorexia) and central nervous system (headache, sonnolence, diplopia, dizziness and insomnia) disturbances. These adverse effects last, generally, for three weeks and allow to continue the treatment.
