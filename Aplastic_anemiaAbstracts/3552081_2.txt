A 23 years old multiple pretransfused female with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) was used for conditioning, donor buffy coat cells were given as rejection prophylaxis. Seven months after BMT regular menses started in the absence of exogenous hormonal manipulation and 21 months after BMT the patient became pregnant. Pregnancy was complicated by mumps in the 14th week. It was terminated at term by cesarean section. The normally developed newborn girl (3,450 gm) presented with a "persistent fetal circulation syndrome". After surgical correction of the patent ductus arteriosus Botalli the girl baby recovered quickly.
