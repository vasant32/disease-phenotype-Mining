The influence of bone marrow fibroblasts in healthy subjects and patients with aplastic anemia on normal erythroid colony formation was studied using the methylcellulose method. These fibroblasts were treated with methylprednisolone as well. Bone marrow fibroblasts of healthy subjects and patients with aplastic anemia, and the supernatant of their conditioned medium significantly inhibited normal erythroid colony formation. A significantly marked inhibition of normal erythroid colony formation was observed of bone marrow fibroblasts (or the conditioned medium) of the aplastic anemia, when compared with that of the bone marrow of healthy subject fibroblasts (or the conditioned medium). By treating both groups of the bone marrow fibroblasts with methylprednisolone the inhibition was slightly improved. From the above experimental results, it was suggested that the bone marrow fibroblasts and the conditioned medium inhibited normal erythroid colony formation through humoral factors secreted by the fibroblasts, and through contact between the fibroblasts and erythroid colony formation cells.
