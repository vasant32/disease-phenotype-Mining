We report the case of a fatal myofascial necrosis caused by an imipenem-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila in a patient with a history of aplastic anemia. He presented with fever and left thigh tenderness. The CT scan was consistent with cellulitis and, after cultures were obtained, empirical treatment with imipenem and amikacin was started. Two days later, necrotic bullae appeared on his thigh, and cultures showed Aeromonas hydrophila which was imipenem-resistant. Although surgical debridement was performed and ciprofloxacin was initiated, the patient died.
