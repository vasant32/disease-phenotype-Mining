Sixty-four patients with aplastic anemia were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG Merieux) between 1980 and 1985. The actuarial survival for all patients was 53% at 6 years, with 79% survival for nonsevere aplastic anemia (NSAA) and 36% for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The neutrophil and platelet counts before treatment with ALG were highly predictive of survival, whereas sex, age, and etiology were not. Duration of disease prior to ALG treatment was inversely related to survival, although this was not statistically significant. Survival was closely associated with response to ALG, especially for patients with SAA. The response to one course of ALG was 33%. Eighteen patients who did not respond to an initial course of ALG received a second course; of these, four (22%) responded. The overall response to one or two courses of ALG was 40%. The mean RBC volume (MCV) measured after ALG treatment was a useful early indicator of response. Both the minimum lymphocyte count during ALG therapy and the mean lymphocyte count after therapy, however, were not significantly different between responders and nonresponders. The disappointing survival of patients with SAA in this study may reflect the poor clinical condition of severely affected patients referred to us and/or the presence of longstanding aplasia. The importance of studying a large series of patients with long-term follow-up to assess ALG in the treatment of aplastic anemia is shown by this investigation.
