Sweet's syndrome presenting with malignancy or acute neutrophilic dermatosis is an unusual cutaneous disorder associated most commonly with acute myelogenous leukemia. Although other cancers may be linked to acute neutrophilic dermatosis, a large majority of patients have associated neoplasms of hematopoietic, plasma cell, or lymphoid nature. We report a patient with aplastic anemia who showed acute neutrophilic dermatosis and, ultimately, acute leukemia. The individual lesions responded to carbon dioxide laser surgery.
