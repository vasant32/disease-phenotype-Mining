This case report examined whether a 26-year-old man with a 5-year history of nonsevere aplastic anemia could perform aerobic training and whether exercise was beneficial. Testing was performed at baseline and at 8 and 16 weeks and included complete blood tests, graded exercise tests with breath-by-breath gas analyses, and health status assessment with the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-12 health survey. Training consisted of treadmill walking for 25 minutes, 3 days a week for 16 weeks, at 75% of maximal heart rate. The patient successfully completed 16 weeks of training and had no adverse effects from testing or training. Training did not produce changes in disease-related measures (hematologic values) or impairment measures (cardiopulmonary measures of fitness). The mental component of the SF-12 improved from below 2 standard deviations from the population mean to within 1 standard deviation of the population mean. The benefits of aerobic training for this person with aplastic anemia were that he showed that he could participate in aerobic-type activities and that training appeared to improve his mental health.
