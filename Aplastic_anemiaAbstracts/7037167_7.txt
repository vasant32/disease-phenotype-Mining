Chromosome and sex chromatin studies have contributed significantly to the evaluation of human bone marrow transplants. In addition to their use in documenting bone marrow engraftment following transplantation, they have been used to (1) evaluate whether recurrent leukemia occurs in donor or recipient cells and whether recovery in aplastic anemia results from growth of host or donor cells, (2) demonstrate the bone marrow origin of pulmonary macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells, (3) show that bone marrow fibroblasts have an origin different from that of the hematopoietic bone marrow cells, (4) evaluate twin zygosity in preparation for transplantation, and (5) show that the defect in Fanconi's anemia is intracellular.
