Content of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and the activity of ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase and AMP-pyrophosphorylase were studied in erythrocytes of healthy persons and of patients with various types of anemia. Deficiency of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and a decrease in the activity of enzymes studied were observed in erythrocytes under microspherocytic and hypoplastic anemia. The alterations correlated with impairments in energy metabolism. At the same time an activation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate enzymatic system and an increase of its content in erythrocytes did not depend on energy metabolism in Marchiafava--Micheli disease.
