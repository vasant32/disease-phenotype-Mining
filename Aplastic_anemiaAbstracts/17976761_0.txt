We describe a 26-year-old female patient, who had attempted suicide with Endosulfan, and who presented to the Emergency Department with status epilepticus. She subsequently developed hypotension refractory to inotropes, intravascular hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), metabolic acidosis and, finally, cardiac arrest and death. Endosulfan is a chlorinated insecticide that causes central nervous system hyperstimulation. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and respiratory tract, and leads to nausea, vomiting, paraesthesia, giddiness, convulsion, coma, respiratory failure, and congestive cardiac failure. Hepatic, renal and myocardial toxicity, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, cerebral edema, DIC, thrombocytopenia, and skin reaction also have been reported. Management includes decontamination of skin and gastrointestinal tract, supportive care including treatment of status epilepticus, dysrhythmias, and mechanical ventilation. Mortality and morbidity rates are very high and there is no specific antidote. Atropine and catecholamines should be avoided.
