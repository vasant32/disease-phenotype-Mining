The International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry is an organization devoted to scientific research in BMT. More than 230 transplant teams worldwide contribute detailed information about recipients of allogeneic and syngeneic BMT for study. Results of analyses are published in medical journals and presented at national and international scientific meetings (more than 60 publications and more than 500 presentations in the past 4 years). This collaborative research program has grown rapidly with more than 2000 cases reported annually. This report summarizes results of several recent investigations and reviews the state of BMT in leukemia and aplastic anemia.
