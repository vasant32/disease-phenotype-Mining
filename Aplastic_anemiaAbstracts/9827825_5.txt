An 11-year-old boy with severe aplastic anemia underwent unrelated BMT following TBI, antithymocyte globulin and CY. On day +23, CMV antigenemia was detected which resolved with ganciclovir. Eight days after discontinuing ganciclovir, he complained of impaired visual acuity. Ophthalmologic findings and a positive PCR study using anterior chamber fluid from the right eye confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of CMV retinitis, although CMV antigenemia and PCR studies using PBMC were then negative. He was successfully re-treated with ganciclovir. CMV retinitis should be considered even when CMV antigenemia is not present or PCR using PBMC is negative.
