The aim of this study was to find new idea for clinical treatment of aplastic anemia. Immune-mediated aplastic anemia mice were developed, IL-3 in the supernatant with PHA stimulating splenic cells was detected by ELISA, semi-quantiting analysis of IL-3R was performed by point hybridization. The results showed that the IL-3 level in the supernatant with PHA stimulating splenic cells of immune-mediated aplastic anemia mice was higher than controls, difference between them was significant (P <0.001), while amount of IL-3 receptor by semi-quantiting analysis was lower than control significantly. In conclusion, the IL-3 receptor expression level is important for pathogenesis and treatment strategy of aplastic anemia.
