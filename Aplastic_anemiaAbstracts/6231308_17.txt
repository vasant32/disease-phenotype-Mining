By using a combination of a heterologous antiserum to GPIb/glycocalicin and a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to GPIb/glycocalicin, we were able to develop a sensitive and specific radioimmunoelectrophoretic assay that can distinguish small amounts of glycocalicin from GPIb. Normal plasmas were found to contain glycocalicin, even in samples treated with protease inhibitors and centrifuged extensively to remove platelets and platelet fragments. Confirmation that the plasma antigen had a relative molecular weight similar or identical to glycocalicin was obtained from studies employing gel chromatography and affinity chromatography. An immunoradiometric assay was developed to quantify plasma glycocalicin, and normal plasma was found to contain approximately 1-3 micrograms/ml. The plasma of a patient with severe thrombocytopenia due to aplastic anemia had less than 12.5% of the normal level of glycocalicin, whereas two patients with thrombocytopenia due to diseases of increased platelet destruction (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome) had normal levels. Thus, there appears to be ongoing catabolism of platelet GPIb in vivo, and we postulate that the plasma level of glycocalicin reflects a complex function of factors, including platelet count, platelet turnover, and the site of platelet destruction.
