The results of spleen exstirpation in 129 patients with hypoplastic and aplastic anaemia are presented. For this purpose the role of splenectomy in connection with blood formation is dealt with on the basis of analysing morphological blood findings. The impact of the duration of the disease, of sex, age, and the dosage of corticosteroids on the postoperative development of the disease is demonstrated. The following observations of the patients which were made within 3 to 14 years after the operation revealed that 63 patients from 129 survived, namely 21 patients up to 5 years, 26 patients up to 10 years, 16 patients up to 14 years. 66 patients died, the highest lethality being observed during the first year after the operation (47 patients).
