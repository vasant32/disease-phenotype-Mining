We evaluated the biologic characteristics and effectiveness of immunosuppressive agents in patients with a severe form of aplastic anemia in a multicenter study. Treatment with a bolus of methylprednisolone (mPSL) was associated with a good response and a partial response in 19.4% and 1.4% of the patients, respectively. In contrast, two kinds of antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) were effective for 9.4% and 15.6% of the severe form of aplastic anemia, and two kinds of antithymocytoglobulin (ATG) were effective in 30.8% and 37.2% of the patients, although the difference between ALG and ATG was not statistically significant. We recommend that patients diagnosed as having severe aplastic anemia should be referred as soon as possible for treatment with immunosuppressive agents or bone marrow transplantation, the latter depending on disease severity, age, and potential availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor.
