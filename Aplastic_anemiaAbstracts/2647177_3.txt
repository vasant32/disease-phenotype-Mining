A 2-year-old boy underwent bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. Eighteen months later he developed chronic lung disease and dryness of the eyes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed obstruction of the nasolacrimal ducts and marked dilatation of the lacrimal sacs bilaterally. It seems likely that the nasolacrimal duct obstruction was a manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease.
