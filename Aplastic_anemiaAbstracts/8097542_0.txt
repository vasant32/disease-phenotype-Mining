Clonality analysis, by means of polymorphisms of X-linked genes and their methylation patterns, was performed in 41 female patients with various types of refractory anemia. Bone marrow cells, peripheral blood cells, and granulocytic and lymphocytic fractions were analysed by Southern blotting with PGK, HPRT, and M27 beta probes. Clonal hematopoiesis was evidenced in 8 of 19 patients with aplastic anemia, 4 of 6 patients with RA or RARS, 3 of 7 patients with PNH, and 5 of 9 patients whose hematological characteristics did not meet the criteria of either of these entities. For aplastic anemia, clonal hematopoiesis was demonstrated in higher frequency in the patients who had longer history after diagnosis. In refractory anemia, as a whole, no clear correlation was observed between existence of clonal hematopoiesis and morphological characteristics of hematological cells.
