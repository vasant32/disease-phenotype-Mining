A total of 21 multiply transfused patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) were treated with bone marrow transplantation between March 1985 and September 1990: 20 allogeneic and one syngeneic transplants. A positive response in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) was also noted in 7 allogeneic recipients. Pregraft conditioning included high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) 200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, followed by 300 cGy total-body irradiation the day before BMT. Seventeen patients older than 14 years received additional donor buffy-coat cells infusion for 5 days posttransplant. A combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine was used for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease. Seventeen patients were alive with a functional graft, and Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates showed a 80.95% probability of survival at 67.7 months. There were 4 deaths: two died of primary graft failure, one from secondary rejection, and the other from chronic GVHD-related complications. Acute GVHD, grade I was noted in only one patient (5.6%). In contrast, chronic GVHD was observed in 10 out of 18 (55.6%) evaluable patients. Venoocclusive liver disease and interstitial pneumonitis were not diagnosed. Our findings indicate that the combination of CY/TBI/BC is well tolerated and results in a low incidence of graft failure/rejection in multiply transfused Chinese patients who received transplants for SAA. The MTX/CsA combination was confirmed as being remarkable in reducing the incidence and severity of acute GVHD. For patients with SAA under the age of 40, with an HLA-identical sibling, we highly recommend BMT as the treatment of choice.
