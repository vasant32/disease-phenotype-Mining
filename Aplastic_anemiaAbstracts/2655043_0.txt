The therapeutic results obtained in 27 patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) have been studied retrospectively. Ten patients underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 17 received antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Five of the ten patients transplanted (50%) are living and show normal hemopoiesis. Although prophylaxis was used, the incidence of host-versus-graft disease (grade II-IV) was 40% and concomitant pneumonitis was the main cause of death. Twenty courses of ATG were given to the 17 patients. 12 responses were achieved (60%), of which two were complete and the remaining were partial. Two patients who did not respond initially and one who recurred responded to a second course. Eleven patients survived (64.7%) of which 10 were disease-free (58.8%). One of them had remission controlled with cyclosporine. The probability of long-term survival is 48% in the group transplanted and 61.6% in the group treated with ATG, showing no statistical differences.
