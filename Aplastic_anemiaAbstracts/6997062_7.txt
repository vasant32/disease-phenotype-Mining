A 29-year-old woman with severe idiopathic aplastic anemia was given immunosuppressive therapy with procarbazine, 37.5 mg/kg, antithymocyte globulin, 36 mg IgG/kg, and cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/kg. This was followed by a marrow transplant from her HLA identical sister, immunosuppressive therapy with intermittent methotrexate for 3 months postgrafting and ultimate restoration of hematopoiesis. Two years after transplantation the patient delivered a healthy male infant. This is the first successful pregnancy after a high dose chemotherapy and marrow transplantation for treatment of aplastic anemia.
