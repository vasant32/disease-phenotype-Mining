A new immunoglobulin (Ig) for intravenous use was given in high doses to 4 children with refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and 2 children with idiopathic aplastic anemia (IAA). Within 5-10 days after initiation of Ig therapy the platelets of the children with ITP rose to 300,000-650,000/mm3 and could be maintained at normal levels with one Ig infusion every 1-3 weeks. No reaction was observed in the 2 patients with IAA.
