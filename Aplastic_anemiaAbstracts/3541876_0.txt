Between 1981 and 1985, 27 patients with aplastic anemia have been treated by immunosuppression with antilymphocyte globulin and prednisolone or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Fifteen have undergone bone marrow transplantation and have an actuarial survival at 54 months of 65% +/- 12% (95% confidence limits). There have been four deaths from graft rejection, septicemia (two), and graft-versus-host disease. Twelve have received antilymphocyte globulin and have an actuarial survival at 56 months of 67% +/- 21%. Five of these now have a normal blood count and two have had good partial responses and are self supporting. Of the five non-responders, three survived, two with persistent aplasia and one after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Two are dead, one of hemorrhage and one after mismatched bone marrow transplantation. In this study antilymphocyte globulin produced survival equivalent to bone marrow transplantation although only 58% of patients had a response to the antilymphocyte globulin. The advantages and disadvantages of these two methods of treatment are discussed.
