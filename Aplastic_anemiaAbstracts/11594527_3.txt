Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was suggested to occur by immune dysregulation mainly in association with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here we present a patient who developed severe AITP after BMT. A 40-year-old woman with severe aplastic anemia received a BMT from a partially HLA-matched brother. Despite myeloid and erythroid engraftments, platelet recovery was delayed. All bone marrow cells were 46,XY and were derived from the donor. Grade I acute GVHD involving skin developed from day 34 posttransplantation, but promptly responded to prednisolone in addition to a prophylactic dose of tacrolimus. With the tapering of prednisolone, thrombocytopenia progressed without substantial changes in the white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, or reticulocyte count. On day 188, the patient developed chronic GVHD involving skin and liver, which promptly responded to the readministration of prednisolone and increased tacrolimus. However, the patient's platelet count decreased to 9 x 10(9) cells/L on day 222. The platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (PAIgG) values were elevated. Bone marrow examination showed hypercellularity with plentiful megakaryocytes. The number of colony-forming units-megakaryocyte was within the normal range. The elevated PAIgG values and a correlation between thrombocytopenia and the intensity of the immunosuppressive agents strongly suggested a causative role of the autoimmune mechanisms for thrombocytopenia in this patient.
