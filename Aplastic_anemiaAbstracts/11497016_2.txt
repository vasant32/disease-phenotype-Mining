Fanconi's anemia (FA) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by a progressive pancytopenia, diverse congenital abnormalities and increased predisposition to malignancy. Sixteen children with FA, aged between 4 to 16 were divided into two groups according to treatments. Nine children had bone marrow transplantation and seven children were treated with steroid and/or anapolan. The changes in dental caries, caries-associated microflora, salivary status and periodontal health were investigated in children with FA. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. A statistically significant difference was found in hematological findings between children who have received bone marrow transplantation (BMT+) and the others, who have not received (BMT-). There was no significant difference in dental caries experience, salivary flow rate, buffering capacity, mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli levels between the study groups. A statistically significant difference was found in gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing depth scores between the patients with FA in BMT(+) and BMT(-) groups (p<.05). In conclusion, besides systemic control, additional preventive measures during their whole life to maintain oral health is necessary in these children.
