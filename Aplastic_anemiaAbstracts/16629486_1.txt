In 2001, a 45-year-old man with severe aplastic anemia received a bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-identical sister, 2.5 years after which he developed severe liver dysfunction together with abdominal pain, disturbance of consciousness and generalized vesicles. Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection was diagnosed by the detection of VZV DNA. Acyclovir and plasma exchange rapidly controlled his VZV-related symptoms and signs. Disseminated VZV infection is often fatal, but acyclovir and plasma exchange may be useful for such infection by reducing the circulating viral load.
