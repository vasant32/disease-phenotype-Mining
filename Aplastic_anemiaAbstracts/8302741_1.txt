A 12-year-old boy had striking reticulate hyperpigmentation of the neck and upper chest, dystrophic nails, patchy alopecia, and a white streak on the buccal mucosa. He was diagnosed as having chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) based on clinical findings, skin biopsy findings, and his history of a bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia eight years earlier. Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) was not a diagnostic consideration, although the clinical findings and history of aplastic anemia made it a compelling possibility. This case highlights the clinical similarities between DC and chronic GVHD and the difficulty in arriving at an unequivocal diagnosis.
