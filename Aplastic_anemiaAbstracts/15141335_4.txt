Listeria monocytogenes is highly susceptible to meropenem in vitro, but data on the efficacy of meropenem in clinical cases of listeriosis are scarce. Described here is the case of a child with aplastic anemia who acquired nosocomial listeriosis and failed to respond to initial meropenem therapy. Resolution of fever was not noted after 5 days of therapy with meropenem and, more importantly, clinical worsening was observed during this period. The patient began to improve after ampicillin was introduced to the therapeutic regimen. In total, meropenem was administered for 15 days and ampicillin for 10 days.
